Digital_Software,Too much involved.  does not deliver what it's explained as.,1
Digital_Software,"Didn't think I would be complimenting a MS product, but I really like the 2013 version of Word and Excel. The top menus are convenient and all the old short cut key strokes work, as far as I can tell. For someone new, it may be a little cumbersome to click back and forth between screens, if they didn't know the shortcuts. The right-click short menus make things very easy. The program has lock up a few times, which I'm not happy about, even though it tries to recover. I haven't lost any work, but its a major pain in the ASCII when you're in the middle of working on a Word doc.",4
Digital_Software,"A reasonable person reading the title of the product would assume that both Federal and State E-Filing is included. But in fine print in one line, it says, state print tax included, e-file extra! And indeed, when I tried e-filing, it asked for an additional $24.99. The name of the product should clearly state that it only includes E-filing for federal, and PAPER filing for one state.",1
Digital_Software,You really messed up a good product this year!,2
Digital_Software,WordPerfect is the best word processor for the documents I create. I gave it a 5 star rating because I can do things with this program that cannot be done in Word or in other word processing programs. I can print notes in two columns on the page and provide page numbers for each half page. This is handy for notes for preaching. I can then tuck them into the front of my Bible and have them with me.<br /><br />Wordperfect will also allow balanced newspaper columns. Word demands that you add extra lines and do other funky things to get balanced lines on the page. I don't now how WordPerfect allowed itself to become the second place word processor. It has some really great stuff going for it.,5
Digital_Software,Unfortunately this version is lacking functionality.  Does not have auto reconcile and is not as intuitive as the PC version.,2
Digital_Software,"I have used Outlook 2003 for, well, the last 11 years, and it has served me reasonably well.  The information and functions are overall cleanly and clearly presented, and easy to read and customize for the way I use the program.<br />I installed Office 2013 and was immediately shocked by how absolutely ugly, cluttered and confusing the Outlook 2013 GUI turned out to be.  It is difficult to navigate, and does not appear to have many useful options for customizing the flat, washed out view.  Plus, it was turtle slow and the program would \\""hang\\"" frequently for no apparent reason (I'm running Windows 7 on a relatively new machine, so that should not happen).<br />I'm willing to admit that part of my reaction may have been due to the many changes over several versions of Outlook (2007/2010) that I have not used, but I still think the overall look, feel and performance of Outlook 2013 is a total mess.<br />Despite its shortcomings (including the fact that Microsoft will no longer support it), I went back to the Office 2003 for the time being.  Since I can't return software and get my money back, I'll hang on to the new version and install it when I absolutely have to.  Ugh.",1
Digital_Software,"Nothing against the vendor selling this, but..Well... Read the reviews... Heard but didn't listen... Even though I opted out for alerts, started getting emails from Quicken... Really surprised me, as I thought &#34;no meant no&#34;... And also thought my interest rate was a lot lot lower than 1,299%! And also thought that when I &#34;memorized&#34; payees it would remember...but no... First and last time user...",1
Digital_Software,"I've been a loyal TT Deluxe user since the '90s.  This year I discovered that I had to upgrade to Premier to get the same functionality as in previous versions of TT Deluxe.  I wish that I had known this several months ago.  So I've upgraded to Premier because I don't have the time to go through a learning curve this year.  I assure you, I will never, ever buy an Intuit product again.  TaxAct looks pretty good to me.<br /><br />I particularly liked this quote:  &#34;TurboTax spokesperson Colleen Gatlin told NBC News the company has been ‚Äúvery proactive‚Äù in letting people know what‚Äôs going on. ‚ÄúThe majority of the customers who understand the changes are OK with it,‚Äù she said.&#34;<br /><br />I haven't found anyone who was OK with paying $40 more for the same product contents that were included in previous years.  Me thinks Ms. Gatlin is either stupid or a liar.",1
Digital_Software,"Norton is good, there customer service was amazing but because I purchased a download from Amazon they have no record of the purchase and upon contacting Amazon they said once you hit the download button it is considered a used product and they do not do returns or refunds so Norton's 30 day money back guarantee means nothing..so please do not purchase the download version through Amazon..I have never had any other issues at Amazon and will still recommend them continue to shop from them,but no more downloads",3
Digital_Video_Games,"This game, by all rights, should be one of the worst games ever, but instead, it's one of the most hilarious and awesome games, lol. Yes, it is actually a bad game....but that doesn't stop it from being addictive, fun, and over the top funny at all. In fact, this is a game that you will revisit over and over, trying new things, trying to get seemingly impossible achievements until finding success, and generally just wreaking havoc along the way. Who would have thought playing as a goat would be so much fun?<br /><br />I've mostly stuck with Goat Town at this point, although I have run around Goat Town Bay a little bit. The Bay has a bit more glitchy imperfection at this point (I dare say, more than is intended), but I imagine the developers will continue to work on that particular area. Mostly though, when you encounter bugs in the Town, they are intended...or at least, they were intentionally left there to make the game even more quirky, lol.<br /><br />It does have full controller support, which I appreciate.<br /><br />Overall, I would give this game a 9 out of 10. You definitely need to play this game.",5
Digital_Video_Games,"If the price changed for you too, go to the microsoft store online. They have the xbox live 12 month gold membership download for $39.99 I just bought it. Hope this helps!",5
Digital_Video_Games,A very good bargain at $10 off the normal price for cartel coins.  It was very easy to purchase this from Amazon and the code arrived on-screen immediately.  You just have to go in to your SWTOR account and enter the &#34;code&#34; and you've got your cartel coins.  Very simple.,4
Digital_Video_Games,"No option for different camera views, have to access a menu to retry races instead of given the option instantly. Controls are sloppy and unresponsive.  Everything is done through a horribly un-intuitive and confusing menu.<br /><br />Some nice looking cars.",2
Digital_Video_Games,thanks,3
Digital_Video_Games,fun at first boring after awhile takes to long to advance. if you like farming it will be fun.<br /><br />Dan,2
Digital_Video_Games,The game definitely shows it's age. The story line is very linear. Played for two hours and had to stop because it was boring and the controls were driving me crazy.,2
Digital_Video_Games,"I am usually fond of FPS games that are more intuitive in control and have realistic graphics. It was hard to control the tanks, most graphics were low resolution and hence difficult to understand what is really happening.",1
Digital_Video_Games,The Porche is a fun car and made it worth paying for this pack!! The Boost amount was also a key factor in my decision...it was enough to get another car and a card pack!! :) The the V3NIMOUS plate is bit over used!!! Thank you!!,3
Digital_Video_Games,The Mass Effect Trilogy is the best! Only problem I have with it is that it is through Origin and Mass Effect 3 doesn't come with From Ashes DLC. But that is fine!,4
Gift Card,Hard to go wrong with a gift card from Amazon.com.  My son does a lot of his shopping on Amazon so this was a great thank you gift.,5
Gift Card,Amazon's gift cards are awesome!  I've received a lot of them through the years and I always love them. One of the best things is that there is no expiration date.,5
Gift Card,Great gift - can't go wrong if he picks it himself!  Would get again next year.  Hope he gets me the same.,5

Gift Card,The Best!!!,5
Gift Card,A great way to give a $20.00 gift and put a smile to a boy's birthday!  Loved the song and animation of the card!  I was asked to assist a 6 year old boy find a gift for his older brother who was having a birthday. Both giver and receiver were pleased!,5
