{"product_category":"Digital_Software","input":"I downloaded this product and installed it on my PC.  A few days later I launched the product and it immediately errored off.  Tech Support for Intuit Turbotax suggested I file using their web interface and they would refund me the Amazon purchase price.  A month and a half later, no refund, and a call to Intuit Turbotax tech support gets me a different story, and the most they'll refund me is the cost of my online filing.  So, I am only out a few dollars.    Avoid the downloadable version of this product.","star_rating":1}
