4,Excellent. Looking forward to Windows 10.
3,"I have used various versions over Norton over the years and I have never had problems with viruses slipping through. Finding sale prices is usually not too difficult, but renewal prices are WAY too high. (Just buy a new version the next year on sale to add-on for a much lower price than auto-renewal.)"
1,I do not like the new budget outline it's very difficult to use.  Also had to find it in the Planning section.
1,"Quicken 2015 release 8 will not recognize or remember my vault password. This was one of my reasons to upgrade. I've been on the help line with several different people and none have helped one bit, have spent hours trying to clear this problem. I see others have this same problem and to create a &#34;Remember Password&#34; is basic programing and yet Quicken can't get it. One person brought up &#34;why is password needed as bank/brokerage requires it&#34;, i.e. why is a password needed to get online?"
4,These dopes think I'm going to write something here. Nuts to them.
4,Not too much to say.  It's workin' fine.  I<br />'originally' purchased it from the manufacturer<br />but my computer crashed 'cause of a virus & the<br />program along with everything else was removed for<br />precaution.  The manufacturer did not replace it free so<br />I severed ties with them & re-purchased it thru you at a 'much<br />better' price.  Should I encounter the same problem in the future<br />(crash or virus) I can simply go to the amazon site & retrieve it from<br />my purchases & re-innstall it.  THANKS EVER SO MUCH for being there!
0,The VBA programs I developed do not work the same in this version.
0,I have norton on my computer and they wanted $79.00 to renew it. Amazon had it for $32.00 so i purchased the PC download<br />version. Two hours later it still is not working. So I have given up and ask for a refund. It should not be that hard to download<br />and install software. And i still blame Norton for charging so much for a renew.
2,It's great but still a resource hog.
3,The download and installation were problem-free. I was able to load in my TurboTax records from the previous year. Be sure to perform a software update after installation.
0,I was using Quicken 2012 and it was working perfectly fine until I received the message that it would no longer connect to my bank and other financial institutions.  Intuit programs this into the software intentionally - which I find reprehensible.  The only reason I upgraded was because I couldn't find another comparable software that would do the same thing.  As soon as I can find something I'm going to switch.
3,"I've used TurboTax for years. I've heard people say it doesn't cover all aspects of deductions. I say BS (to put is simply).  For those with simple tax returns, Turbo is more than most will ever need.  Yet, if you have many expenses/deductions across the board, Turbo will cover them all.<br /><br />I'm in Law Enforcement, own a property, give to charity, home energy improvements, etc. Turbo covers ALL areas of deductions and tax preparation.  TT covers all my standard deductions; mortgage interest, property taxes, work expenses (equipment costs, labor dues, education expenses), energy efficient upgrades to the house, charitable donations, tax software, medical, you name it.<br /><br />My father spent years doing taxes by hand. He finally used Turbo Tax to file his returns related to not just my folks, but the combining of trusts of his parents into his own. It all was covered in Turbo Tax<br /><br />If you make charitable donations during the year, considering using ItsDeductible online (another Intuit software).  The benefit is goods are valued based on national averages.  Those jeans you gave to good will for free, have a fair market value of $10.  I'm continually amazed at what people donate to charities like Goodwill, who never deduct the goods, which is perfectly legal to do.  ItsDeductible lists 1000s of items for donation and assigned a value.  Few realize, you are allowed to deduct the &#34;fair market value&#34; of goods you donate. So, if Goodwill sells jeans for $10, that is what you deduct.  ItsDeductible has made my donations easy, good value and when you use TurboTax, it will import your donations from I.D. into your tax return."
4,"This is one of the best accounting application I have ever used. It is great. Easy to deal with. Clear. And the reports are fantastic. I used it for many companies. Some were using other accounting apps, while others were using many excel sheets. The migration was easy using third party application to have excel sheets match the QuickBooks format.<br /><br />I only can say that QuickBooks is the best.<br /><br />Faihan Otaibi<br />Saudi Arabia<br />faihan.otaibi@gmail.com"
0,"I spent almost 6 hours trying to get this to work via an Ethernet cable between a new PC (Windows 7) and an old machine (Windows XP).  Finally, my intelligence was truly insulted by the Company's 3rd party, tech support company, iYogi.  In order to make this program work I needed to clean up some malware.  He'd do that for me for $116 then he'd see if he could make the the PCMover do its thing, but no guarantees.  I cleaned up the 'malware' myself and, still no transfer.  Unless you are a glutton for punishment forget Laplink!"
0,Tried to install. Was able to install on a trial basis. So far I have received 57 &#34;please upgrade&#34; notifications.<br />Informed Amazon. No response. Total POS that is a PIA.
3,"As good as Quicken is as a financial tool, the updates seem to generally make changes that still leave holes in the program.  I can also tell from trying other financial software that most of the changes in the last 2 years were to keep up with the competition and not from having original ideas. There are very small changes that could make it much easier to track your finances.  You can't change the color of the fonts, the size or make them boild so you can't customize specific transactions that would make it much easier to track important payments. There is no ability to highlight rows in the register either.  Again making easy recognition difficult.  I can't see how doing this would be a costly change.  I don 't particularly want to make it into a program that dazzles with colors or fancy useless items, but some small basic changes would help.<br /><br />I've used Quicken since it first came out and still use it because overall it is a good, easy to learn program.  But every year I look forward to the new version but alas, it's \\""STILL THE SAME\\""."
2,"I changed to McAfee from Norton and the first thing that I noticed was that my computer became slower, significantly. Not sure that I'll stay with McAfee the whole year..."
2,"Don't like extra charge for eFiling state.<br /><br />Don't like the CONTINUE and BACK radio buttons that are traditional for this software, especially since they're in a different spot on every page so you can't just click without moving your mouse if you want to navigate more than 1 page away. Should use standard Windows back and forward arrows at the top of each page, so they will be fixed in location.<br /><br />Step-by-Step screens with user choice could be better implemented by using drop down menus to select more specific topics, rather than having to go through submenus.<br /><br />Otherwise, this software does what it is supposed to do, which competitors (based on prior years) don't do as well."
2,I was running Quicken 2012 on Win8.1 and was having some weird issues so I decided up upgrade to 2015.  Everything functions the same and the performance issues are mostly gone.  The big add is the mobile feature but I have not felt the need to initiate it since I already have online banking and Mint.com.  It's nice to know I have the latest version and updates with Win10 coming out this summer.
3,Seems to keep me will protected from virus etc.  Have used for over a year (I think)<br />Am not familiar with other like products.  Pop ups remind of status.
1,"I usually use a competitive product, but this product was less expensive, or so it seemed.  The actual process of preparing and filing taxes was relatively easy. However, like others have mentioned, there are poorly worded sections that make it difficult to know exactly what numbers you should be entering.  For taxes this is a big deal, as one wrong number could end up in an audit.  When I went to print a copy, the breakdown was confusing and didn't have any explanations, making me concerned that something was wrong.  I triple checked, and everything looks ok, but what a waste of my time going over everything again and again like that.<br /><br />When I completed the state form, I was shocked and appalled that it asked me for another nearly $20 to file my state return.  You can prepare your state (but only 1 state, the product should have been clear and said federal + 1 state) with the included software, but to efile the state they charge you extra.  You can print and manually sign and file, but when it says federal + state with efile, one expects to efile both for the listed price.<br /><br />1 star was lost for an at times poorly worded processes.<br />2 stars were lost due to the hidden fees and deliberately worded half truths.  I hate hidden fees, it's like charging for martial arts lessons and deliberately not mentioning to customers that there will be high belt test fees any time you want to actually promote.  Dirty.<br /><br />Conclusion:  The program did the job eventually, but I had to mail my state and it'll take much longer to receive my refund.  I do not plan on using this company again, and I do not recommend this product."
0,"i've only been messing with computers since 1990 and i still have a lot to learn. this program misses the mark by about 10 miles. all i wanted was a simple home music recording program that was easy to learn and this definately isn't it. i didn't even bother trying to get a refund, i just got it completely deleted from my machine and figured it to be an enexspensive lesson in what a program shouldn't be."
1,"I was very excited about this product because I wanted to get into editing, however this product took forever to download and on top of that the software freezes. I've had it for about a month and still haven't edit anything because it doesn't want to be responsive. NOT FOR ME !"
2,"Last year I used TurboTax so this year I want to try H&R Block because HRB is much cheaper than TB. Although HRB could do a good job but it took me more time to complete a tax return. Most of the instructions were not very clear to me. Sometimes I was confused, sometimes it explained to much and I had to read too much. At the final step where it's ready to file via mail, I was also confused about the necessary forms for submitting.<br />Besides, the graphical user interface of HRB is not as nice as TB. Now I'm still considering which one I should select for my tax return  next year."
2,BEWARE PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK WITH WIMDOWS XP X64. OTHER 2 UNITS L HAVE WORKS OK. WOULD RECOMMRD FOR 32 BIT SYSTEMS
1,"I only use this for my checkbook, don't need all the other detailed items.  I am not pleased that I had to buy the \\""Deluxe\\"", when the basic would have been best, but I was warned that unless I bought the next expensive one, I could not download from my bank.  I believe this to be another way for Quicken to grab more money.  This only lasts for 3 years. A true outrage!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not good at all.  What exported to Word was a jumbled mess.
2,"Pay attention to the print preview. If you're making a top-fold greeting card, you have to select &#34;booklet&#34; to print it correctly, and you have to move objects up from the bottom or it will not print properly. It shows on the working page that all is within the print borders, but not so on the print preview. It will print exactly how it shows on the preview. I had to go move an object 3 times to get it all on the page, even though it showed on the working page that it was well above the bottom border. I have had the opportunity to use this program, and Printshop Deluxe 3.5, since I got them both for Christmas. For usability and ease of printing, I prefer Printshop. When Encore gets the bugs worked out of it, that program will be superior to this one."
2,Not thrilled. Animation are not what they could be. Choppy and look like they were added as a after thought.
3,Takes little of the processor to run it. Updates silently as it should. Never any issues running with Kaspersky
2,Jury is still out
4,It was easy to download and quick to start using on the new laptop. Would suggest to others and will use the download option again if it is available.
0,"Caution! New TurboTax pricing structure is confusing and heartbreaking.<br /><br />Never again, TurboTax. I've always found the pricing structure of this company to be confusing and a bit gouging. But now they've effectively DOUBLED the price for customers who have a couple of items to put on Schedule C. And the worst part is that lots of people will buy the &#34;deluxe&#34; version this year, because they always buy it, and then discover that they've paid $50 for something that they can't even use.<br /><br />Intuit, you've gone too far. I'm switching to the H&R Block product now."
0,Don't buy it!<br />I just payed 39.99 for this program and at the end the program is asking me again for another 39.99 for e-filing. And on top of that 24.99 to e-file State taxes.  I feel so rip off!
2,takes  to much mem lol
0,"This software doesn't work. Requires you to create a bootable DVD and boot from it. Worked with their support people for hours trying to get it to work. Tried using bootable USB. Booted from DVD and USB drives, but software wouldn't run and caused the MacBook to reboot immediately. After many hours working with their support team, never got it working. To top it all off, they refused to give me a refund saying it was a lifetime license and I could use it in the future. If it doesn't work, how am I going to use it. Note that I purchase directly from the manufacturer and not through Amazon."
3,"The older I get, the more I am concerned about not knowing the questions to ask.  The software is easy to use, but it does not reassure me that I am not leaving some $$$ on the table.  Not their problem if I don't know what I don't know.  I have used this software for more than a few years."
3,It has met my expectations it is good and still works that's what's up I would purchase it again if needed
0,Disaster! Avoid. I have used turbotax exclusively for years. All the other one star reviews explain very well how Intuit ruined their own customer base. Returning my copy and going for H&R Block. I suggest everyone else do the same and demonstrate that the customer is what matters in the end and we can take our business else where.
4,Had it for about 3 years now for 4 different computers with no problems at all.
0,"I purchased this software on December 13 based on the guarantee published on their web site:<br /><br />\\""Risk-Free 200% Guarantee Means You Can't Lose. If you are not completely satisfied with the quality of your Cook'n Software, I will refund your purchase! In fact, I will go one step further and buy you the recipe software product of your choice.\\""<br /><br />I evaluated the software for two weeks and on December 26, I send an email to the address provided in my order confirmation stating that I would like a refund. All the relevant order information was included. I know they received the email because I received an out-of-the-office message stating they would reply after the holidays. In that email, I provided three reasons for my decision which I've listed below and indicated that I would like them to purchase the software of my choice 'Living Cookbook'.<br /><br />As of March 4, I had not received either a refund or the software product of my choice despite three additional emails to the company. One on January 22, one on February 10 and finally one on February 11.<br /><br />On March 4, I filed a dispute with American Express and less than 24 hours later I received a refund, however, I was not provided with the \\""software product of my choice\\"". So much for the 200% guarantee.<br /><br />I am using 'Living Cookbook' and find it a far superior product at less than half the cost of Cook'N.<br /><br />Here are the reasons I chose to return the product for a refund:<br /><br />1) When I view a recipe in 'Living Cookbook', I am able to see both the recipe ingredients, directions and nutrition information all at the same time on the same page. With Cook'N I have to click to a different page and scroll over to see the report of the nutrition data. The report includes all nutrition not just the summary normally included. There is no way to view it all on the same page.<br /><br />2) When I print a recipe with 'Living Cookbook', the format is clean and simple and the nutrition information is automatically included. With Cook'N I have to navigate to a special print configuration page and manually setup the configuration to include nutrition data each and every time I want to print a recipe. Clearly a lot more work.<br /><br />3) I purchased the 'Living Cookbook' import add-on for Cook'N and it failed to correctly import my recipe database. Specifically, it failed to import the folder hierarchy and lumped all the recipes together in general categories, nearly useless.<br /><br />'Living Cookbook' is a far better engineered product and they have taken into consideration user friendliness and efficiency. Cook'N appears to have a lot more bells and whistles, but that about all they are - bells and whistles NOT substance.<br /><br />Four e-mails to the company failed to obtain a refund, but one call to American Express worked like a charm. Ask yourself whether you'll have to call American Express to get tech support if something goes wrong?.<br /><br />UPDATE April 15<br /><br />It's been a month and a half since I initially posted this review.  The owner has responded twice, one of which is a rather lengthy reply. To date, there has been no attempt to provide me with the software product of my choice, the 200% guarantee they make on their web site. If you read his replies, they both appear to be attempts to discredit me rather than fully resolve the issue."
2,"This product is just &#34;OK.&#34; You cannot merge one photo into another, and I NEVER like software that is not simple to use! I was looking for a program that allowed me to merge photos, edit photos, cut and paste parts of one photo on to another photo.... which this program does NOT allow you to do! I have Pixelmator, at half the price, and it does MORE than this program does! I would think that for a $150 dollar program, that it would be the cats A$$... instead of the donkeys A$$."
0,"currently hate it, I ordered download couple days ago and still can not get it to down load, two calls to tech support, three emails and still no one has been able to assist me in getting a successful download. Window 7"
1,"My main issue with this new version of Quicken is that it hasn't been downloading my bank data using the download tab.  It says the update is successful but no new entries show up.  When I log in to my bank, there are entries and I can export them to Quicken manually so at least I can work around it that way.  When I try to reset the online data, I get an error saying it can't connect.  Not sure what's going on, but  I'm probably going to have to waste hours figuring it out.  I've never had this problem upgrading before and I've been using Quicken for many years.  As far as I can tell, the only addition (which I will never use) is the credit score feature.  There are still problems with the entry categories filling out incorrectly too.  Not sure what I'm getting for my money with this \\""upgrade\\""."
1,"Extra $80 total to E-file 2 states... other than that, it was painless."
3,More difficult to use than expected.  Glad I got it on sale and with a coupon.  Probably will not renew.
3,"Great at blocking anything but recently getting more and more annoying . Like this little pop up that asked me to do this review ! And this newer feature that scans for software updates to unrelated software on your computer .  Might not be bad if it had better controls . It is mostly just annoying and rarely does the job right . Says something needs updating when it does . Even though that item might already have an auto update . So why have a software scan something on auto update ! Then when you do ask it to update it often fails to do so . Basically avast is great at blocking viruses and not so great at anything else . And if they keep up their recent annoying useless popups I'm going to be looking for an alternative . Probably AVG or Avira both about as good as avast I prefer avast I think it works a bit better . I've used many antivirus programs . Testing each for a year or more . Avast was the only one that never let me down . AVG , Avira even the ones you pay for ( the paid ones are the worst I might add ) tend to all have some form of popup annoyances ( not the legit popups like real notifications ) . And have add-ons that slow your system and have no real use .Some of these things can be changed in settings . Others can't be stopped by a good hacker ;-/"
4,"Absolutely awesome. After fighting with Norton 360 for over a year, McAfee installs and protects transparently and seamlessly. Easy install - loaded with features - one price protects ALL my mobile devices and ALL my PCs and MACs and Android and iOS devices. And a LOT more than just Antivirus and DOES NOT SLOW DOWN MY PC"
2,"A little hard to learn for an &#34;old person&#34; . But, I am getting used to it. I got it to save using my failing eyes, but the print is very small, and I have to look at it to proofread, so it is not working exactly as I had expected. For a younger person without vision problems, it would be a big help"
2,"I bought the download version for the iMac, recently upgraded to Yosemite.  I finally have it installed after 90 minutes or so of bouncing around.  Part of the problem was the requirement to install a Java program.  In Safari, Apple's browser, when I tried to access the Apple directed page to get the Java program, the page would never load; or if it did, it was invisible. The &#34;community of believers&#34; also had a variety of suggestions, and I am non-tech enough that I'm unsure what to do.  Then, for some reason, there were blocks to installing the program, etc., etc.  I may change my rating after I've used the program, but Mac users need to know the challenges and how long it can take."
1,Turbo Tax gets worse and more expensive every year.
1,"I ran this program as soon as i downloaded it,,, and then had to download the whole thing again with updates. It worked fine as TurboTax usually does. But then I noticed 4 days after filing taxes and quitting the program that it was still running in the background, using 33% of my CPU! ugh. Double check on your Mac using Activity Monitor when you're done to see if your version does the same."
3,Meets and exceeds requirements.<br />I like it. Dont need any additional anti-virus. This Software gets it all done with speed.
2,Incomplete
1,"This is a lousy program compared to its Windows versions. On its face dictation proceeds reasonably well, with the exception that making corrections on the fly is pretty screwy. But, when one compares this to its Windows versions, say Naturally Speaking 12, it's incomprehensible how far performance slides. I honestly don't get it.<br /><br />Nuance - this product is really hurting your brand."
4,It was less than the automatic renewal .
0,Extremely slow apparently due to Cyberlink windows services running which need to be disabled in order to play DVDs.  Also program needs to be blocked in Windows Firewall.  Cyberlink reenables the windows services after updates/upgrades so you have to disable them again.  Finally when you’ve messed around doing all that it can turn out there is no sound.  Pricey. Unreliable.  Uninstalled.
2,"I'd buy this in a heartbeat to support a nice redo of the Kindle for PC and Mac apps! This would include the support for personal documents like the ones this app produces. Until then, no interest in what I assume is a great idea with an average quality solution..."
3,Easy to purchase and download/install. Interview approach works well and import from last year's return makes for quick filing.
0,I had difficulty upgrading only to see where many others had had the same problem.  Will not purchase quicken again.
0,"I'm sure it would be an excellent program if it were for use outside of the USA. They don't mention this fact when purchasing. I live in New Zealand And Quicken will not recognise my bank for auto downloading statements. I cannot seem to manually input either. All in all, it's a complete waste of time and my money. Quicken need to get there act together so all banks are recognised. I am now using a free ANZ money management tool and this seems to recognise all banks and as I said this tool is free. Shame on you Quicken."
3,"Everyone with a PC that access the internet should have protection and AVG makes it simple and complete. I have three preferred brand that I use, AVG Internet Security run on all three of my home computers. It has the features and functions that matter most and keeps you informed. Very user friendly application."
2,It is easy to use but not all inclusive. It is very clumsy to have special considerations for specific people.  It works OK for very basic needs.
3,Worked for me
3,Performs well.
1,kids didn't like it
2,not stable
4,"Great product.  I have been using it since it was known as Tax Cut. Easy to use, that is for sure.  And knowing that the H&R team has my back in case of an audit is a plus."
1,"So far the out of the sharing option the Facebook option works but the share via email just causes the program to hang and freeze.  Its slow and bulky. (Asus Q550lf notebook. Core I7, 8gb ram, 250gb Samsung 840 EVO SSD)"
2,"Works very similar to the previous version that I had (I think 2010 version).  They did add some new streets, but I have noticed others (Northern CA) that are not included.<br />I like Streets and trips a lot, and have use one version or another for years.  But, Microsoft is very slow to add new streets!!!!!!!!!!<br />Do they only have one guy working in the 'new streets' department?<br />When you stop and consider how may of these programs Microsoft sells, you realize that they are making a boat load of money.  They can afford to hire more people to up date their maps more frequently.<br />I wish Google maps was storable on my hard drive, and not internet connection dependent.<br />For now I am stuck with M.S. Streets and trips, I like it, but it could be improved."
3,Works very well just a mater of learning to use it
3,"I wanted to download the new version and tinker with it a bit before importing my data to make sure I liked the interface, functionality, etc.  I've upgraded QB versions in the past and didn't expect the download to automatically remove my old version.  Luckily, the installation when off without a hitch and I was happy with the format/interface.  However, if the download didn't work it would have been a disaster because it deleted the old QB version at the beginning of the installation process.  QB has obviously improved some of the issues users had with the original release because there are options for different color schemes and the font isn't too small (wish I could change the font size and type but oh well).  Also, you can move the icon bar from the default left side of the screen to a top icon bar so it looks like older versions.  It appears that the glitches from the original release have been modified and fixed.  I wish I could adjust the frames on the home screen to shrink down the sections but the only way to accomplish is to adjust the full screen size.  Overall, I am satisfied with the product."
4,CS6 is a GREAT Photoshop product.  Much improved over CS5.
4,"I've used avast for years.  I wouldn't be without it.  The updates are regular and timely.  I also use other antivirus programs because too much antivirus redundancy is never enough, but avast is my primary."
3,"I've been using QB for quite some time and as with each version, they make improvements that make our usage more user friendly and efficient. The reporting and sales tax tracking has improved but the customer credit card entry has some additional steps. I did have some problem installing the PDF writer having conflict with Adobe PDF, but it's minor"
0,"Norton is absolutely the worst antivirus software you can buy. I've worked for a software company, so I know what level of service and support is to be expected from a solutions provider. Firstly, these people charged my credit card for an update that I didn't authorize, then after I notice it and confront them, they make me some sort of sweetheart deal. Only the software keeps crashing my computer and rendering it useless. After several weeks of having them uninstall and reinstall they now tell me that I'm no longer eligible for a refund. Symantec is a complete farce of a company."
1,"This product uses data which apparently is the same data on the Quicken website to update stock prices.  For some reason, Quicken is not updating a significant percentage of these prices, even for S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Stocks.  Generally, about 60% of my stocks get updated, and the other 40% show no change.  I compared the update with the actual prices in my account at my online broker today.  The market had a good day, but my stocks in Quicken showed that the value increased by less than half the amount they actually increased.  Pathetic!!  Intuit should be embarrassed to have let a great product deteriorate from lack of attention as they have with Quicken."
4,Nothing gets past Avast. Every time something trys to get past Avast it grabs it and destroys it and puts it somewhere where I can't even find it.
1,Got hung up on form 1095-A and told me to seek a professional tax preparer - have to wait until March 26 upgrade before software will let me file online says the online chat lady.  Hope it works then or the IRS will be fining me for owed taxes.  :-(
1,"I have just upgraded from Quicken 2009 to 2015 and am disappointed, so far, with this version. Some functions that were useful have been discarded (&#34;file rename&#34; for example) and other functions don't work as one would expect (money transfers from checking to investments get listed as transfers to savings in the In/Out/What's Left window even though they show up correctly in the registers. Other transfers (in my case PayPal) only show up in the registers.<br />The program tends to freeze often and reset custom views to default views on restart and/or startup. There are numerous other problems with the program that I won't go into detail about here except to say many of the same bugs from previous versions are showing up again in this version and I'm talking all the way back to the 90's when I beta tested a version of Quicken.<br />Live help is a whole 'nother review. I'm seriously considering asking for a refund and reinstalling 2009."
3,"It's okay.  I found out I could have bought it at Staples during School Supply Weeks for $5.00.  Or, you can download it for free from their website.  It must think I'm still on the free version; I still get announcements telling me to upgrade to the newest edition, even though I bought it!"
1,"I was a previous user of Quicken 2007, and purchased this expecting similar performance. I tried to create some basic reports and found that the reports section is a joke.  I can't even generate a report that has opening and closing account balances for a specific period of time. This is less than useless because I have already wasted a month and a half tracking transactions in the software. Admittedly, it does allow you to enter transactions and download from online accounts, so I gave it two stars for doing the absolute minimum that one would expect financial software to do.  But this is far from full featured and far from meeting the standards of their previous product. Certainly not worth fifty bucks. They should be embarrassed to have released this incomplete product."
2,A similar product from Norton that I used last year had file backup as part of protection suite - this does not have a backup feature
3,Would be 5 stars with no popups
3,Down loaded information from financial site contained &#34;0.0&#34; in a field and TurboTax did not handle it.  I had to manualy adjust the tax form.
0,"I have been a costumer using Deluxe for better than 15 years. This year I will be looking for other software, rather than be forced into buying the Premier version."
0,"I found it difficult to use, especially the part designed to protect financial websites. it sends you to another place altogether to pay your bills.  It is difficult to figure out how to allow new programs that I want to add. And worst of all, it is deliberately designed to keep you once you sign up.  The customer service number is not free and they tell you up front to expect a 10 minute delay or more. Checking the \\""do not renew\\"" button does nothing and they send the renewal through the bank before the old subscription is up - at the full price I might add. It does nothing for spam (maybe it is not supposed to) Little messages pop up when you least expect them telling you that you have a virus. They sit there and blink in the corner of your screen. You have to manually deal with it on your own. Other ant-virus software at least quarantined them until I could check them. This program makes you stop right then to deal with them. I can find NOIHING that I like about this software."
4,"This is my second year for purchasing McAfee Total Protection, my first year to purchase from Amazon.  I love the program, and it keeps my PC protected.  It was much less expensive to purchase through Amazon."
2,"I purchased this only because planned obsolescence made Quicken 2011 work no longer.  I could not download transactions after 5-2014.  So far this version has crashed once (previous versions never did) and the reconcile feature does not work properly, it keeps trying to balance from the paper statement instead of the online balance.  There are some great new features, showing graphics on loan and mortgage payoffs.  The &#34;what if tool&#34; is a great feature to show how much interest is saved by making extra payments one time or every month.  Overall it's still a very good financial management tool but there are bugs."
4,"Just used it, my computer has been scanned and is now maintenenced!"
1,"Regretfully, this once user friendly product has sold itslef to the highest bidder--\\""weak\\"" Yahoo and \\""total crap\\"" Bing.  If it cleans up it should not force a move to the garbage now sponsoring it.  This is bulls*** and likely the reason I will drop it."
2,Found it hard to understand how to download on my second PC. Had to run the download and installation 3 times.
2,"The product itself is very good.  Comprehensive, mature, with modern internet centric features.  Quite suitable for my needs.  I've also successfully installed the Android app.<br /><br />BUT... I cannot use Quicken for my primary intended purpose, management of all our personal financial affairs, because the Quicken interface with my financial institution will not work properly or consistently.  I've been able to make it work twice for one of my 4 accounts (all with same institution) after hours of screwing around with passwords, 2nd level security keys and so forth.  Plus I have an apparent double post of the same data which negated any benefit from this effort.  The download has not worked right since.  4 more second level key requests for each attempt.  Then none ends up being accepted.  Even worse, each key must be separately requested from the bank, after first deleting browser cookies.  A game with an endless loop that I have chosen not to play.<br /><br />My bank,a large credit union actually, finally ended up saying \\""not supported\\"" after I spend over an hour on the phone with the 1st and 2nd level support staff.  This is their official response even though Quicken pulled them from its authorized correspondent bank list and set up the 1st level conversation successfully.  They use a good 3rd party application for their online banking but my goal here was to use \\""their\\"" transaction data (data they created for me - it's MY data) within Quicken and stop using their free online payments system (which works quite well actually) in favor of the $9.95/month Quicken service.<br /><br />My bank unofficially feels my pain (it seems I'm far from the first customer with this problem) and did volunteer to look into the problem with integrated downloading.  However 4 weeks have pasted now and I've heard nothing back, so I've stopped holding my breath.  I do not plan to use the institution's manual Quicken download feature because of the obvious issues associated with selecting range ranges each time.  This is a poor use of my time (4-5 times per week) and besides, there's mo certainty I would always get the precise results necessary.  I'm not interested in burning hours and hours with Intuit support either.  You know, user forums and level 1 questions, over and over, until a dead end is likely reached: talk to your bank.  I've been there, done that so many times with other products.<br /><br />So then, I'll probably just put this product on the shelf.  Maybe use at tax time, but probably not.  I've found that downloading into a spreadsheet is more suitable for that purpose."
0,"pros:<br />This product is an adequate set it and forget it option.  It does all of the things you'd like your antivirus software to do.  Previously I had used Norton 360 and to be quite honest I was happy with it.  I had no problems with it.  But I kept hearing such good reviews of Webroot that I wanted to give it a shot.  My first impression was of the small amount of system resources this product took, plus the small size of the download.  It immediately installed and started protecting my machine.<br /><br />cons:<br />Personally I find the backup function of this software to be lacking.  It's not anywhere near as reliable on backing everything up as N360 was.  I've got this software on a computer that is on most of the time, and only turned off at night.  It still hasn't backed up all the pictures and documents on it.<br /><br />The password management tool is horrible compared to Lastpass or the Norton Identity safe, or a hundred other password management options.  I really wanted to like it but there are many sites that don't allow auto fill, and you can't just go and look at the password in the webroot software.  It has to auto fill or it won't work.<br /><br />I also wish Webroot would expand the functionality of it's mobile platform.  This being a multiple device, multiple platform solution, it appears that the other options included beyond pc really don't do much.  I've got this app downloaded on my iPhone and logged in through it and into the password management applet.... The web platform still says I have zero devices protected for mobile use.  The browser for iPhone is plain and simply a clunky, slow browser that seems to just tell you.... oohhhh your downloading something, that could be bad."
1,"As a long time Turbo Tax user, I was not happy with Turbo Tax this year.  Somehow Turbo Tax missed my deduction for State and Local Taxes.  I may have skipped over this section, but Turbo Tax should have caught this.  This is a basic deduction anybody itemizing should get.  This resulted in me paying hundreds of dollars more than necessary to the IRS.  The 1040X (amended tax return) form was painful and ultimately just wrong using Turbo Tax.  On-line instructions how to file the 1040X using Turbo Tax were poor saying in general to do different steps, but not telling how to do that using Turbo Tax.  I eventually figured it out, but the 1040X form Turbo Tax printed out was filled out incorrectly, sections of the form directed not to be filled out for my case were filled out.  I had to manually fill out the forms from IRS.gov.  I specifically buy Turbo Tax so I don't have to do that.  I called the Turbo Tax help line in mid February.  The recording said there was a 45 minute wait.  I waited on hold for well over two hours for a agent.  Now I have to wait 16+ weeks to get my 1040X refund from the IRS."
1,I purchased this product hoping it would help in building my family tree but I did not find it user-friedly and it was difficult to navigate and to use.  I did not like it at all.
3,"I originally subscribed to the Create PDF plan for $19.99 per year, but I found that the upload requirements were time consuming, impractical at times, and possibly in violation in certain NDA conditions. The tipping point for me was the inability to convert PDF files to PPT format--one conversion alone from PDF sourced from PPT back to PPT format was worth the time I saved recreating the PPT. With Acrobat Pro, I can perform all conversion and OCR tasks locally and offline while in transit, I can reconvert files back to PPT, and I can install on two computers simultaneously. Take advantage of this pricing if you can. I only wish there was a Pro app for Android to extend the experience."
0,"I have been using Turbo Tax more than 10 years, I don't know causes but I had hard times e-filing State's return for 2014 and had to call TurboTax to purchase by phone. Wait time was almost 2 hours and waste of time. I have to consider alternate software for 2015."
3,"I bought this in April and wanted to spend some time with it before reviewing. I am a teacher - I use word constantly, powerpoint is a mainstay, and excel is a pretty regular application as well. I don't use publisher terribly often, but when I need it, I really, really am happy I have it.<br /><br />For the subscription, I have 5 licenses to use - this is more than enough for my wife and I. The online apps load smoothly - even on my old and somewhat cranky laptop. You can download the applications locally, but I find using the online versions and onedrive works quite well. I DID download the local apps on my primary laptop and my wife's - just in case we don't have wifi access (a rarity these days).<br /><br />I am a fan of onedrive and even happier that I have a terabyte of storage on their cloud. I have never had a problem accessing my folders and files (though I still carry my portable hard drive and kept it backed up on a regular basis - when wifi isn't available is when the principal is going to want some doc or spreadsheet right then and there...).<br /><br />I would have given this another star but I am not loving that I can't use mobile office on my Nexus 7. I don't know if this is Google or Microsoft being petty, but it's pretty annoying. I can still access my files and use the online versions of the productivity apps, so this isn't a total wash. While the apps are limited, I honestly don't do a lot of work on the tablet that requires a degree of sophistication. For the short document or run and gun powerpoint, the app is fine.<br /><br />The subscription also means that I will not have to worry about upgrading - I just pay my monthly fee. My bride and I are both professionals who use productivity software every day. Office 365 makes it quick, easy, convenient, and - so far - reliable."
3,Fun to play with but it is so limited because of the &#34;LITE&#34; version. I'm leary of paying to get the full version.
0,"Don't waste you disk space! This program is an exercise in frustration. There is no auto correct, capitalization is erratic, it offers the rare suggested word but not the most common usage for it, really? It's had to recover the document repeatedly so you have to back everything up in a completely different format. There is no copy and paste option, even from Apache files, you have to insert a file from an outside source. More work than its worth."
2,"Okay, so I've been using Quicken since it was nothing more than a handy carrying case for the stone tablets I used for accounting back in the epoch. And generally I've been pretty happy with it. Sure, there were minor things (usually connectivity with various and sundry financial institutions), but nothing that drove me nuts.<br /><br />Well, now I'm nuts.<br /><br />So here are the issues I have encountered.<br /><br />1. Shortcut keys go dead after download.<br />When I download/sync, the shortcut keys stop working. Ctrl-G, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-Home, Ctrl-End, all of 'em ... I get the cheerful little Windows 8.1 &#34;BONNGG&#34; sound, but nothing happens. The only way to get them working again is to shut down Quicken and restart it.<br /><br />2. Transfers aren't linking correctly.<br />This is a BIG problem, and (speaking as a database administrator, developer, and all around I-know-a-lot-of-stuff type of guy) one that should be fairly simple to fix. What happens is that, after downloading transactions, sometimes one side or the other of a transfer between accounts in Quicken becomes orphaned. So I right click on a transaction and click &#34;go to matching transfer&#34;, and it takes me a) to a transaction that does not match up (i. e. one from two weeks earlier), or b) nowhere, and a dialog box pops up that says, in effect, &#34;Forget it, pal. Ya can't get there from here.&#34; And if I try to delete one and re-enter it to clean it up ... well, if I delete the wrong one (and there's no way of telling sometimes), then I've hosed not just the one transfer but often three or four that have become inexplicably linked together somehow. This is a clear data integrity violation, and can cause real problems with data corruption if it is not addressed PRONTO.<br /><br />3. Downloaded transactions aren't registering correctly or are de-registering.<br />So I sync up with my bank, and it downloads a bunch of transactions, and the matching isn't perfect (it never has been, and that's not a biggie). However, when I go to manually match them up, I find transactions that were apparently never matched from two, three years ago. The thing is, these transactions WERE matched, as evidenced by the fact that I remember doing so (I'm a little OCD about this kind of thing). In addition, when I download the transactions manually into a QFX file and try to import them, Quicken says &#34;Naah, we already covered that&#34; and they don't get imported. Which leads to ...<br /><br />4. Manual downloads are imported into the wrong account.<br />So I have two checking accounts at my bank: a joint account I share with a lovely woman who, for some reason unfathomable to modern science, puts up with my crap on a daily basis and has yet to run screaming for the hills, and an individual account I use for my own stuff (gas, coffee, Hot Wheels, porn, lottery tickets, etc.). The thing is, when I do a manual download from my bank, the QFX file from the joint account gets imported into the individual account and vice-versa. This, my friends, is a regal pain in the posterior region.<br /><br />5. The cloud sync works, sort of. Except when it doesn't.<br />I did a cloud sync, and it came back saying there were a couple of errors, and that I should click on the link for each error to repair them, then click &#34;Apply&#34;. Which is fairly straightforward, except that there were no links. So I'm stuck looking at these errors every time, and with the &#34;There were errors with your last sync blah blah blah&#34; type verbiage that appears EVERYWHERE.<br /><br />6. The register window doesn't hold focus.<br />Sometimes I need to switch to another app while in Quicken (most commonly to copy a confirmation number from an online payment so I can paste it in the memo field). In Q2011 this worked great. In Q2014, when I switch back from whatever it is, the keyboard is entirely useless, and for some reason the File menu is highlighted. The only way I can continue working is to click on the register with the mouse ... and even then it may take more than one click. Not good, Intuit.<br /><br />7. The cloud data can ONLY be accessed from my mobile phone.<br />My Quicken data in the cloud? Fantastic. I can get at it from anywhere ... except work. I work in the basement of a building that sits approximately 15 gajillion miles from the nearest cell tower, such that data transfer on my phone ... well, it would be quicker to write it on Post-It notes and deliver them by hand. That's assuming I can get any signal at all, which only happens on every ninth Wednesday when the sun is shining, winds are light out of the northwest, and Congressional Republicans are in a genial, conciliatory mood toward the President. Which is to say, never. So can I please, please, fer the love o' Mike PLEASE have a web interface into my data that I can access from my PC at work? It'll be our litlte secret, I promise.<br /><br />Look, Quicken ain't perfect. In fact, there are a lot of areas in which it comes up short (being able to force a re-download of transactions would be a nice feature, as would the ability to un-match downloaded transactions after the fact). But it's the least imperfect thing out there, as far as my limited experience has discovered, at any rate. And some of these things I've mentioned (if not all) seem to be the result of sloppy/rushed coding and perhaps a project plan that may have been a bit too ambitious in scope. However, even though many of these things are relatively minor, the data integrity bug is a huge problem. This could lead to people working off incorrect information (thinking they have more in their checking account than they actually do, for example), and if the connection to the bank is not read-only there is the potential to wreak real havoc on the personal finances of anyone who uses the product.<br /><br />My recommendation for the consumer? Until Intuit fixes these things, I'd sit tight for the time being. If you are a Quicken 2011 user, however, you have a limited time, because of Intuit's three year sunset policy ... your version is going offline as of April 30.<br /><br />My recommendations for Intuit? Well, obviously and foremost, FIX THE PROBLEMS. Like I said, they are probably fairly minor coding fixes. However, until these problems are fixed I would recommend halting the sunset policy until they are, so that Q2011 users can continue to use a product that is actually fairly stable and useful.<br /><br />My two cents."
2,I like it
1,"Upgraded from Essentials to 2015 for Mac.  Bill Reminder takes the place of scheduled transactions.  Not a bad interface.  Cloud Sync is available but makes the program run incredibly slow (takes several seconds to record a new transaction).  Also, can't really do much from an iPad or iPhone.  If you want to speed up the program, turn off the Sync feature...or, don't waste your money.  Stick with Essentials....until Intel decides to give Mac users a REAL upgrade."
4,"This program was very easy to download and use. By not purchasing the disk, I was able to save money."
0,"This is nothing like the older versions of Outlook, they do not even have an option for when you flag an email to have a reminder set up at a future date, an essential feature i really need. The look is terrible too."
3,"Lets be Honest, 977Meg download not 1 meg for anyone that only read what was said.<br />(no I didn't expect 1 meg and was highly concerned when it said 1 meg)<br /><br />will update review as I use it.  I am upgrading from Paint Shop Pro 5 by  Jasc."
1,"Our IT consultant suggested we upgrade all of our computers to Office 2010 to transition our Database applications.  That's all fine, but we have one machine still on XP (which is still faster than Windows 7) and there seems to be a glitch with Office such that it loses its configuration on a regular basis.  At least once a week when I start up an office application, it will go into the \\""Product Configuration\\"" screen for about 5 minutes, then require the product key to be entered.  Sometimes it then requires a reboot.  Very annoying, and what's worse, after spending hours trying to get help from Microsoft, I might as well be asking my dog to help.  This is beyond frustrating!"
2,"I have used Norton for a long time and I Would have given them 5 stars for everything that they've done in the past. but this time I have three comments.<br /><br />1.  I thought I had a lot of time remaining on my Norton license (I had not received any warnings about expiration) so I thought that installing this product would simply add to my expiration date, but after installing it only showed 366 days remaining.  I can't say for sure but I suggest you wait until your present license is ready to expire before installing this. (you COULD note your remaining time and call their customer service and they would probably restore any lost coverage; they are very nice)<br /><br />2.  Before you install be sure to EXPORT YOUR OLD LOGINS!!!  The software keeps track of your login IDs and passwords - I love this feature - but all of my old logins disappeared when I installed this.  Luckily I have all this info written down, but it takes a long time to re-enter everything (I have a LOT of logins).  I spent about 45 minutes with their on-line support; I thought they could find the data in the recycle bin or something but it was a wasted effort.  They called twice (I wasn't home either time) and said they would like to try again, but by then I had already started rebuilding the file.<br /><br />3.  Earlier versions seemed to be more intuitive for me to change logins from one directory to another and perform other minor tasks.  I haven't learned how to do some of the things I used to think were simple to do in the past.  I've go multiple logins and passwords for some sites (Me, wife, 2 kids) and when I stumbled across the instructions for creating multiple logins - the instructions told me to click on menu selections that were not present on the menus that were displayed.  Maybe you can chalk this up to user error because just now, when I tried to retrace my steps I can't figure out how I got to the HELP menu that told me what steps to take.  And there's a &#34;Report Issues&#34; menu selection that gave me a &#34;page not found&#34; error last night and this morning but just now I tried and it takes me to a live page that seems that it would allow me to submit my problems.<br /><br />They say Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, but I think I'm going crazy because I'm expecting the same results and not getting the same results."
2,"Version: Deluxe for Mac (10.9.5 Mavericks)  Experiences so far:  Product Code provided by Amazon in a different format than the Activation Code format specified by H&R block, but apparently worked.  Imported TurboTax return from previous year fine (apparently).  Crashed when trying to import W2 from payroll provider.  Tried twice, crashed twice.  Then, because I'm stubborn, I rebooted and tried again.  The import worked after the reboot.    General impressions so far:  Crashing is always bad in a tax program.  Besides that, I probably slightly prefer TurboTax, but I used TurboTax for the previous 17 years, so I was used to it.  H&R seems less inclined to start up again where I last saved, but that's probably just my failure."
2,"Definitely slows the computer down, but main complaint is it apparently does not have ability to remove a lot of the malware or some viruses.  I had one virus that it would it found but would not remove.  I've been a user for many years and have been satisfied, but perhaps there are better solutions on the market."
2,"I have been using Quicken for several years now and am not happy with the new upgrade.  I am still not able to use ipad or mobile version, and whats worse when I am working in the program I continuously get kicked out of the program.  I wish I could go back to the previous version I had!"
3,I like quickbooks but would like a way to talk to a person about issues rather than some faceless person.<br />Thanks
2,"I bought a download direct from Amazon.com.  It would not install.  After messing with it for quite some time, I finally called the 800 number that was posted for help.  They finally got it installed for me, but I am sure they were a scam company, as they wanted $190.00 plus tax for their services.  I didn't have that much left available on my credit card, so they asked how much I had and I told them $70.00, so they charged that amount plus tax, and said they would call me in a week for authorization to charge the balance of  $120.00, plus tax.  They never called me back.  I am assuming that they just knew I wouldn't have any more money to give them, and with all the scamming going on, I had decided they were one of the bad guys, and I would not have given them the authorization anyway.  I thought I was calling Microsoft, but apparently I wasn't, as I have been told that if I had called Microsoft, it wouldn't have cost me anything.  After it was installed, it was working just fine, but I gave it a lower rating because I spent about 5 hours on the phone with those people instead of it just going on to my computer as I had expected. June Anderson"
3,Complaint:<br /><br />When using the bill pay option I now have to tell what to pay and then when I send it I must also click each payment again before they will send.<br />I do not like this feature as it is totally redundent.<br />How do I turn off the ectrra click I have to make before the program will send my payments to the bank?
4,Does everything most people need. I'm self employed and wife works for W-2 wages. Serves us well. Have used this product for about 10-15 years. Will continue to do so.
3,"Pros: - Half the price of TT basic - Opens MUCH faster than TT, and starts at your tax file - All the Forms - Data entry straight forward - Linked data from all forms to 1040 - Forms button on top bar - PDF import - Modest learning curve - All files on my HDD  Cons: - Wanted to load at C:\ not C:\Program Files\ - Had to register to open the software - State nag each time I opened the program  Like all TT users I was appalled at Intuits money grab for 2014. For 30 years I'd been a TT user buying the basic version because it had all the forms I needed (1040, B, C & E), roughly $80 now on TT. I never use the Q&A format, simply wanted the forms and the internal links from each form to appropriate 1040 lines. At the end I run the audit check and file my paper return. I always have to pay, so I include the check with the return.  TaxAct has all the features of TT, just slightly different and a bit of a learning curve. The most notable difference was the form(s) for expanded data for a single entry. TT tended to have custom sub-forms whereas TA used a single generic form for all entries.  The PDF import was straight forward, with 20-20 hindsight I might have imported the massive form set instead of just the return to file. There were no import errors, just a few missing pieces. The alert review found missing data, so no big deal. Both TT & TA start in brain dead Q&A mode but in TA the Forms button was right at the top, TT required you to drill down.  The C: load was contrary to any software in the last 10-years, even had a nag discouraging using Program Files, I did anyway, works fine. Never had a piece of software that I had to register before I could run it. The state nag was a noticeable bother, should have had a &#34;Don't show this again&#34; field."
1,"I was basically forced to upgrade my Quicken 2011 version to 2014 because the online services, such as bank synchronization and stock updates, were being discontinued on the 2011 version.  To me, the new features of 2014 were little or hardly noticeable (at least in what I use Quicken for).  The main difference was a very noticeable slow-down in response times to clicking on things, or just doing basic every-day functions.  Resizing a window was painfully slow. Whoever designed the window resizing routine needs to be schooled.  The most annoying thing with this upgrade has been the focus problems when moving from window to window.  I frequently open a web browser to look up my purchases, etc, and reconcile them back into Quicken. In the past, I would use Alt-Tab to move between the browser and Quicken, and it worked as expected.  Now, when I Alt-Tab back to Quicken, the focus on the Quicken window is not anywhere visible, and especially NOT on the place I left it (like the dollar amount). So, that forces me to reach for the mouse, and move it into the dollar field (where I was just located before Alt-Tab), and click there to get the focus back. The QA department should have caught this before releasing.  I have written a bug on this several weeks ago, but haven't heard any response.  If I wasn't forced into the upgrade to keep Intuit's cash-cow flowing, I would have stayed with the 2011 version."
3,"had great expierance with turbo taxmit was very easy to follow and in filing,"
3,"helps me stay organized; still in the process of building my business, so trying to figure out if it is worth the expense each month since I'm not utilizing it a lot, but definitely a good tool for a small business or individual!"
3,lol what acan i say  it does waht it is suppoose to be for  i guess it works ok wissh it was cheaper
2,"This is a great product but the real dig here is that we have to pay just to comply with our ridiculous tax code in the first place. We need to implement the FairTax and eliminate the IRS. The FairTax is a consumption tax not an income tax so you are not punished for your success and hard work. Plus with the FairTax, you will never have to file another tax return again. Don't believe the 23% rate. That is for the tippy-top spenders. Look it up, you'll like it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0060875496 The Fair Tax Book: Saying Goodbye to the Income Tax and the IRS]]"
1,Annoying amount to be paying to get our taxes done but better than paying an arm and a leg at H&R block.
0,"In 2014 they added a very annoying feature which is not advertised anywhere: every time, every single time you want to update your accounts by connecting to banks, you need to enter Intuit's ID and password. IN ADDITION to the password vault's password and/or bank's passwords.<br /><br />And unlike the password vault's password which you can &#34;unlock&#34; once, when you first connect to the banks and it will not request you to enter it unless you quit the program, this INTUIT ID&password are requested EVERY TIME, even when the password valut is already unlocked. This is incredibly annoying and unreasonable.<br />I had to go back to 2013 version.<br /><br />I am trying got return it to Intuit (they have satisfaction guarantee - they are supposed to mail you check - Amazon would not refund you the money."
3,"I have used this software for years, never any problems. Keep up the good work avast! Even protects my tablet."
4,this software is great to use and always updates to handle possible threats had software from internet supplier but when upgrade computer to window 8  they couldnt keep up so dowloaded avast in place it has been great
0,"Intuit is the king of finding ways to screw their long term clients. With Quickbooks it was turning off electronic banking unless you updated to the new version. With TurboTax it is not giving you state tax anymore, not telling you in any of its literature, and raping you with an exorbitant fee for it after you paid for it and are stuck. The total cost is now approaching the cost of paying someone to prepare it for you."
4,Immediate download. Saved almost $50!
1,"I have used Quicken for many years and had considered upgrading to 2015.  I don't use many of the higher end features, but mainly want a program to help me keep track of my checking account.  Intuit used to have a basic version that was fine for that and it was much cheaper than this &#34;Deluxe&#34; version.  I was seriously considering ordering 2015 since Amazon now has it available for $49.99 instead of the previous price of $74.95.  However, after reading these reviews, many of which are from professionals, I'm having second thoughts and think I will stick with my outdated, but still workable, 2009 version."
2,"Software-wise, it's functional and it does its purpose.  However, they messed up this year with reorganizing the categories of their software as the Deluxe version used to be for both Small Business owners as well as Deductions and Homeowners.  They ended up splitting what software versions were best used for and greatly increased the price of those versions past what it used to cost a few years ago.  This faux pas as well as the ever increasing price of the software has soured the experience for many longtime users (especially if you've seen the news about TurboTax this tax season).  If you don't mind paying the increase (used to hover around $30-$40 years ago, is more like $50-$60 now), then this software will be fine for you.  But I'm considering trying another software next year, mainly because of the price but because the other software brands now are able to recognize and extract TurboTax files, so I can just transfer an information from my previous return into the new software.  Long term, for the price and features, probably look elsewhere.  Not recommended."
0,"I understand why a 2 liter of coke is less than a six pack, the packing materials and such make the economy of scale such that it is cheaper to sell in volume.  But for downloading a program and turning it on or off via an automated software switch, there is no real reason to charge $10 a month more for a customer who is trying out, or occasionally using a program.<br /><br />Personally, I hate this subscription program.  It is like Adobe took all the worst aspects of APPS and combined them into their new model.<br /><br />For instance, many consumers are used to apps that update for free.  Adobe is claiming that is what they are doing.  Except the apps don't (typically) recur a charge each month and the prices aren't so steep as to send anyone but the richest of businesses running for a cheaper alternative.<br /><br />And Adobe has crippled programs like Elements and their other consumer versions of their products to the point that they won't do what the average person needs - i.e. Elements won't run PS actions.<br /><br />Hopefully someone is sitting in a seat being grilled for their foolish pricing scheme and hopefully it is costing Adobe an arm and a leg in lost sales and people stealing their software.  I would never condone that, but at what point are they just ripping people off instead of providing a quality product at a reasonable price and making a handsome profit - at what point do they say, &#34;Let them eat Corel&#34; to the point that the people revolt?  Hopefully soon!!!"

2,"Preferred 2011 version.  Had to update due to Quicken no longer supporting financial downloads for 2011.  Automatically creates Quicken investment tracking account that is updated with Intuit site during every financial activity download, that can't be turned off, even when I don't have any investments to track.  Always displays upcoming actions when a register is opened, reducing the register entries shown even when no actions are available to show.  Nothing to make worth upgrading from previous version other than you have to to continue downloading bank transactions into Quicken."
2,"I waited until this product had been out for many months before buying it, as I've been burned by Intuit before. The product appears stable, works, does the job, a couple of nice features have been added, some annoying bugs remain. I gave it 3 stars due to the company's attitude, which can happen when you're the only game in town. But at this point, the product works, and works fairly well. No major issues as of this date."
0,This tax program does not have the correct state information and did our tax return incorrectly.  The person I chatted with both on the phone and via computer appeared to not know the tax code.  I hung up in frustration and completed our tax returns manually.  Check carefully as they advised me to do.  Defeats the purpose of purchasing the program.  Beware.
2,Made doing my taxes easy but not sure it optimized my refund or in my case what I owed....

4,"I have been using McAfee Internet Security for a couple years, and had to restore my computer a few times because of attacks (through javascript).  McAfee never stopped them.  NORTON DOES.  McAfee also needed manual configuration to allow my typical services to work, such as syncing with a phone or with my Squeezebox server.  Norton doesn't require any manual settings, they are all automatic or are resolved with answering a simple pop up box.      I received a 60-day trial with my new laptop, and a 6-month subscription to some other brand.  After I saw how good the Norton/Symantec product stops attacks on my computer during the trial period, I bought it without question.  Scans only happen while not using the computer, and my computer is never slow when using it.      My only complaint is the nagging reminders several times a day when your subscription is a week away from expiry.  You can't turn them off.  In my opinion, it's like having one less week than what you bought.  Every time I try to close the window it takes me to the web for purchase.  They should have a \\""don't ask me again\\"" option.  Please fix this Symantec.  Otherwise, perfect."

The justice department calls that extortion.

0,"I don't trust this product. I didn't buy TTHB 2014 on Amazon --- I bought it directly from Intuit. I'm warning everyone as a good netizen that this product is horrible on the Mac --- it's painfully more sluggish than TurboTax Online. Worse, it hangs every time I open it and requires a &#34;force quit&#34; to make it stop. TurboTax support suggests some tricky system administration drilling down into the Preference folder to make the product quit, but their suggestions don't work. I've used TurboTax for about 6 years, but I would not recommend it now."

2,"If you think you might need to use a well-known CAD package in your future like AutoCAD or SolidWorks, I would recommend looking into those.  They have very steep learning curves and it is better to jump into them than to learn something different and have to un-learn what you know.<br /><br />I use this CAD package because it is much more compact than the big names.  It is also a fraction of the price.  I can draw lines, save them to a file, and print the drawings out so that the machine shop can fabricate my designs.  I mostly use the 2D capabilities of DesignCAD, manually creating views from various sides.  For my purposes, it does what I need.<br /><br />It can be a little glitchy when it comes to panning around your drawing.  Sometimes the screen just doesn't render correctly.

0,Bought version 12 in August of 2014.  This version came out December 2014.  I think it is bad policy not to offer a free upgrade to this product considering the short amount of time.  The product is fine and I've used it but I will not be buying this software again.  I'll stick to adobe and sony as my main editing software.
4,"As I recall, Quicken had its beginnings in a product called &#34;Electric Checkbook&#34; in the early 80's. Since then it has continued to develop into a full-fledged financial manager which is indispensable for wealth management, monitoring, control, and taxes. We use it every morning to download the latest financial transactions making financial tasks much less time consuming and tedious. Great software and easy to use."
2,I liked Quicken 2010 much better.  But then I liked every previous version better than the next.  I had to update in order to download financial data because that's the was Intuit forces its customers to but the new product.  The only new feature I like better than in Quicken 2010 is the form of the downloaded financial data.  Otherwise every other update is worse that what it improved.
4,"I've tried many free (and paid) antivirus/antimalware programs over the years and still do, including testing them with \\""live\\"" malware samples.The Avast is the ONLY one (out of all legally free antimalware programs) which consistently finds most of the malware (some of which being \\""missed\\"" even by some paid programs) with very little system impact or user intervention. Recently there has been some \\""issues\\"" with price-comparison browser extension which Avast has been installing by default with this antivirus, but they have removed this extension (it is now available as separate download) and you can ALWAYS skip installation of such extra unwanted components/tools/extensions - all you need is to chose \\""Custom Install\\"" option and uncheck everything under \\""Tools\\"" section during the installation of this version.<br /><br />Also, there are many \\""hidden\\"" settings which are not enabled by default but which can improve the detection of certain unwanted programs (for example, you can enable \\""scan for potentially unwanted programs\\"" as well as increase \\""Heuristics sensitivity\\"" for each component under \\""Active Protection\\"" section to increase the detection rates) as well as reduce performance impact of this program on your PC (if you have an extremely old, slow PC) so don't be too lazy to spend a few minutes and going over all of these settings after the installation ;-)<br /><br />And remember - you don't NEED to supply your real e-mail address during the \\""registration\\"" process (which you will do after installation of this product), you can type whatever address you want to (you're not buying anything so you don't NEED to receive any e-mail from Avast), the free version of Avast will register perfectly with it and won't bother you for a year after this registration ;-)"
3,"Avast has served me very well with only 1 exception.  Before 2014, I had bsods caused by avast updates which were resolved by uninstalling/reinstalling but this seems to have been limited to last version as I had no trouble before or after.  Avast has helped keep my and my family's computers safe for 5 plus years.  Easy to use, non-intrusive, maintains pc performance better than paid suites Ive used. Im a big fan.  Thanks Avast."
1,"I bought Quicken 2013 because I thought the app would be useful since I carry a tablet most of the time now. Unfortunately, the app doesn't display any investment information. I don't really need to see my bank balance away from my PC. You also need to send the data to the Quicken cloud service to access them and, while I'm not all that worried about it, the risk of a security breech isn't zero. Even if small, to me, it isn't worth any risk for the functionality offered.<br /><br />The desktop version is petty much the same as it always is. I upgraded from 2011 and it feels very comfortable.<br /><br />I'm giving it two stars because the desktop version is adequate. It probably deserves three stars, but my disappointment in the app is making me biased against it. I definitely don't feel good about buying Quicken this year and I wish there was a better alternative."
1,"So far I haven't found anything worth paying for in this \\""upgrade\\"".<br />*Still doesn't handle farm as a business (it is), just as 2013 and previous didn't. Business reports don't work because of this.<br />*When I am entering a transaction and alt-tab to email or browser to get info to enter, when I alt-tab back, it has lost focus on the transaction. Used to work fine. I do this all the time - major pain now.<br />*Control-N doesn't start a new transaction anymore.<br />*I can't alt-down arrow in the date field of a transaction to open the calendar anymore. Have to click the calendar.<br />*When working in a register, the main Quicken window grays out. You have to click it before keyboard commands (such as Ctrl-B for backup) will work. I can't just finish my work and then Ctrl-B to backup anymore.<br />*I do like the new icons left of the transactions, but they aren't worth the cost of the software.<br />I can only hope there is something else good in this version. The mobile things are of no use to me. I don't want my financial info leaving the house on portable devices. Huge security risk there."
0,"Lost complete hope in this product. I got 3 yrs back and was not satisfied with the product. sales rep told that they have improved their product, but PC is slow and attacks of malware is easy. Will never buy this product in future."
4,"I am very satisfied with the product in that does what I want and need.  I use this for my checking account, credit card, loans and investments.  I only use the product in manual mode, that is I don't download the info from my bank.  Also, Amazon had a great price."
3,"First, I want to say that this product is absolutely wonderful.  I'm really happy that I purchased it.  With that being said, please understand that it took a few hours for the link to arrive to my e-mail.  Also, you have to setup an account with Microsoft before you can download the product.  Also, you may not use your Amazon credit card to pay.  It will automatically be billed to whatever &#34;other&#34; credit card you have on file.  Lastly, there is no refund.  At least, that's what I was told when I realized my personal card was charged.  At the end of the day,  I'm glad I got the product.  It's awesome."
3,This product seems to work as well as past versions.  No problem installing or bringing my files into play.
2,"It is unreasonable to let the software can be installed only once. If there is something wrong with one's computer, he reinstall the windows system and he have to pay this software again in this expensive price. Microsoft, go and eat s***."

0,Do not buy this for the epublisher. It is pure junk. It will not publish to .mobi ( necessary for Amazon ebook publishing ) and it wipes out your work and it is not recoverable. The word portion works well.
0,"I ordered the TurboTax (Premier) because my old favorite version of TurboTax (Deluxe) has been downgraded (no longer supports Schedule D). I did purchase the Premier version because in the past (since 1998) TT has done a great job of doing my taxes. I rated Premier a one star because of the way I was forced to update too receive the same functional result I receive in a lower version in the past. If I had not seen the lower ratings I would have purchased the incorrect version and then I would have been very upset. I did pay more for the Premier version this year, but next year I will not be using TurboTax again. I hate doing this, but I will make the change. If Intuit wanted to be consistent in the desktop and online versions, then why not upgrade the online version instead of downgrading the desktop version, that would have generated a lot of good press instead of what I have been reading on the review sites.  I also purchased TaxAct and will be parallel testing too see if this will be my new go to tax program, who knows I may even file this year using it.."

2,The was a good price for the product but the download literally almost took a whole day.  So frustrating and time comsuming
2,"I updated my two year old Nuvi 660 with this update a month ago and paid lots more than this price.  I did it while connected to my PC with Win 7 Prof Ed.64 bit.  The update process is long and takes over 2 hours and ties up your PC, so do it at a time you are not needing your PC for a while.    The update makes your Garmin like new and has all the streets and places added to the maps over the time you owned your Garmin.  If your Garmin is old and you were thinking of replacing it with one around $150, buy new.  If your Garmin is pretty up to date as mine was (big screen, bluetooth, etc.) do the update.  The update will leave all your saved stuff alone and your settings, unless you say reset settings."
4,"I have used turbo tax for the last 4-5 years and it is very simple to use. even for a senior not into taxes.it is written in senior friendly fashion, I highly recommend this product! as it has saved me $600.00 per year as that was what I was paying an accountant to prepare my annual taxes"

0,"This is my second product review, the first one was not approved by Amazon and even though I followed their guideline I have no clue why the review was denied. I guess it was some Amazon censorship issue that I'm not aware off.<br /><br />I purchased Elements on June 21st as a download. I followed all the download instructions but I've been having major issues.<br /><br />The end result means I can't use Elements. Since June 21st I've being trying unsuccessfully to ask for help via the Adobe online customer service. I've spent the best part of 7 hours over the past days trying to make contact with them and his has proven to be unsuccessful. It would be helpful if Adobe actually gave a wait time. Because once you sign on you have no clue when and if a customer service agent will contact you.<br /><br />When you tire of waiting and end your chat and then log back in later you ask the same question again and then wait for a response while looking a blank screen.<br /><br />I am now at the stage of giving up and wanting a refund, which as I've downloaded Elements via Amazon does not seem possible. I've seem to have wasted $80 on a product that I can't use nor obtain help from Adobe customer service to resolve. My review would be zero stars but it's  not possible to do this.<br /><br />Amazon are normally the very best in customer service and they are always my go to purchase provider, but in this case they also do not appear to be able to resolve this for me either. Overall extremely disappointed and the Adobe customer service are out of their &#34;Element&#34;."

1,I tried H&R Block and I think it did a good job but... I liked Turbo Tax better.<br />Both packages work fine but I think Turbo Tax was easier and had better<br />instructions.
2,I've had previous versions of this software and I feel like the older ones were a bit more user friendly. Ultimately it got the job done (no pun intended) and I am left with a very satisfactory resume. Formatting looks very professional...Thanks to the developers..
1,"there is a distinct bug in the shareholders salaries area that has been on the user forums for over two weeks, but turbo tax has not fixed yet.  something like this happens every year.  many things work well, but you always need to override some stuff that just does not behave correctly.  relying on this program to get yours taxes correct is risky if you do not know the tax law on your own."
4,For many years I have used the free AVAST Antivirus and I never had any virus attack. Everything was discovered before it could do any damage
3,"Although this software has its drawbacks, it is superior to its competition. I have tried out three other residential CAD software programs, and this one has given me the results I need with the fewest headaches.<br /><br />I am working on two home renovation projects. The first one consists of converting a covered porch on the back of my house into an interior space. The second project consists of extending the slab of my house and adding an additional room. I need to submit drawings to the city planning department, showing both the existing and the proposed structures. I must supply both a floor plan and an elevation, that is, a 3-dimensional rendition of the proposed additions.<br /><br />All of the other software programs that I have tried can produce the floor plan, but they fail in producing the three-dimensional elevation drawing. Home Designer Suite is the only one that easily creates a printable 3-dimensional exterior rendition that can be shown to builders, architects, and city planning departments.<br /><br />The biggest drawback in this program is its difficulty in creating roofs. It wants to create roofs automatically, based on the type of walls you have specified. If your floor plan zigs and zags, it is nearly impossible to reproduce the roof line correctly. So I gave this program four rather than five stars.<br /><br />I must comment on the other reviewers who have complained about this program. All CAD software is time-consuming and requires substantial learning. If you spend time going through the tutorials, this program should work for most interior and exterior residential needs. Be sure to set up your defaults first."

3,"Easy to load, user friendly, and got a better rating than the McAfee software provided by HP."
0,"Couldn't use it with my Apple. My fault for ordering the wrong version, but I imagine it is the same as my comments regarding the deluxe version for the Mac."
0,It took 6-8 hours to install ( went to sleep) and I have the fastest internet service available. I then could not download my return from last year unless I paid an additional $74.99 for another version.
1,"Because the policy of Quicken to &#34;force&#34; upgrades after 3 years, I forced myself to upgrade from Quicken Premier 2011 that worked perfectly well to Quicken Premier 2014. Here are my findings during the upgrade:<br /><br />1. All the connections to financial institutions were converted incorrectly... I spent a good hour figuring out what was going on and having to re-enter or reset each account credentials. Also, during this process, Quicken crashed once and I had to restart and revalidate the accounts I had setup priory<br /> 2. The rest of the conversions went just fine and nothing else was lost<br /><br />But the real problem is that Quicken 2014 is significantly slower than Quicken 2011 and very often &#34;pauses&#34; and displays a round blinking/rotating (yes both blinking and rotating) pointer in the screen. The most noticeable and irritating place is when accepting a downloaded transaction in a bank account. It takes about 6 sec. between clicking on the &#34;accept&#34; button and the pointer stopping blinking and I'm allowed to move to the next transaction. This is very perplexing because I didn't had this problem with Quicken 2011 and I have a very powerful system (Intel Core i7 with 4 cores, 8 GB of fast memory, a very fast SSD and a very fast AMD Radeon graphic card). These &#34;pauses&#34; really give you a feeling that the software has a problem and can not keep up with managing the financial data and, considering that I use Quicken to manage all my finances, I'm getting very nervous... Going to have to increase backups...<br /><br />All considered, it is my opinion that this software is not going in the right direction and that the value is not there anymore. More aggravating, the actual performances and reliability seems to be regressing. Unless forced, I will not recommend upgrading."
1,"Cute program. Works nicely for floor plans. Forget it if you are looking for a home design program. No exterior details, roof layouts,or deck planning. Wish I could get my money back. :("
3,Have been using this program for many years.  It imports data from previous years and like the electronic filing. Very satisfied with it.
1,I read the reviews too late to affect my purchase.  I needed a MAC-compatible version and there is no way to return this to it owners!  Not a lot of width to its capacity.
3,"Product seems to work very well. Occasionally, for some reason I do not understand, it becomes disabled. Otherwise, virus protection functions well.  Recommended."
1,"I've been using TT for over a decade now. I used to love it, but I've noticed over the years that it has gotten worse and worse in terms of its usability. This year (tax year 2014) take the cake. I have never been more confused by a piece of software, much less one I've been using every year for over a decade. It led me down extremely confusing paths, which in the end were wrong, and cost me significant time and effort, and huge risk if I hadn't persevered through.<br /><br />What a disappointment to see a product devolve and get worse, when it should be getting better and better. Just look at the forums, filled with confused customers. It makes me wonder if the product quality was neglected, in order to get business elsewhere.<br /><br />In any event, I will be looking for alternative solutions next year. I've been loyal for so long, but it just keeps getting more and more confusing every year."
1,"I would like to get a refund. Except that refund site doesn't seem to work. The 2014 works like the other versions I have had of Quicken, which I would say is great!  However, the 2014 version as bugs in it that cause it to crash and Intuit doesn't not yet know why are what to do to fix it.  It should never have been release.  I am back to using the 2013 version of  Quicken and am very happy with it.  I just wish Intuit for fix it or give me a full refund for it."

Call Customer support who told me gaming dept. would call me but never received a call or refund.  Very irritating to buy a piece of software that won't even run.<br /><br />Further research shows that the software company site says OS is Win 7 (no mention of Win 8) However the Amazon site lists Win 7 AND 8 as a system requirement. This appears to be case of misrepresentation on the part of Amazon. Lots of wasted time for a $35 purchase."
0,office I hated this product I tried to download would not download and now it is saying it is used not happy
1,"This is a good product but it kept freezing my computer.  I liked everything it said it would do, just don;t feel I need to purchase new antivirus software to be able to use this product. Good product, just did not work for me."
0,"Given that Amazon is such a leader in cloud services, the Amazon Cloud Drive Desktop app is shockingly weak. Rather than follow the lead of Google Drive or Drop Box (et al), and simply make the cloud drive visible via familiar desktop file navigation tools, Amazon has come up with this short bus solution.<br /><br />All they're giving you here is a dumb, drag-and-drop uploader. Any further manipulation of your files in the cloud drive have to be done through the clunky web interface, which is EXTREMELY tedious to use.<br /><br />It's astonishing to me that Amazon would create such a poor product. It's not like cloud drives are new. There are plenty of examples out there of cloud drives that get it right. Amazon could easily make a cloud service that blows the doors off of Google, DropBox, etc. Instead they give us this.<br /><br />Consider me puzzled."
4,"I have used Turbo Tax for about 5 years, through all typed of family and financial issues.  Turbo Tax is a great way to do your own taxes and file for returns."
4,"Its the only antivirus I trust, I have never had a problem with it in the last 6 years that I have been using it. I always install this on all of my friends and families computers when they need antivirus and I always recommend it to those friends that already have antivirus."
2,"I just updated it since Intuit no longer supported my older version with bank downloads.  I see no advantages in it over my older version other than it allows me to continue to download my bank statements.  If I were purchasing it for the first time I'd give it 4 stars, but as an update, it does nothing more than give Intuit more money to allow me to keep doing what I'm doing."
0,"I did not find it user friendly and it took hours to download.  Even though it is on my computer, I will probably never use it."
4,"I see no issues yet and certainly not expecting to see any in the near future. As said, the price of the product is impressive and Amazon does a great job to get its customers the best possible prices. Happy with the product."
2,Seems to work great just as reviews in the past suggested would be the case. But I do wish it would reduce the number of times it wants to tell me about something else I could buy.
1,When I download new software and (there is nowhere else to obtain how it works) on the internet I expect instructions to come with it. There are none. Under the &#34;help&#34; tab there is nothing but an agreement! Very poorly done product.
3,"I have been using a spreadsheet to balance my money for years. I have used MSMoney, quicken, and quicken for Mac. This one is good. There are some small drawbacks. It takes a long time to download your transactions. I think this may have something to do with the fact that it goes through the Quicken server and you have to be signed in under you Quicken Id before it will log in to your accounts. That extra step seems to take time. I also don't like the savings over time and the income over time features, it does not work correctly. If you have a future income or future savings transaction but it is not actually mark as deposited into the account, the graph that shows your savings will be in the negative. With MSMoney back in the day the line for savings would keep climbing as long as you had future transactions on you sheet. This always prompted me to want to keep that line climbing, like a visual incentive. For the most part it is a decent product."
1,"terrible product. doesn't import all banking data from USAA nor TSP. I reached out to customer service to see if I could import my bank's CSV statements for the 9 months which were not included in the automatic transfer to Quicken, and Quicken stated I had to use the proprietary mint.com CSV... so I logged into mint.com, updated my banking account, and the banking data downloaded in mint was also incomplete. Since I am using this to prepare taxes, there is no use to the program if you cannot import the transaction history for the full year."
0,"Could not handle more then just a few rental units. With 121 units, it was so slow as to be impossible to use."
4,"Did what I need it to do, plus a real good price as well."
2,"The biggest weakness with Norton Internet Security was it's failure to catch annoying spyware. When I installed this version, it promised to look for those. We shall see."
3,"The layout of the software is a bit confusing and it doesn't help that there are a lot of recommendations that Turbotax wants you to buy, which after going to the state website I find out I don't need.  I don't like the way the program handles schedule K-1s.  If you have income in different boxes on the K-1 it doesn't allow you to enter them on the same page.  This means for the same company it seemed like they wanted me to add two of them for me and two for my wife.<br /><br />Other than that it is a good program that I've used for the past two years.  My taxes are pretty complicated as I have rental income and three small LLCs to keep track of.  The software lets me do my own taxes and saves me from having to pay a CPA $600 to do the same thing."
1,"UPDATE (the original review, below, was written about a year ago) - I tried again to update the maps and again ran into all sorts of difficulties. The download didn't work the first time, too a LONG time when it finally worked and then wouldn't install for some unknown reason. Garmin tech support is disappointing. If I had it to do over again, I'd have spent the money on a newer model GPS.     The original review:     I like the lifetime update feature; that is a plus.     BUT, I was disappointed to find - during the download process - that my device is not able to contain the map for the entire nation. As a result, I had to select that portion of the nation where I drive most frequently. Now, my daughter cannot borrow the GPS for her next trip to California, those maps are no longer available in my GPS. (And, yes, I checked on both the Amazon site and Garmin's to see if my model was eligible for this update. It was.)    Had I known this upfront, I would have considered upgrading the GPS to a newer unit with the capacity to have maps for the entire country.     I really like our Garmin GPS. To have lost maps for parts of the country is disappointing."
2,"The program works great for completing your returns but there are some costs that are not openly advertised.  The first is the cost of downloading a second State return.  This is required if you file an out of state return.  That extra one costs over $40 which is almost twice what I had to pay for the software package initially.  Lastly as advertised, you can efile the federal return for free but it's gonna cost extra to efile the state returns.  Great interview and interface with financial institutions but hidden costs.  But for these I would have given it 5 stars."
2,Not real happy I had to go with Pro to get Media Center but it works beautifully. Like Windows 7 interface better but you know about old dogs and new tricks...
2,"I have been in touch with Auslogics Tech Support. They tell me that they are going to fix the problem with bad keys coming out of Amazon.com .  Not sure whose fault this was, but they say they are in touch with Amazon and are working on a fix. So, I upgraded my rating to 3 stars for now. If this problem is fixed I will change the rating  to 4."
4,"And I'm doing just fine.  Installation is easy, updates happen automatically, and there are few ads.  It's nice not to have to purchase additional software just to run my computer."
4,Catches much more than others I have.
1,"I have been using Quicken since Microsoft gave up on Money.  I went to Quicken in 2007, and it was not an improvement over Microsoft Money.  After doing two upgrades (the most recent forced by Quicken's decision to not support Quicken 2010, I can say that I have found only one thing better about the current version. I have set up my  most frequent accounts (check book, credit card, cash account) as icons on the top bar.  Big deal, that is the only thing better.<br /><br />On the negative side, it appears harder to set up ongoing bills, and the software added a bunch of account types to my standard accounts when I converted to the new version.  The iPhone app is just not user friendly, so I don't see myself using it.<br /><br />In general, Quicken is still not as good as Microsoft Money version from 1998, and the app is not ready for prime time."
2,I think this product is okay. I would recommend this to others if they want to apply text on photos.
2,"The earlier versions of this software were so much simpler. I know that all of these packages have gotten more complex but for me, simple is better. I like being able to use software without having to take classes on it first. That being said, from what I could figure out (and I'm just scratching the surface) it did work well for what I needed."
4,I use this software every year.  I use the import function to import last year's return and it saves me time.
1,"Bought this for both a Minnesota Trust and Minnesota Estate. Advertising states once you complete your Fed return you can purchase and download YOUR state - this is NOT TRUE. Forms can only be purchased for completing returns in certain states. They NEVER tell you this. All materials say to complete the Fed forms and then you can purchase and download YOUR state - it even says this within the product, right up until you find the list of available states and may or may not find yours! You only find out this AFTER you have completed the Fed return. It took 2 hours on the phone and multiple reps for them to &#34;research&#34; and confirm that Minnesota (form M2) is not a product they sell . This is flat out fraudulent. I would have purchased a different product had I known this."
4,Love Norton Security
2,had trouble getting it to work.  I had to uninstall it then reinstall it.
2,good
2,"Ok, don't use often."
3,"As usual, I like the way that TurboTax guides me through the whole process, directing me to the appropriate IRS documents if I want to read them. The questions and answers under \\""Help\\"" also provide information that I find very helpful especially when an answer is from a TurboTax expert. When I became a self-employed consultant, I had my taxes done by an accountant. It cost me hundreds of dollars and I think some of the deductions he took for me were not always appropriate. After two years of that, I am back to TurboTax where I can make my own decisions based on IRS publications and expert advice. I spend a lot less money and am more comfortable with the level of potential problems if I am audited.  I also tried H&R Block software a few years ago and found it to be less intuitive to use than TurboTax."
1,My settings do not keep for my bill pay and that is frustrating.
1,"I have used turbo tax for a number of years but this year I needed to amend my return and although the taxes had been accepted by the IRS turbo tax would not let me amend the return,  It stated that the tax had to be accepted by IRS before I could amend.  There was no way I could override this therefore I have been unable to amend the return."
2,I NEED to be able to post against an Accounts Receivable and an Accounts Payable in the same general ledger entry!  PeachTree allows you to do so...
1,"I read the complaints about installing, but I thought it wouldn't happen to me, because I didn't have a problem with Excel 2013. But I couldn't install Word 2013, so I called Microsoft Support. A technician took control of my computer for 30 minutes, then disappeared into the cloud, without having fixed the problem. I reinstalled the program on my own, and it worked for a day, until it stopped working whenever I opened the program. Could it be some conflict with Word 2007? I'm not going to uninstall 2007, since that works fine. Why can't Microsoft write a program that works on its own operating system? A mystery."
4,"I really like the program. Since I've down loaded the program, I designed my own business cards and brouchers. I have not had any problems with it at all. Thank you Microsoft."
2,"The download went fine but the install hung on checking the .NET version as mentioned by others here (I do PC support so disregarded their warnings as user errors.....sorry).  A phone call to Intuit, with a considerable wait to get to a human, resolved the issue straight away.    the link to the tool to fix this issue:    [...]    Under the blue box, click on the 'click here' to download the tool.  There are adequate directions for the rest.  Once downloaded, running the tool unstuck the install and all ran according to plan.      I have been using Quicken & TurboTax for years and have always been satisfied, so the 3 stars are just for this Amazon download/install process having issues."
0,"From Norton 360 I migrated to Kaspersky 2015 Pure 3.0. This is worst than a free AV you get. Spyware, malware, viruses always creep in to the system and such a F****ing pain to maintain. It doesn't do a sh-t. Did many changes in settings and it doesn't help.<br /><br />WHAT A JOKE!<br /><br />Tried to return and Amazon says not eligible. Shoppers, listen! Don't buy Kaspersky! It is absolutely a worthless piece of sh-t!"
1,"Like many others users, I switched from PC to Mac and was looking for a replacement for Quicken.  I've been using iBank 4 for 5 months now, and I'm finally giving up on it.  The budget interface looks great, but it's clunky and not very granular.  Syncing it up with my bank, (Wells Fargo), always created duplicates or didn't download all transactions, which made reconciliation a tremendous pain.  The most infuriating part of iBank was the mobile app for iPhone.  It's down right theft on their part to charge for an application that is so useless.<br /><br />I'm now using YNAB 4 and I'm thrilled with it.  I think it's even better than Quicken in many ways.  The budgeting software within YNAB is second to none.  And the mobile app that comes with YNAB is phenomenal.  YNAB's major shortcoming is not being able to sync with the bank.  But a simple download and import does the job for me."
2,Challenging to use.
3,"For the most part Quicken 2015 is great.  My main complaints are that the Quicken servers seem to have constant problems connecting to my financial institutions, and it takes several days for them to get those connections resolved.  This is very inconvenient when trying to make a financial decision on a short timeline.  My other complaint is that the Quicken mobile app is not available for my Windows phone,  so I cannot access my data when I am away from home."
3,Having used Turbo Tax for many years I decided to try H&R Block after the price increases and poor communication of software changes at TT. I was pleased with the performance of H&R Block's software. It pulled all of the necessary data from last year's return flawlessly. I only gave it 4 stars because of the learning curve and I feel the navigation between forms and formats was awkward at times.
4,"Love these programs! Very easy to use. Photoshop Elements has a quick, guided or expert setting to help you get the best out of your photos. There are still a lot of features that I'm trying to learn so even though this is somewhat of a basic Photoshop program, it is still loaded with helpful features for the amateur photographer."
1,don't remember what this is........ oh well.
0,"This program is an strip down version but does not allow you to see transactions from your financial institutions, therefore useless.<br />I was slow to reach on the 60 days so now I own it. What a waste of my money..."
4,a great product that works well and gives me peace of mind--as long as you keep it updated like your supposed to and scan once a week with it!!.
4,great looks and functionality.  much more functional than similar products I have bought in the past that because of the design i have lost.
4,Never a problem using TurboTax.  Great way to complete your taxes.
1,It's a real memory hog.  Too many features and not enough time to figure out how they work and how they benefit me.
1,"I bought this product because the old version didn't work on my new computer. I am very disappointed. First, the program is designed to work through my bank. I don't need that. I just wanted something to keep track of my checking account and help me balance at the end of the month. I finally figured out how to do that, but it wash't easy. There are no clear instructions. If, like other reviewers have said, I wanted to track stock, investments, planning, etc., I would be even more disappointed. Since I only need the basics, it works okay for me, but I can't recommend it."
4,I have been using this software for several years now (TaxCut & now HR Block). It is a very easy program to use for those with simple to medium types of returns.
0,Installs itself without consent through third party  programs and then puts viruses on your computer instead of protecting against them so that you pay more for the other packages
0,"Bye bye to Turbo Tax.  I have used this software for the past 13 years.  I have been<br />happy with TT Deluxe and never had a problem with it.  However, this year's version,<br />which has been watered down by the elimination of critical schedules is no longer<br />suitable for my needs.  However it is the manner in which Intuit has chosen to screw<br />its users by not alerting them loudly to that fact that has turned me now to H&R Block<br />Deluxe software.  Intuit has always had the rep of being sleazy marketers, but this<br />latest ripoff is the last straw.  Based on the H&R reviews, their software does the<br />job just fine at a huge cost savings over the TTPremier version.  Disguising a price<br />increase is the highest insult a company can pay to a loyal customer."
3,"I thought direct deposit was just that but later realized I need to approve each direct deposit at least two days before the actual deposit. Sometimes I am not in a location where it is convenient to notify on line, so the recipient does not get their payment on the date previously assigned."
1,I found the Turbo tax this year frustrating!  It didn't make sense to me to claim deductions and have your refund go down!!
4,What can I say?  It saves me a lot of money by finding all my qualified deductions without having to pay a CPA!
0,"The product downloaded, but I am unable to install. So I would like my money back."
2,"H&R Block seems to be ignorant about the 1,000,000 mortgage ceiling.  They do not offer worksheet and not responsible for audit help."
3,"I am a longtime user of MS Office and believe that Outlook is the absolute best application available for e-mail, scheduling, time management, etc.  Until I used the Office Suite on a Mac I did not realize just how good the program was."
0,"Quicken 2014 is a disaster.  I have been a loyal Quicken user for over 20 years (since Quicken for DOS) and their insensitivity to the user interface in this version is astounding and incomprehensible.  Quicken 2014 is riddled with functionality problems including data entry and online banking.  Things that used to be simple are now cumbersome.<br /><br />Sadly, Intuit seems to think customer satisfaction is achieved by posting replies that they will “pass this review to our development team for consideration in future product releases”  rather than actually fixing the problems they have created newer versions.  From my personal experience of contacting Intuit multiple times, and seeing what others have written–the bottom line is that Intuit seems not to care, nor do they listen in an effective way.<br /><br />As others have noted, their monopoly position both makes alternatives scarce, and seems to foster this attitude that Intuit does not need to care about their customer.  Sadly I think this situation may only change where there is a viable competitor forcing Intuit to be responsive, or hopefully a sea change within Intuit to decide to listen to customers.<br /><br />If you don’t have to upgrade–DON’T,  because it will only cause you frustration.  Unfortunately I have to use Quicken. I am going to try Quicken 2013 in the hope that it is only a partial disaster.  The situation is so bad that I am willing to re-enter several weeks worth of data manually from multiple bank accounts, since I upgraded to Q 2014–because Intuit makes sure that their products don’t have true compatibility between versions–another little gift from Intuit."
2,It was fine to use and covered everything I needed but it said I had 1 free state filing and it charged me to file with my state.
1,"I have mixed feelings.  I miss some of the old easy features.  I could reconcile everything with just two clicks , now I have to search and seek for freatures to get what I need.  No real instruction, just figure it out!  If I had not paid for the system I would return to the older system even though Quicken will nolonger support the older version.  What the hell do I need the sync for I do not do on phone banking, its just shoved down your throat.<br /><br />Buy at your own risk"
3,I have been using other versions of Paintshop Pro and know how to use a lot of the features.  There is still a lot I am learning.  It is<br />cheaper than the best and will do just about as much.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to improve pictures.
1,"I generally don't like Microsoft products, b/c just about the time I actually LEARN how to use one of the products, MS changes where all of the buttons and switches are.  Seriously, Microsoft ... stop changing everything in your software!  Improvements are fine ... but there is no need to move everything else around to do it.  (Have you finally go the message, now, with Windows Vista ... oops, I mean Windows 8?)<br /><br />The Office 365 product is OK ... I can use it on multiple devices ... but I just hate using MS programs, anyway.  And I don't like MS being able to keep such close &#34;track&#34; of me ... and such tight control ... of their products, through the internet.<br /><br />I suppose the advantage of having the &#34;latest version&#34; of these products is that ...well, you have the latest version, and it SHOULD be compatible ... and backwards compatible, with previous versions.  And the clear disadvantage, at least in my mind, is that the programs that you once knew how to use ... will change.  MS has been singly responsible for a substantial decrease in my personal productivity.<br /><br />With this type of software, at least through MS, you can expect that the second your subscription has expired, you'll no longer get to use your software, with out pulling your credit card out, again.<br /><br />When your subscription expires, you WILL be able to view your documents ... but will NOT be able to change them in any way.  So I feel &#34;held hostage&#34; by Microsoft.  And I am using more and more frequently the Open Office suite, which I prefer on most occasions."
2,"Everything was going great until Quickbooks decided it wasn't properly registered.  It asked me to call an 800 number.  I go through the prompts and then I'm told I'll be transferred to a representative.  I'm then told their closed.  A Saturday afternoon and my business is shut down because I was foolish enough to install a product that 1) decides it's not registered as though that should make a difference with my valid purchased from Amazon key and 2) Doesn't have anybody on the phones on a Saturday afternoon.<br /><br />I'm going with Gnucash next time.  It's free and you won't have to deal with these lazy people any more.  $140 for nothing.  Thanks Intuit!<br /><br />Update:  I tried looking up the number instead of the one Quickbooks gave me and got a human being who could help.  I've revised my review, but I still think this is a serious issue."
3,"Great program, some features do not work perfect on my Encore Write tablet but over all it's a pretty good program."
2,"Download was easy and fast. Software is easy to navigate. Only problem I ran into was in writing checks: the software alternated between calling the checks payments and deposits, even though I wrote them all as payments."
1,"I've used Turbotax for MANY years but this year may be my last. I inadvertently hit the wrong checkbox and TurboTax told me I needed Home & Business and could upgrade for free. I upgraded but then after starting with the new software realized I did not need Home & Business and it was far more complicated to use so I decided to downgrade back to deluxe. I thought this would be a simple matter of uninstalling and reinstalling the software. Each time I attempted this the reinstall reverted back to Home & Business. Finally after searching on TurboTax's website I found a solution that involved manually uninstalling the software and deleting directories. I started my return and made it all the way to the state portion and attempted to download my state. This was a big headache as each time I tried to download it the software would tell me I was up to date but would not download my state software. Again I turned to TurboTax's website and found this is a known bug when you upgrade your software from one version to another. They created a tool to fix this issue and after running it I was able to download my state and finish my return.    Intuit & TurboTax - for as many people as you have that use your software, you NEED to make sure it works, and works well. It's slipshod design when your uninstall doesn't really uninstall but basically leaves all the files on my hard-drive and just deletes the shortcut. Based on the poor design of your program this year and all the other headaches of moving features from one version to another I believe next year I'll turn to another tax software to file my returns. You'll have to win my business back by being the outstanding tax software on the market, not the lackluster, \\""we take our market base for granted\\"" product you have created this year."
0,YOU CANNOT COPY AND PASTE TEXT FROM THIS BOOK WHICH IS THE REASON I PURCHASED IT. ALSO IT APPEARS I CANNOT RETURN IT OR CANCEL THE ORDER WHICH HAS ME PRETTY PISSED OFF.
0,"Unable to handle schedule K-1 properly, software has nasty bugs which corrupted my data - (1) in Rentals and Royalties section, after I entered the data for schedule K-1, the data in rental properties section was corrupted!  resulted in a unrealistic big loss there, therefore rendered the return totally useless. I also tried to delete the corrupted items but the software won't allow it (no response after I clicked on Delete).  (2) the design of the bona fide residence test was boneheaded, once you click any two of the options on that page, there's no way you can come back and try the other (physical presence) test (see the attached screen capture)."
4,Great product at a great price.
4,I've used this tax software for a number of years and prefer it over Turbotax
0,"Bought the student version in October 2014. It didn't work on my pc so I wasn't able to use it. Recently I bought an iMac and now I want to download the Mac version but Amazon won't let me. Amazon won't let me change the platform!!! Wow, so disappointed in Amazon, what kind of service is this? Corel won't help me either because it's bought through Amazon, they say I should be able to download the Mac version from Amazon, and Amazon is referring back to Corel. Great service from both Corel and Amazon......."
4,"H&R Block @ Home Deluxe + State [Download] is just what you need to make tax-filing simple and pain-free. I have been using the H&R software(formerly TaxCut) since 2003 and have never had a problem. Best of all you can import last years' info directly into your return saving you time. I have many deductions and this software helps compute everything and also makes e-filing a cinch, thus getting my return back faster! The Download was smoooooth, and is such a plus+++ not having to deal with bulking packaging, shipping, or CD's."
3,"Works well ... I only started recently with Quick ... need profit and loss report so moved up to 2013, Home and Business. Nice product. Nice service to get it to me quicly."
0,I thought I bought the anti virus Fml.
1,Purchased a Nook tablet and wanted to have all of my Quicken(Q)information on my laptop also appear on the tablet. Q13 installed without a hitch and syncs very well. What I do not especially like and regard as a design flaw is the format of the check register on the tablet which does not resemble the laptop check register window format at all. Would probably have stuck with my older version of Q had I known of this significant flaw. I am long time user of Q and will continue to be but no more upgrading only to find out it to be actually a downgrade.
0,"I bought this Pro version software because it said it creates STL files for my 3D printer.  Big mistake!  Spent hours trying to design a little box with two cutouts.  Impossible to make box inside another box and create them with parallel sides.  Also could not place cutouts where needed.  The documentation doesn’t match product, it says one thing and software ignores it or does something else.<br />When you buy through Amazon you don’t get an order number recognized by the seller.  If you can find their telephone number the message is ‘High volume of calls’ which in my mind means either everybody is having problems with their software"
3,"My download installed just fine!  I was glad I didn't have any problems that I remember.<br />I rated the way I did because unfortunately I haven't even been able to use it yet.  :(  However, it's a good rating still, so my rating is just my unfortunate inexperience.  It downloaded with no problems so that is the sole reason for this good rating."
1,"After buying it and trying to do the free upgrade and failing, I went to TaxAct for free and came up with the exact same refund.  For Free!  Next year I will be smarter and do it all for free!"
0,"The first clue you shouldn't buy this program is when you see more 1 star reviews then 5. What more can I add about this program other then I've had numerous problems with downloads, `server error'; this program is just flawed. My biggest disappointment is that Quicken has pretty much cornered the market on personal finance software programs. I've even tried to find an old copy of Microsoft Money family budget software.  Quickens puts out a defective product and doesn't fix the bugs and doesn't provide competent tech support, then expects you to shell out your hard earn money.  So here's a tip to help you with your 2012 budget, don't buy Quicken 2012."
2,"The program did function once downloaded, but it was difficult to download.  I even wondered (and still wonder) whether it was a legitimate sale."
4,"sometimes, everything is a threat, but better safe than sorry. Well, I do feel safer than before i did not have it."
3,"I've always thought Norton products were excellent.  Norton 360 seems to be just as good, but I'm having some minor issues with it on my Windows 8 laptop."
0,This has been a waste of money. Don't buy this until you're sure you can make it work for you.
4,I have been using Quicken for many years. I think Quicken is the best and every year it gets better. I will never be with out Quicken.<br />Thanks Bill

1,"too many pop up pretend warnings in the right bottom corner, very annoying"
3,"Unlike versions back in the days of Windows 98, SE and Millennium this versions works really well and doesn't bog down your PC."
3,Avast! Free seems to work well but has too many adverts/popups to purchase.<br /><br />The following is entered because the polling site wold not accept my submission unless I entered &#34;more words&#34;.<br />Requiring &#34;more words&#34; in a descriptive text is beyond stupid on the part of the polling service!
0,Has pop ups that show up on every site you get on. You can not utilize the site until all the pop ups are on the screen.
0,"Removing schedule D and forcing me to use Premier is absurd!  I have used TurboTax for over 20 years, but have decided to switch to H & R Block because of Intuit's decision."
0,"This program didn't work with any of our accounts, so it was pretty much useless."
1,"This was the worst release to date for turbotax. From excluded forms to 7 days to fix the importing problem with its deductible. I also bought home and business version, same poor results. I will look at tax cut for next year. Been using turbos since 1995, this is a real disappointment."
3,"I like the fact that one you buy it, you can download it from Amazon with practically no problems. It installed with no hitches and so far, it performs quite well. I wish it had a .pdf to show how to use the software. Perhaps it does and I am not looking in the right area. Anyway, not shabby at all."
1,Crashes frequently.  Conatant crashes make this difficult to use with any consistency. Purchase knowing the shortcomings of the software. You've been warned.
4,"I have been using Quicken since 1992 and have entered data from as far back as 1982.  I don't ever remember being required to upgrade the version I was using, however, I do every few years, usually when I do a computer upgrade just to keep up with the latest options available.  Recently my six year old computer quit booting up with Windows Vista (yes, people had been recommending that I upgrade for awhile now but I wasn't having problems, so I didn't) but when this happened, the computer tech advising me, recommended upgrading to Windows 7, so I did.  He was able to save all of my data but not the programs on the computer, so I decided to go ahead and upgrade my Quicken to the latest version (I think I had been using Quicken 2009 previously).  Because I didn't have Quicken on my upgraded computer, I was unable (or didn't know how) to delete the password on my Quicken backup as recommended in several of the reviews but decided to go ahead and try the installation anyway.<br /><br />The price on Amazon was almost half of the price on the Intuit website, so I went with Amazon.  The download and installation went flawlessly (even though I am not currently living in the US, I do however, have a US billing address) and quickly.  My old password worked without any problem and when I was ready to load my data, the information was moved into the new version without any problems.  I may not be up on all the latest and greatest technology but I do have an accounting degree and I have always been very happy with the ability to track my personal finances with Quicken and the accuracy that I have found in the program.  I have also used Quickbooks from time to time in a professional capacity and have been happy with that product too."
0,Very sneaky approach to screwing faithful customers. Time to review H&R Block or others ... which I understand may be cheaper.
3,It helped my old laptop get back to normal.
4,I've used TurboTax for about ten years and it's always been reliable.  Updates are delivered online: very convenient.  Amazon premium shipping is also a welcome feature.
1,I was a victim of phishing and wasn't warned.
2,"After Purchasing 2015 from my old version 2012 I had some difficulty getting the files to convert.  I had to contact customer support for help.  The only way to communicate is by live chat.  Very unsat, I want to talk to a real person that can speak English. Not email's or live chat.  Enjoy the product and recommend it, but good customer service, they are lacking big time."
0,The product is terrible.  It crashes frequently during business hours causing losses and customer support is laughable.  Don't buy it!
2,"this is a 2 part review. The product itself is 5 stars but customer service and ease of renewing subscription is 1 star therefore 3 star review. Really quick product is awesome never really had issues, its easy to update and updates quite frequently. never gotten a virus while i've had kaspersky, 3 years running.<br /><br />Ok now for the bad. After trying to renew the license and adding the key code to my account it did not activate automatically and I waited a few days, still nothing. Tried calling the 866 number after trying to troubleshoot on their faq page. Nothing really there, there's about 6 questions on 4 tabs that they answer. I had to call the 866 number a few times to finally get someone that knew how to help me. The first call after being on hold for about 15 minutes just went dead and disconnected me. Next call I got a person after another 20 minute wait and after going back and forth they decided that they could not help me in regards to the key code and gave me another number for technical assistance this was about a 30 minute call. So I call tech assistance and wait another 20 minutes and get ahold of someone. after going back and forth he finally tells me that there is an issue that for some reason it does not allow it to automatically update even with the new key code. So I had to uninstall the program and get an email and reinstall it. then i had to update everything again, so in total I had to spend about 3 hours just to get it to work. previous renewals took about 5-10 minutes."
3,"had several problems downloading to 3 pcs, I contacted amazon as well as Norton for assistance and it was a renewal subscription,<br />probably will use another protective service next time"
3,"Quicken 2015, Update 2.4 seems to be working well for basic finances. It's evident the Intuit programmers are hard at work fixing a lot of issues that originally shipped with Quicken 2015. However, it is far from a \\""finished\\"" full product, as fundamental features of Quicken (Windows) remain missing, such as Bill Pay. Intuit needs to attain full feature parity between Quicken (Windows) and Quicken (OS/X, \\""Mac\\"") software platforms. There are positives: the new register layout is easier to read, and the dynamic graphing reports are helpful. Once Intuit gets the reporting features fully up to date, with Bill Pay support, Quicken 2015 will be very useful."
4,Really easy to download to your PC.  Make sure that remove/uninstall your current antivirus program before install a new one.
2,"I ordered this to do my taxes and this was the 1st year I was self-employed.  It did the job and I was able to get my taxes done; however, there were portions throughout that were not very self-explanantory and when using the help section it still did not really give me much information.  I still had to do alot of outside research.  But if you feel comfortable doing your taxes versus spending the money for an accountant - this will do the trick."
0,I downloaded this item on my computer and it crashed! Now it tells me that there is something wrong with my harddrive and I can't recover it. Don't try it. Find a more reputable site to buy it from and pay more money for it.
3,"With Windows 7 OS, it is not that heavy.  Not sure if all malware are found, but appears to find major ones."
4,Works on windows 10.
3,"I bought H&RB because I was disgusted with what Intuit did to TurboTax (Deluxe) this year -- which I had used for over 20 years.  Intuit admits the error of their ways, but it's too late.  I was pleasantly surprised and absent unforeseen changes will never go back to TurboTax.  The H&RB software is cheaper than TurboTax; it boots up 5 times faster; it opens a file 4 times faster; it has no shiny graphics to slow down the process or take up space on the hard drive (H&R is 2/3 the size of TurboTax); its update mechanism is far more efficient than TurboTax and totally transparent from a scheduling perspective; it is accurate and produces the forms flawlessly.  It also performs an e-file flawlessly.  The only con I can see is that it does not have a form which duplicates TurboTax's &#34;What-If&#34; form.  I would imagine that 99% of the users don't even use that form to forecast the next year or experiment with different elections in any year, but if you do use it, it's not there.  However, there is a workaround.  You can simply copy your return to a new file with a new name and play with it as if it was the next year.  All you have to do is manually change the exemption allowance and the standard deduction (if you use it to forecast a year other than the current year).  Both override changes are quick and easy.  If H&R had the &#34;What-If&#34; or something like it, I would give this 5 stars."
1,I am quite unhappy because can not use outlook...  The price was Ok but they did not say than outlook was not in the package...  I didnt like it!!!
0,"I only updated because I was forced; the license for downloading from banks, credit cards, etc., expired.  Otherwise, there is little difference in this product than with Quicken 2012.<br /><br />Be warned: this product has a glitch.  Back everything up before you install it.  If you have a password on your old files, the new version won't open them.  The only way to get the old files is to restore a back up version and remove the password.<br /><br />Frankly, if I had not been using Quicken for decades, I would switch to something new.  The only reason to by this is because of the expiration of the old license."
4,"A few years ago GPS's were becoming obsolete every year and with map updates $50-$100 it made more sense to get a unit on sale. Now you can keep your same unit and the interface you're used to while having the latest maps.<br /><br />I prefer a full-fledged GPS when going on trips because they seem to be more accurate than my phone GPS, a bigger screen and doesn't drain my phone battery in case of emergency. My garmin lead me the quickest way to Disney when my Google Maps app had me taking some weird back road. I'm no fan of back roads.<br /><br />It did take a few hours to update and the process on the website wasn't the most intuitive but I got there eventually. Set  it up, go watch a movie, have dinner and then come back; it should be done by then."
1,"They push Google Chrome constantly and try to slip it in every update.  I am really tired of it!  If I wanted Google Chrome, I would get it myself.  I will be looking for another security software when it is time to renew so I don't have to keep dealing with this."
4,I've tried them all but Avast turns out to be the best. Runs seamless in the background without being a resource hog. Caught alot of potential unsafe web sites along with viruses embedded in some files. Want the best then get the best. Avast!!!!! and all for free.
1,"I am a current Crashplan subscriber and I also use Dropbox free service with about 20gb of storage. They each have their own problems. Dropbox syncs all my devices and the cloud. Mobile devices are fine but when it comes to pc, when I delete a file from a sync-ed folder, that file immediately get deleted from the cloud also. I don't have that much storage space on my pc and want to backup it up to the cloud, unfortunately dropbox isn't a solution for that. if someone knows how to do it please let me know. I love dropbox, it is so easy to use, I would definitely pay for more storage if there is a way around it.<br /><br />As far as crashplan is concerned, I am using the most basic service which is the same price as Amazon cloud but it only works with one device. I like the way it works - you select which folder to backup, then it will run in the background. You can also select if you want to keep the file on the cloud when you delete it from your pc. However, the individual plan is for 1 computer, if you want multiple computers, you will need the more expensive plan and you still can't backup photos/videos on your mobile device.<br /><br />so when Amazon release it's cloud drive, it is very appealing to me - 1) low cost ($59.99/year) ; 2) unlimited storage; 3) backup multiple computers and mobile devices; 4) able to keep files on the cloud even I remove it from my pc. So I decided to give it a try and activated my 3 months trial.<br /><br />After using it for 1 day, here is what I think<br />Pros:<br />- some reviews complain about not able to rename or organize folder or select an entire folder, it is not true. Via the web interface, I am able to rename a folder, move an entire folder and delete an entire folder. I don't expect I can do all those on the mobile app.<br />- setup on mobile device is easy<br /><br />Cons:<br />- on the web interface, there is no refresh button. after a file is removed, it is still there in the folder, I have to move to another folder,go back in to see that it's gone.<br />- it has no idea about your folder structure. e.g. I have &#34;Folder A&#34; -&#62; &#34;Subfolder B&#34; -&#62; &#34;File C&#34;, if you drag and drop &#34;Folder A&#34; to upload it, that's fine, it will keep the structure under &#34;All&#34;. However, if later on there is a &#34;File D&#34; under &#34;Subfolder B&#34; you want to backup and upload it by itself, it won't go under &#34;Subfolder B&#34; on the cloud, it would just go under &#34;All&#34; and you need to move it yourself.<br />- The mobile app is for photos and videos only. Does it have another app for other files? that's pretty stupid.<br />- it won't recognize your file is updated. Say you have a copy of your resume on the amazon cloud, you updated your local copy and want to back it up. sorry it won't let you. it will say &#34;This file/folder already exists&#34;. So you need to delete the file on the cloud first.<br />- Auto-upload option is limited. I want it to upload only when it is on wifi and plugged-in but there is no such option.<br />- the worst of all, like most reviewers have complained, there is no sync-ing. I cannot believe this is even a called a cloud service. I feel like I am using an ftp server back in the 2000. Do you know how inconvenient it is? every time I copy photos from my camera to my pc, I have to manually open the cloud desktop app, drag and drop the photos, and reorganize them back to the correct folder. Can you imagine how much labor is involved? When you can use robots in your warehouse to sort books and stuff, and build drones to deliver packages, why can't you develop a cloud service that can do auto upload in the background?<br /><br />I am seriously hoping this is a beta version of their service and they can address the issues we complained about. I have an upload going on while I am writing. I am still going to give it a try, at least within the 3 month trial period."
0,"I read a lot of good reviews about Bitdefender and was looking for something to replace my Avira installs. It installed easily and quickly, but I had problems with the vsserv.exe locked into running at 25% cpu usage. They have an article on their website that describes this problem and the solution is to turn it off and see if that fixes it. I'm not sure that I see the value in a product that requires it to NOT RUN. I opened a support ticket. Part of the support process involves running a diagnostic tool to submit information back. This tool pegged at 13% and never finished.  So their solution was to run the repair on it. It had only been installed for a few days, but I went ahead and ran the repair but that did nothing for it. So as a test, I installed it on another laptop as well. This one pegged a svchost process and the memory used jumped up well over a gig. I checked the services attached to the svchost.exe and of course it ended up being the Bitdefender causing it. This laptop also started locking up and freezing and it ran cleanly for years without doing that. So two different computers with the same shockingly poor results. I was really expecting a strong experience based on articles I read. I have since uninstalled and put on Malwarebytes and both computers are again running flawlessly. I wish I knew what the issue was because I lost a lot of hours trying to get it working on both machines. But unfortunately, I am just glad to have it removed and have them running cleanly with a different product."
2,"This was my first year using TurboTax, so I had a bit of a learning curve to overcome. I liked the real-time amounts showing how much my tax refund will be while inputting numbers.<br />I double checked my paperwork against last year, done by an accountant, and noticed that my royalties income is shown in Schedule C. When I forced it to Schedule E, where it should be, my refund increased significantly. If I hadn't caught it, doing my taxes myself would have cost me a lot of money, although I would have never known.<br />A big turnoff was that I had to jump through hoops to stay off the Intuit marketing machine, which involved visiting a website, inputting personal information, and stating my preference about not being marketed to by anyone. Similar to a credit card company privacy procedure, except in this case I just bought one product from this company, and they are trying to stick to me like gum to a shoe.<br />Finally, I was lead to believe that e-filing was free, only to find out the last few clicks that the State return is $20 to e-file. I suppose it was somewhere in the fine print, but I never saw it coming.<br />I am uneasy about a company that has some of my most sensitive information behaving in such sneaky ways."
2,"Previous user, would not use anything else."
3,It does the work.
0,This is useless. What good is unlimited photo storage if you can't Sync a folder. I guess I'll stick to Dropbox.
2,Wasn't able to send my electronic payment.  No one to help adjust problem.
3,Not the most intuitive interface but it worked for me and was cheaper than purchasing it from the store or the H&R website.
1,"This is the second year I have used Norton 360, and the product seems to protect and maintain my PC in so many ways. Besides virus scans, it optimizes the disk, cleans out all my temp files, runs a thorough diagnostic report, and reviews my startup programs, plus more.<br />HOWEVER, the download came with very troublesome malware, namely isearch.com/fantasticgames/465. This opened up everytime I went online and also appeared every time I opened a new tab. I followed instructions to remove the malware and reinstate my default homepage, but this did not work. I contacted Norton tech support. The first tech spent about 45 minutes trying to fix the problem and remove isearch from my registry. We thought the problem was finally solved, but the next time I started my computer, isearch reappeared on every tab I opened. Finally, I got another tech who spent about 30 minutes removing isearch and, knock on wood, the problem is solved.<br />I have always had such good experiences with Amazon and felt it was so dependable, but this was a major nightmare.<br />Hopefully, now that the malware has finally been removed, Norton 360 will be the dependable product it was the last time I purchased it."
0,It has become crystal clear that Intuit has no interest in providing Quicken for Mac in the future.  This seems to be their final stripped down version.  Nothing like the former versions I have used for 18 years.  I'm finally going to have to switch to another product.
3,So far so good.  I don't want to rate a 5 yet because I haven't used it enough. I will say I made it through making a compilation of videos.
4,"I have tried other software - PC Matic is simply the BEST - it WORKS,  My three laptops run just like new.<br /><br />Gary"
0,"I bought this product based on the good reviews...for the PC download version.  I didn't notice the sharp drop off in ratings for the Mac Version.  Bottom line - it will download but not install.  I read another review that said the company sent them the CD for free.  Not in my experience.  I called the help line, and they directed me to an online help ticket generator.  The help ticket said if you don't hear back after 48 hours, you should call this number.  After waiting for three days, I called them.  It has now been over a week, and they have not acted on the help ticket, or returned any of the five messages I left.  Of course Amazon will not reimburse you for digital downloads.  This company is terrible.  Please spend your money elsewhere."
0,"This is worthless backup software.  It backs up a file one time, but as that file is modified, it simply retains the original copy it made of that file.  After seeing how worthless this is as a backup tool, I bought Rebit 6 and it seems to have been working for the past few months.  So I think it may be worth try Rebit 6 instead."
1,"I bought this as a download after my previous years subscription expired. I didn't realize that when it downloaded, it would delete the passwords stored in the manager. What's the point of the manager if I have to write the passwords down as a back up -- double unsecure! In addtion, an extra password is now required to open something Norton calls a vault. The vault serves as a half-effective password manager. I say half-effective because it automatically creates a card whether I ask it to or not yet is disabled unless I enter my email and one of two passwords -- the Norton system password followed by the vault password. On top of that, no list of password cards is visible by activating the vault. You'd think this problem would be solved by another item in the toolbar called &#34;Login assistant.&#34; By the sound of this tool, it should show a list of available log-ins. Wrong. It either blinks when activated or, if you haven't entered your email and password, suggests that you do so in order to open the vault which doesn't contain a list of available log-ins. If this is a tedious and frustrating review to read then it just about covers how frustrating my transition to Norton 360 2013 was. I will not purchase as a download again. It would appear Norton has chosen not to import passwords from one Norton password manager to the next version of their own product."
0,"So I just ordered this software as a download from Spendmylikes.com.  With the promotion code, it was a little under $33.  Download processed and I am now updating from Intuit.  One wonders if this is an outlier or what will be a trend.  Since this is the only version that is not lamed, it has become the defacto basic and as such it will have to come down in price.<br />I like Turbotax more or less and think that it is more well thought out than the H&R Block product.  But I object to blatant money grubbing software laming.  At $33 I'm ok with having a functional product.  Perhaps Amazon will get new pricing shortly, but for now, take a look at spendmylikes.com."
3,"Seems like people either love or hate TT.  If you've used it for years like I have, it is so simple to move over your previous years return plus any accumulated capital losses that may go back a couple of years (a big plus for me).  I don't have a particularly complicated return - no partnerships or LLC's, just your basic income and expenses but TT has pointed out more than one deduction I would have missed on a manual basis.  And besides, who really wants to plow through the convoluted IRS forms!  As always, the early release is subject to numerous updates before it's complete so don't buy it early if you want to file and be done.  I like to get it as early as possible so I can do some year end tax planning based upon my overall tax picture and it's perfect for that.  I do wish they would start including a free state e-file in the deluxe fed + state version but good old Intuit loves to nickel and dime its customers to death and when you own the vast majority of the market you can get away with it, unfortunately."
1,"I have been using TurboTax since I was deployed as a service member -- it was easier to do my taxes online and I've stuck with them ever since...through many different complicated tax returns -- living overseas, military member, student, etc.  This year, my taxes were a little more complicated, but nothing that I thought the software couldn't handle.  The online version of the software, which was offered at a discount by my financial institution, suggested I buy the CD/download version because I was filing separately and it would be cheaper to prepare and file using this method than the online version.<br /><br />For my circumstances, the software was very confusing.  For instance, since we moved to a common property state -- the worksheet for this pretty much tells you to figure it out on your own using the IRS's website and my state's tax laws....which is more or less the whole reason why I chose to use TurboTax in the first place -- so I wouldn't have to navigate that big disaster.  Really disappointed this time around.  The fee schedule with this is so confusing, I'm still not sure how much I paid to complete prepare and file my return and my wife's return, including the price of the software itself... I'm thinking I was better off to just use the discounted online version that was provided by our financial institutions.<br /><br />Despite 12 or so years of happy use of TurboTax, I'm going to be filing with an accountant next year to avoid this mess.  I would have given it a 1 star rating, but with the Amazon Refund Bonus, I got it practically for free."
2,In order to upgrade the operating system to Maverick (on our desktop iMac ) it was necessary to upgrade the Quicken.  After reading all the bad reviews I was reluctant to do that.  I even tried the free help offered by some one that was listed in the links below the Quicken Listings.  This proved to be a vey bad mistake since they convinced me to upgrade to Maverick so they could walk me through the conversion.  However once I had done that they offered me the solution for $199.00.  I was livid and had no choice but to buy Quicken Essentials.  Part of my reluctance was the fact that Quicken does not appear to offer any customer support what so ever!<br /><br />Anyway I was able to down load Quicken Essentials and convert my files over to the new program and it appears to work well with Maverick.  The instalation of Maverick resolved some issues I was having with my Cable modem frequently dropping the internet connection.<br /><br />Back to the program.<br />It appears to work well for maintaining and balancing checking accounts.  It has some features I like and others that I miss. The inability to open two windows for two different accounts at the same time is one that I miss.  I do not use the on line banking functions or the investment tracking functions since I feel that there are much better apps provided by the bank and other financial institutions.<br /><br />It does ok for the basic functions and is compatible (can convert older quicken data) with older versions.<br /><br />I am also wondering what support if any is available when you download the program directly from Amazon.
3,"I didn't have any issues with the update like many of the other reviewers. A mostly seamless transfer of the old database and settings.  I haven't used the additional features (i.e., free credit score) and the interface largely looks unchanged since the 2012 version.  Software lost a star b/c I have to purchase the newest version every 3-years to keep updates active--hooray, I'm good until 2018!"
1,I found it not friendly. too much effort.  I use a &#34; Locked&#34;  document to list my PWs.
1,"This review will be short since most of the others have captured my feeling about Quicken 2013. I love Quicken, have been using it as long as I can remember.  However, I am not impressed with 2013.  Seems like the Quicken folks are just looking for something to call \\""New and Improved\\""  Don't bet excited about the mobile app, I am not sure what I expected, but a real letdown. I recommend if you already have a version of Quicken you just stay with it until their next \\""New and Improved\\"" version comes out. For me, I should have just stayed with my 2011 version."
0,"I've been using TaxCut for almost 10 years, this year the Business program can't even print.  From a web search this is a known issue but H&R block hasn't done a darn thing.  There is also no way to get support - the phone # and web pages all direct you to support for their paid preperation services, not the software.  Spend your money else where.  This fine program has been ruined since H&R Block bought it from Kiplinger."
3,As much as I depend on Norton....Avast is great!...for now I installed Avast protection less than 2 months ago...so far so good👍
3,"Upgraded from Quicken Premier 2012. Installation went smoothly and all my account information was converted successfully. I can connect and download everything, even from Wells Fargo (which has apparently caused some people problems). There doesn't seem to be a lot here that is new, but so far everything works just fine and it does seem to be faster than 2012."
4,"I am a CPA, and I have always used H&R Block S/W to process my personal return. I like that it is cheaper than TurboTax, and works just as well."
0,Terrible. I have been using Quicken a long time and in general (despite a lot of annoying bugs) it worked ok. I usually lagged behind a year in terms of upgrading because of how many bad reviews the new product always gets. So in 2014 I was using 2012 and in 2013 I was using 2011. This year I thought I'd be bold and went ahead and purchased 2015. What a mistake!!<br /><br />The program constantly freezes. I'm simply trying to add a brokerage account and some transactions MANUALLY. I'm not even trying to connect to online services. The stupid thing freezes every time I try to change the date of the transaction to anything other than today's date. Ridiculous!!<br /><br />I wish I had listened to all the other reviews about this product. Save your money and headache. Do NOT buy this. Besides I see no meaningful new features since Quicken 2013 anyway.
2,"I buy a Norton product each year.....sometimes I buy the disk and sometimes I download.  Either way, I find it hard to install....it usually takes an hour or so and sometimes I end up without protection.  The software should come with an automatic &#34;de-installer&#34; of current Norton protection to facilitate installation.<br /><br />The good thing about Norton is that you can always get assistance by the technical team.  Without that I would not have been able to get it installed and operating properly.<br /><br />The software works fine, however, I think I will go back to the Norton 360 product next time."
1,"Switched from a PC to aMac and this was not a smart purchase. First of all, had I been more patient with the transition, I would have realized the Mac programs (email, contacts, calendar, & Pages) are great. I finally quit using Outlook completely as neither my internet provider nor Apple support could fix the constant pop-ups telling me to re-enter my password. Think twice before you invest in this. For me it was a waste of money. Apple One-toOne training is the best and they will help you with the learning curve."
3,Installed in my daughters laptop with windows 8.1 after uninstalling software that I paid $30 for that completely disabled internet access. Seems to be working fine.
1,"I have mixed feelings about Quickbooks 2014 having just upgraded from 2011. On the one hand it does feel slicker and looks a lot neater, on the other hand it has some frustrating design flaws, mainly to do with organizing and resizing windows within the program. I could write a small essay about that. The new features are quite helpful though and all the information you need is right at your fingertips.<br /><br />But what I wanted to say in this review is that Intuit are a bunch of liars. They really are. Their sales reps will tell you anything to make a sale. Let me explain: with the end of my payroll subscription approaching, I was sent an email offer by Intuit to purchase Pro 2014 plus Enhanced Payroll for $499. Having a look around Amazon I found the offer you're looking at now, seemingly the same thing for only $279. So I called Intuit to ask a rep whether they were the same thing and if not, what the difference was.<br /><br />She told me in no uncertain terms that the email offer Intuit had sent me included a year's payroll subscription for unlimited employees, while the Amazon version carried an extra charge of $2/employee per month. Adding things up in my head it looked like the $499 offer would work out cheaper. I asked her if she was doubly sure of her claim. She reassured me that she was, but that she'd go away and ask her supervisor to make triply sure. After a short pause she came back and said yes, Intuit's email offer included payroll for unlimited employees at no extra cost. I almost bought the thing there and then, but something - perhaps all of my prior experience with Intuit - told me to go away and think about it.<br /><br />In the course of \\""thinking about it,\\"" I took a long hard look at the offer Intuit had emailed me. And there it was, in small print at the bottom: additional employees will be charged at $2/month. It was EXACTLY the same as the Amazon offer you're looking at, only it was $220 more expensive. The Intuit rep had lied through her teeth in order to coax me into spending close to 100% more than I needed to.<br /><br />But that's Intuit to a tee. Great software (when it works), but their customer service stinks to high heaven. When they're not lying through their teeth to you, they're giving you bad advice or misinforming you in a myriad of ways (while they pass you from department to department and accidentally \\""hang up\\"" on you multiple times during 2 hour support calls). Whomever is in charge of customer relations at Intuit needs to resign. They have absolutely no standards at all. So, for lying to me, you only get 2 stars."
4,"Exactly what you've come to expect from Turbo Tax.  Yes, some of the interface for the 'interview' portion has changed, but it's still just your taxes.  Turbo tax covers all the bases and gets it done."
2,"This is a fairly straightforward security application for novice users who do not want to fiddle much with settings. As an advanced user, I found the suite lacking. It is certainly 'passable' but it needs a bit more polish in my opinion."
4,Very friendly to use!
0,"I purchased this item , with a new lap top, from a local computer store early fall to use in my small home business. I installed it last fall on a laptop to be used for business purposes only. Have Mcafee anti virus, windows 8.1, used only for business - no surfing, no gaming, no social media, no deep, no dark, no dangerous sites. I used it for a small job in March, then opened office up a few days ago to do another very small project. Just saw an error message. could not access files at all.  (today, the files were there as explorer aps and, well...???)  I called Microsoft support and talked to a lovely and very helpful charming gentleman. He told me my warranty was up and it would cost $149,00 to extend it for a year. or he could do a one time fix for $99. This is after we tried the usual remedies contained within the program and they did not work. This program would cost well over $300 to use, so the $99/ year is probably the way to go, even if 1 person/1 computer is the case. On the basis of my experience, I would say to anyone planning on purchasing this to find a very secure alternative place to backup your files. This program is unstable, unpredictable, and unreliable, that is my experience, of  course.  YMMV. I hope it does. Good luck and all the best!"
3,Works great for my needs. Good software
4,I have used PC Matic for over 1 year and  it works great for me. No issues!!
1,"I'm about done with buying these.  I use this for business accounting and keeping track of accounting.  It does &#34;OK&#34;, but many banks are now charging users $12-15 per month for Direct Connect.  This to me is ludicrous.  I'll move to the online version at the end of this year and pay the extra.  Thanks but this is software probably won't be around later."

He is completely outmatchedd and outwitted by any other attorney, and he is in WAY over his head. If you abide by his book, you will reap the benefit of &#34;giving up the farm, &#34; so to say. Ron is a completely incompetent, worthless weak-minded guy. I would recommend his book and his logic to my ex-wife, so I could reap the benefits of life thereafter. Ron Ousky is a loser...through and through...Don't buy into this crap..."
4,It's amazing and user friendly.
4,I have always done my taxes myself except one year I paid to have them done. I realized then that I could have &#34;bought&#34; the TurboTax for what I paid. With TurboTax you can sit home and the program will guide you through the tax forms one step at a time until done and then file online. How do you not love it?
1,"I was forced to buy this version since Quicken refused to download transaction after April 30, 2015.  When I saw the poor rating online, I already had a bad feeling.  The biggest complaint I have is the 2015 version had had a hard time download the transactions from my institutions which is the main reason I paid $50 at Costco."
2,I purchased this and it was working for a while but then stopped working and my computer has been having problems every since. I always buy Norton Internet Security but this one is not up to par.
0,Does not print where it is suppose to print on envelope<br />Would not recomend it for others since it does not line up well
2,This is a good if complicated product.  I'm glad I'm taking s digital photography course - otherwise I'd be somewhat confused.
3,"Elements 11 is a photo editing program that can be used by all levels of digital photographers. It has the option for full automatic corrections, or allows for control of many individual editing tools. Worth the money!"
3,A welcome and efficient alternative to Microsoft Office Starter.
0,"I am a long-term user of TurboTax Deluxe who is infuriated by Intuit's money-grabbing ways and even more insulted and angry about Intuit's backhanded non-apologies. Not all small businesses are created equal. And why exactly should those of us with micro businesses (Schedule C) or farms (Schedule F) have to shell out an extra $40 a year for the Home & Business version, when we've been just fine with the Deluxe version all this time? I liked the convenience of being able to e-file, but not *that* much. I still know how to file my taxes with paper and pencil!<br /><br />I *had* been planning to upgrade to Quicken 2015 after doing my taxes this year, but now? No way. Even though Intuit is now backpedaling and offering to upgrade Deluxe users for free this year, and to put the forms back into Deluxe next year, who's to say what will happen after that?<br /><br />I've been researching it online and have been very enlightened by some savvy reporting in Forbes magazine. &#34;Customers who pre-ordered the Deluxe version directly from Intuit before TurboTax was officially released, were actually sent a special version--if, when using the software, they got to the point where they needed an upgrade, it gave them that upgrade for free. If Intuit was ready to give those who pre-ordered a free upgrade, and is now ready to give those who call to complain one too, why did it make the change?&#34;<br /><br />Intuit claims that the changes were designed to make all of their products consistent across online and mobile platforms. As Janet Novack says in her article in Forbes, &#34;that begs the question of why the online and mobile versions were changed to begin with or why all versions weren't given *more* functionality so they would be the same.&#34;<br /><br />Forbes reported today that &#34;Intuit Cries Uncle, Will Reverse TurboTax Deluxe Changes&#34; but frankly it's too little, too late. Online reviews of Quicken 2015 and this current TurboTax Deluxe fiasco only show that Intuit is just milking us for more money and doesn't care about quality or customer service.<br /><br />As Maya Angelou says, &#34;When someone shows you who they are believe them; the first time.&#34; I believe Intuit has shown us who they are. And I'm out. Bye bye, Intuit!"
3,"So far I am pleased with the update, I do find when I download financial information from my bank that once the information is downloaded, to update the download to my accounts takes a long time even when I accept the downloads.  Is this a particular problem?"
1,"While all the marketing material says \\""One time purchase\\"", be aware that this requires the base City Navigator North America product. City Navigator is not included with all Garmin products (specifically the eTrex series), so you may need to purchase *both* the City Navigator AND the City Navigator Lifetime Map Update products."
4,"I've never had the inclination to do my own taxes before but due to the continuous escalation in tax preparing prices I decided to give it a try, especially since Turbo Tax walked me through every step and offered other help if needed. The additional prices that were needed are still cheaper than HR Block or other tax preparers. I haven't received my refund yet because it's still too early but Turbo Tax assured me I had no errors and guaranteed acceptance. Overall the process of using this software was easy, seamless, quite helpful and saved me money."
4,"If you have a small business then this product is extremely versatile, and it has been keeping my contracting business organized for many years."
3,"Honestly haven't used it much, but when I need it, it works great! Easy, intuitive and quick. Just the way it should be. The &#34;other brand&#34; requires a PhD to learn!"
0,"Please be warned that Elements 10 for Mac does not have the same features as the Windows Version.  Although it works on Mac, it is clunky and lack features in the Windows Version.  I am presently looking for an alternative photo editing program to switch to"
0,I downloaded this product to my computer from the internet and it did not work properly.  So ended up &#34;uninstalling&#34; it.  Should have had them to send me the disc instead.  Just lost $100 or whatever it was I paid for it.  WIll not order an on-line computer products again.
1,Clearly the poorest-quality release of what used to be a useful product. It took me hours to get the screens back to a useable format and many of the functions are hidden so well I still have not been able to find them. On-line communications with accounts are buggy at best (refuses to update the online balance for several without making multiple contact; had to completely reset two accounts; still can't get a bank with multiple accounts to work correctly).
0,"I installed on my Windows 7 ultimate and everything went fine until I ran a full system scan .......after two days this antivirus kept being stuck at 80% of the scan and the worst was it was using 99% of the pc's ram memory, I had to cancel the task. I went and bought Avira Pro and this one is working perfectly without any issues."
4,My son-in-law recommended avast for my computer and I have loved it ever since I have downloaded it!  Great protection!
3,"I've been using QBS for years for my small business and I find it stable, intuitive and useful. It works well between me and my CPA too."
2,It could be my fault because I was used to Quicken. It is hard to find easy answers to questions such as closing reconciled statements.
3,everything from ordering to downloading went just as expected & easily. The product itself is overpriced but who can do without these products/programs/applications...need to be compatible with work
1,I down loaded the new software I did not get the manual with it.  I want to set up a business account and with no instructions it is very difficult to do.  How can I get the instruction manual.<br /><br />Charles L Salem
3,Much easier than dealing with paper and less expensive than in-person service. Could use better navigation for what-if situations (e.g. late additions to IRA or HSA accounts).
1,This works by breaking everything into tables. You basically have to create a bunch of tiny cells and combine them to build your site. Not easy to use. I gave up after a couple months trying to create a decent website.
0,"I installed it on my  Alienware M17x. Before the installation was finished, my laptop froze, making it impossible to use. Had to copy the my documents using a recovery software and then did a factory reset(had to). Then I tried to install it again and same problem."
0,You cant buy this if you have ever had a CC account. Lame
4,"I saw the two reviews before mine and was confused by them. I've used this product (was called Tax Cut Home and Business) for over ten years just to do Business and Trust returns, Then moving those incomes or losses to the clients 1040. It's a very inexpensive tax program compared to others. Perhaps they should contact a professional. I would offer my services but I'm not taking on any new clients. This is an excellent all in one tax program. It does take a while to get use to moving between the forms but, if you use the guide it will keep you out of trouble. You can call H&R Block for advice if it really gets too deep for you. Check for updates often this year."
2,The only thing preventing 5 stars is the price.  I've been using Turbo tax for many years now.  It's simple and straightforward.
4,"Read your dircetions carefully and you will not have to refer to customer service.  Users are asked to record a new product code in the directions.  I recorded  and entered the new product key when instructed, and was rewarded with an error free download."
3,"I was looking for security suite for all of my computers.  After doing some reserach it was down to Kaspersky PURE or Norton 360.  I decided to take a chance with Norton, and I must say I am happy with the results.  The memory and procesing power are well balanced and I found minimum intrusion of my workload.  The suite has nice features, it's easy to navigate and in my case, it's a good solution to my security needs.  I was hesitant to buy Norton based on some reviews that expressed dissapointment with the memory and processing power usasge.  I am running window XP and Vista, and so far I have not seem very large use of proceing power or memory by Norton. My tasks that require a lot of processing power are scheduled at times when I am away from the computer.  I'm a happy customer !"
3,"We've been using Norton for years, and probably will for years to come.  Three licenses is perfect, as that covers mine and my wife's laptops and our \\""file server\\"".    UPDATE:  When using N.I.S. with Windows 8.1 I experienced that it would arbitrarily stop working occasionally - MTBF was anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of weeks.  The only way that I could get it to work again was to either uninstall and re-install N.I.S. or do a system restore back to an earlier time when it was working properly.  I put up with this longer than I should have (I'm generally not that patient) until one day it just pi--ed me off enough to do something about it.  I went to the Norton/Symantec web site and in the Customer Support/FAQ area I came across the exact symptoms that I was experiencing.  The first recommended corrective action listed was to disable the Fast Boot feature in Windows.  So I did that and so far so good.  My laptop does start up a little slower, but not a lot.  After researching how Fast Boot actually works, I prefer not utilizing that feature anyway - I think a completely cold shut down gives you a cleaner startup and a healthier operating system.  Because of this apparent incompatibility I downgraded N.I.S. from 5 to 4 stars."
4,I have been using Norton AV for 20+years and I am a big fan.  This product is evolutionary and could not be easier to use.  I have used there customer service and it is quite good.  This is their best product yet!
4,I really enjoy the simplicity of the system.  It is connected to my bank and makes reconciling accounts very easy.  I have reports at my fingertips which makes filing taxes a breeze or applying for credit really easy because the data is easily available.
0,"Hate it. Came preloaded on new laptop. Worked without a problem for 2 weeks. Now, keeps trying to stream when starting or simply doesn't respond."
4,I have been using Quicken Deluxe for a number of years and have found nothing equal to or better than this product.
2,"it does what it should do, stop virus' but I hate the constant popups about this that and the other thing. Make me want to go back to Norton"
1,"I upgraded from Quicken 2013 to 2015 more or less because they force you or some online services things don't work anymore.  I find 2015 to have  a very buggy user interface.  In the Bill Pay section you have to click enter twice or it will not take. In the register, you have to click the check number field to once to get the drop down arrow to appear to do anything.  After adding an attachment to a transaction, if you don't click enter button on the screen instead of pressing the enter key, the whole thing fails.  I could go on and on.  2013 had a solid interface and i regret upgrading."
2,"Each year, Quicken does small things to make the annual purchase of Quicken/Turbotax an option.  I switched from 2010 to 2013.  Overall, I am happy with the upgrade; however there are no earthshaking improvements, just minor modifications and enhancements.<br /><br />The ability to sync with your mobile devices is earthshaking.  However, as i found out the hard way: make sure you update to the most recent release BEFORE you sync to the Quicken cloud.  The reason is that there were some bugs in the initial releases (I experienced double entries in Split transactions each time I synced.  I believe this has been recently fixed (as of 11/2012), but check this before it gets out of hand and messes with your net worth!"
4,Works as advertised. Only smaller issues with new versions.
0,"Good luck getting this to run.  In order to start quickbooks, it usualy requires several system reboots and restoring from backup.  Once you finally get it to run.  You can probably use it easily all day long until your next reboot.  Then it will take hours of your time trying to get quickbooks to actually run again.<br /><br />This has not been a problem on previous versions of quickbooks but on 2015 Pro, it is not worth using.  If you have a previous version of quickbooks, DON'T UPGRADE....<br /><br />I hate peachtree but, it looks like I have no choice but to move.  Intuit just doesn't have the ability to produce valid software anymore."
1,no it did not work write
4,"I got this specifically to watch 3D blu rays.<br /><br />This is the ONLY software I have found that effectively plays 3D blu rays. The other programs only end up using one core of the CPU, and hence you get significant hiccups in the playback. PowerDVD uses all cores (you need at least 3 for 3D playback.).<br /><br />The feature I really like is its ability to convert normal movies (including blu-rays, unlike PowerDVD 11) into 3D. It does a pretty good job about it honestly."
4,"Ever since I first read about an independent test that rated it the best free AV (most malware stopped, and equally important, least false positives) - about 7 years ago - I tried it, loved it, used it ever since (5 machines at our house, plus several friends' machines). Millions swear by it, not at it (unlike even some expensive packages).<br /><br />9"
2,"i purchased this because the version i was using was getting old.  i do not see much improvement over the 2012 version that i was using.  the one benefit i saw is that the balance is more correct.  i had a $27 error, that i took great pains to find in the 2012 version, without success.  my bank balance, and quicken match to the penny, without any correction.  don't know why, but my mother always told me never lick a gift horse in the mouth."
1,"I've always been able to do my taxes with the deluxe version but I guess this year they decided to rip off their customers by forcing majority of deluxe users to go to the more expensive premiere version for the same functionality. As far as the software goes, it's no different than previous years just that you need to pay more this year. Maybe it's time to leave TurboTax...who knows what they'll force us to pay for next year."
1,Unnecessary bells and whistles; accomplishing tasks is not as straightforward as it should be. (Big time-waster.)
1,"Turbo Tax was fine for simple tax returns.  However, we had some capital gains this year.  At  turbo tax request, I had to purchase the upgrade to Premier then had to purchase the state of MS software.  I still could not get my questions answered.  I do not recommend Turbo Tax for anything but simple tax returns.  Very disappointed.  Spend your money on a tax professional."
4,"My computer guy installed Avast in my computer, when something slipped be McAfee.  I have never had a problem with anything since then.  Am completely satisfied with it."
2,"Quicken 2015 is better than Essentials, but still not as good as the Windows version. Not sure why, but the Mac version has less functionality. Reconciliation and acct to acct transfers initiated within Quicken for the Mac either don't exist or are inferior."
1,"Me: &#34;I wondered if the sun rises in the East?&#34;<br /><br />Long delay.<br /><br />Chat: &#34;So, you has been having problems with your bread machine.&#34;<br /><br />When I works, Quicken is useful. But there is no effective support when I fails -- usually after purported upgrades. I have come to believe that Chat representatives across all software and on-line merchants are hired to discourage customers from pursuing issues. For example: Today I launched a chat with Quicken, noting that the update link with Chase had failed amidst finger pointing.<br /><br />Unlinking the account using the Tools requires the program to link with Chase. Yes. Strange but true. The result: Each time I update accounts the program tries to correct the error, locking my Chase account and requiring a new password. The Chat rep mulled this for four minutes and then asked? &#34;So you want to create an account with Chase?&#34;"
0,"I would not use this product again, I caused too many issues on my pc. and if you buy the suite, I found it had some issues if you are running Windows 8.1. Grimm fighter s/w does work on win 8.1. I removed all Avast s/w."
3,I have been using this program for over 5 years and am very pleased with the service.
0,"I upgraded from Quicken 2012 as the transaction download life was coming to an end. Since then it's been downhill, due to the bugs (even after installing the latest updates). Here's a sample list of known issues<br /><br />*Cannot import/review transactions from Brokerage accounts (https://quicken.intuit.com/support/help/downloading-accounts-and-transactions-from-your-bank/quicken-says-there-are-transactions-to-accept-but-do-not-see-any/GEN82180.html)<br />*Cannot copy year end file with a password (https://qlc.intuit.com/questions/1027228-quicken-2015-h-b-quicken-cannot-use-a-blank-password)<br />*Empty dialog box freezes the program (https://qlc.intuit.com/questions/1056715-getting-an-empty-dialogue-box-service-provider-change-ok-right-away-then-program-freezes-whenever-i-try-to-do-an-update-mondo-update-is-installed)"
1,"I just upgraded from Quicken 2012. I use Quicken’s “Savings Goals” feature extensively and find it invaluable. I was disappointed that some of the Savings Goals features available in the 2012 version were no longer available in the 2013 version. For instance, I could no longer place a “Savings Goal” icon in my Quicken taskbar. Additionally, the Savings Goal account window was drastically altered, and did not display each savings goal detail properly. I telephoned Quicken tech support, but the rep was of no help. Their software engineers really screwed up this wonderful feature.<br /><br />I found the new Mobile App to be a complete let down. The interaction with the Quicken program was limited. I was hoping for the ability to enter transactions while on the road, but no such luck.<br /><br />I found Quicken 2013 to be a waste of time and money. In the end, I uninstalled Quicken 2013, and reinstalled 2012."
2,"I am pretty happy with the main software, i.e the federal return. But this is not a good option if you need to file multiple states returns. While the initial software is priced very reasonably, it only comes with one state. They get you on subsequent stats which are charged at $39 a pieces plus tax. Additional fee for electronic filing is added on. So each additional state costs more than the federal&one state combined.<br />Also not good for filing amended returns. I recently purchased NY state to file the amended return and was unable to complete the task for two reasons.<br />1. The form required (IT-203-X) is not available<br />2. The software is stuck in electronic filing mode, which is indeed required by the NY state for the main filing but not for amended returns, which need to be filed by mail."
0,Don't buy this!  I had nothing else open on my computer and it kept freezing up to the point where I was unable to edit my music at all.  I kept having to close it and open it again and it kept freezing up in the middle of playing a song.  Junk!!!  I wish there was an option for zero stars.
1,"Finally decided our old version probably needed updating.<br /><br />Data file transfer went well<br /><br />However, this is an extremely buggy program, doing backups periodically give error messages, scheduled payments do not enter in the register when you clock &#34;Enter&#34;.<br /><br />Argh...they're up to R5 on Quicken 2014 and still had bugs. Very disappointed. Wish there was a decent competitor."
2,Needed a program to track my personal checking account.  Grew up on MS Money and loved it but had a major computer crash.
3,"I have used the download for a few years, good product for a good price. My wife is sole proprieter of her business, and this product fits that need just fine."
2,"Not having read the description thoroughly, i though Access was still included with MS Office.  It's not.  Sigh."
0,Spent an hour on the phone with Customer Service and wasn't able to get my account set up to work!  Quicken Mac 2015 has too many bugs! Im asking for a refund. Really too bad as I am a huge fan of Mint.com and TurboTax!
3,"With fear from all the problems seen by others, we waited till the last day to upgrade from V 2010.  Install and migration went without a hitch.  Key points:  We have never gotten our INVESTMENTS to report as desired, so punted that.  Standard accounts (banking, credit cards, etc.) ported without a hitch.  We manage rental property, too.  My wife likes the new retirement planning tool(s).  I believe the s/w is stable, but clearly it not meeting everyone's needs and wants in a financial management tool.  All should be cautious in interpreting 1-5 &#34;Stars&#34; ratings for:  Does it do what it says it does?  Or, is the rating based on comments on &#34;It doesn't do what *I* want it to do.&#34;  My wife uses Quicken daily and downloads data daily from institutions.  We do NOT use tablet or smartphone interfaces."
1,"With each revision, each update, the software becomes more difficult to use, more complicated.  Their downloading credit card transactions used to be quick and seamless.  Now if you are not very careful, downloading will make changes to non-downloaded accounts, requiring hours to figure out why your account balances have been mysteriously changed.  With revision 6 of 2015, balances don't even show unless you limit your sorting options to &#34;date&#34;.  This company obviously has too many coders who feel like they have to be useful, so they have taken what used to be an excellent product and turned it into a mediocre product.  Time to review my options, see what Microsoft has to offer, and other companies.  This company has cost me way too much time correcting errors in my databases caused by its software."
2,"I like the layout and appearance of the Mac version compared to the Windows version. There are two things that are needed:<br />1.  Very disappointing that I cannot use Quicken bill pay in the Mac version.<br />2.  I'd like to be able to check \\""all reviewed\\"" when I look at individual transactions rather than having to click on every one."
2,"fresher look is nice, but there are features missing (it appears) that I liked but do not seem to be included in the new version:<br />*ability to create customized \\""quick fill\\"" window with my transactions where I can click to enter as a new transaction with all fields filled in<br />*ability to shrink the register window without losing visibility on columns<br />*transfer between accounts seems to be more complicated and less intuitive compared to Quicken2007<br />*ability to set up automatic file back-ups to a designated folder location is either missing or I just can't find it.  It appears back files need to be created manually each time.<br /><br />Like all things new I am sure some issues are due to my lack of familiarity with the new version after using just 1 month.  However, some things just seem to be dropped from older version.  As with most applications, the user doesn't have much choice when support for the old versions is no longer available so we're forced to upgrade for better or worse, and there's usually some of both in my experience."
1,Did not include any state tax feature. Deceptive sale since it usually comes with at least one state. The cost to get the sate feature doubled the price of the software. I had to use it though since I needed to complete everything by tax day day.
4,for 20 bucks works for blu rays
3,"Works well for what I use it for, It would be nice to have Publisher in the package along with Outlook Express. Maybe in Window 10."
4,"[[ASIN:B00AJ5HMA2 Movavi Screen Capture Studio 4 Personal Edition [Download]]]<br /><br />I bought this software to record tutorials for my online business, I have never had a problem with it. . .in fact it's the best capture software I've ever owned. It is VERY easy to use, in fact if you can't figure out how to use it then you must be brain dead! The video converter feature is convenient and user friendly.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product for first time users that want professional, High-Def videos for on screen recording."
2,"I purchased this turbo tax software package to include state workup.

4,"I'll admit I was skeptical, as I always am with software, but I am very pleased with this purchase.  Sure, it's not as fancy as some of the higher end competitors, but if you need something simple that still has all the main bells and whistles, this one is perfect.  There's plenty of really cool effects that are easily tweaked to your liking and editing clips is as easy as it could be.  It handles all my 720HD clips, though it does slow down considerably if too many tracks get used, on my computer, at about 5 tracks. For my needs I would probably never exceed that anyway.  This product is great for beginners or more advanced users, I highly recommend it."
1,"Having been a happy Norton Internet Security user for more than 10 years, this time my advice is to wait for more weeks or months till Norton fixes existing problems. NIS 2013 affects your windows 7 login and shutdown processes taking 40 to 50 seconds more than usual. your computer seams sluggish at times. Sometimes after the windows 7 login, the computer freezes due to ccSvcHst.exe problems. Have had some crashes with firefox and chrome because of Norton addin. The new interface is complex when it was so simple in NIS 2012. It makes you feel the product is still on Beta.  NIS2013 version 20.1.1.2.  My PC config is i7, 6GB RAM and virus free."
3,well i need this program but microsoft wont allow the instalation and the site is messed up with no support numbers. wont allow download....  well after my last review I was able to install it when using Internet Explorer. The install went smooth and everything worked as promised.
0,"I've be a loyal user or quicken for over 20 years...When quicken Home & Business cam out, I really liked it.<br />I've loved all their quicken versions that they have released over the years. I've always used Home & business since I have a small business.<br />Last year, I bought a smart phone, so I bought quicken home & business 2014. I downloaded the mobile app.<br />I hooked up to the quicken cloud.<br />Its been a DISASTER on and off since I hooked up with my mobile app to the 2014 version.<br />Sometimes it works GREAT....I can download and sync back and forth easily.<br />When something happens, (I get these cc 501 error messages) it takes me hours for it to grt fixed with these quicken guys online.<br />I've been online with these guys on and off since January for about 20 hours!!!!!!<br />They have to get the bugs out of the mobile and cloud and sync part.<br />I am just about DONE for being a quicken customer.  I would give them an F for the mobile part of their program."
2,the back up part is not working but everything else works fine it.but this could be my computer and not the software itself
2,"I am posting this review in mid January 2013 to help people who may be trying to decide what tax software and which versions to get. Because of pending tax law interpretations and such, the software recommends that you don't file taxes as of mid-January 2013.<br /><br />I have been using H&R Block software for at least a decade. Last year I used the boxed software version and the installation was rather frustrating. So this year I got the Windows digital download version. Installation was trouble free with the PC download, but still a bit cumbersome.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with the Amazon digital download software, here is a rough outline of what happened.<br /><br />Immediately after you buy, you can begin the download process. First you have to save to your computer an executable that is the downloadable Amazon installer (under 1MB). At this point, it may be a good idea to save open files and close programs.<br /><br />After you download the downloable Amazon installer, and you run it, it starts downloading the H&R Block installation software (around 50MB). This makes the user interface jumpy, thus the save open files sentence above. This on a quad core Windows 7 desktop. This completed without problems.<br /><br />After the H&R Block installation software downloaded, it was time to install the actual software. I clicked on Install in the Amazon downloader program. Then clicked on View Keys to see the software key (opens in browser window). You have to accept license. You can view the privacy policy (opens in browser window, readable size but small fonts - maybe the fear of Professor Elizabeth Warren is encouraging financial companies to be more honest and upfront these days?).<br /><br />Installation takes a few minutes. then you click Finish. Reboot is not needed. Then start the software for the first time. Enter the \\""key code\\"" (the Amazon Downloader is still open (unless you closed it) and you can get the Keys there. Once this is successful, you cannow close the Amazon Downloader. Then you register the software (optional). Then you are prompted to check for updates and surely it finds updates and installs them. This needs to close the H&R Block software, install the updates and restart the H&R Block software.<br /><br />Then you can start a tax return. If you previously used H&R Block software, you browse the Windows file system to find last year's return and import it. You can also select where to save the current year return. It puts it at a default location by default. Make sure you change it if you have a different file organizing scheme from what Windows thinks you should have. Next you can import data from financial software (if applicable to your case). From here on, you can start entering data, using their interview-format or going directly to the forms if you are a tax guru.<br /><br />Just like previous years, you get five free federal e-files but zero state e-files. It would be more fair to consumers if you got five free e-files and it would be up to you to select between federal or state! Fix it H&R Block! I took one star away for this.<br /><br />This version includes a free State program. As of Dec 13 2012, the State software was not ready, but you could enter your state of preference and email address and an email was sent when the state software was ready. State software became available at some point in January 2013. Installation of the State software was smooth after following all the prompts.<br /><br />Overall, installation was trouble free but still cumbersome. H&R Block uses Install Shield. Installing a program on Windows versus installing one on Android or iOS perhaps is a perhaps good snapshot of why Windows is falling out of favor with consumers.<br /><br />Usability wise, it is more or less the same good old user interface and work flow of previous years."
1,I did not like this years Turbo Tax. I am considering switching to some one else next year. I've been using Turbo Tax for several years and found that the software this year was not as user friendly and had hidden fees which I did not appreciate.
0,"So glad I saw the reviews before I ordered! I can't be the only retiree with a modest income derived partly from investments. Hello Intuit, that means I need schedule D! You just lost a growing number of retiring baby boomers. I'm off to try H&R Block."
0,Avoid!<br /><br />Still trying to get my refund.  Silence from intuit about it.  Awful software baring only a shadow of its former glory.
2,"This software has a pretty steep learning curve so be ready.  I think in the long run it is going to save me time because I am using the time entry and invoicing portion.  I used to do this manually.  It will look more professional to have the QB invoices.  You should look at the home page to get an understanding of how the money and data flows in QB.  I am not an accountant so this does not come naturally to me.  Only use the parts of QB that you need then build up slowly.  If you only want an electronic check register, stick with Quicken!!!!"
1,"Very disappointing as compared to dragon for PC. Every time I complete a sentence it throws in a small or large cap letter that I have to backspace to remove, every time.W .......see!"
3,Works great
3,"The description says<br /><br />\\"" *New* Imports a PDF of Last Year's Tax Return - Easily imports prior year tax data/documents from TurboTax, other tax software brands^4 and tax stores.^5\\""<br /><br />My frustration with having accidentally deleted my TurboTax-specific tax file (file extension \\"".tax2010\\"" is that TurboTax 2011 does NOT import PDFs generated by TurboTax 2009 or 2010.  As a result, I had to type in all of my 2010 tax information by opening the TurboTax-generated PDF document using Adobe Acrobat Viewer and also my W2, 1099, and donation forms, and retype all of this data in, essentially re-doing my 2010 Taxes (no printing or e-filing, just saved the re-entered version), just to make sure I had an accurate 2010 TurboTax file to work on and complete my 2011 taxes.<br /><br />The good news is that I was able to very quickly do my 2011 taxes after re-familiarizing myself with the process as I entered my 2010 data again.  I usually e-file my federal taxes and then print out and mail my state taxes, to save a few bucks, but in the last 2 years I have gotten lazy and just paid the $20 to e-file my state taxes, too.  As usual, I am so glad to be done with my taxes for the year."
3,used for years. only worth it after they realized the pricing gaffe
1,"The downloadable version is slow and clunky for Mac.  There was a glitch in downloading last years info also.  TurboTax was only giving the 10% extra for Amazon if you download (as opposed to using the online version-only 5%).  now i see why, that is the only way they could get people to download this poorly put together Mac software."
0,"Never had any problems with quicken upgrades until 2015 which is the poorest excuse for software, and especially an upgrade, that I have ever experienced. Two nights ago I downloaded/bought it. Next morning I do the updates since software released. Forgot how many, but they were numerous. 2015 must have come on the market less than half-baked. Was on support hold for more than 45 minutes without talking to anyone. Finally, yesterday evening, I used chat. That was around an hour of time. When we ended, I could open it. I didn't try doing any updating of accounts or anything else because I had had it with Q 15. This morning, I started to do my account updates. After I clicked on updates it wanted a quicken ID although in preferences I marked no passwords. Quicken ID won't recognize my password; so I go through the Forgot Password exercise in futility about 4 times. Each time I change, each time it doesn't recognize it. So, I close down, I restart, and guess what? I cannot even open a quicken file until I log in with my Quicken ID, which is a phantom.  If I until I'm presuming I have to reinstall 14 since they removed it during the 15 installation process. Not only would I not recommend it, I would highly discourage anyone from making my mistake."
4,"Program works great, better than Open Office and much better priced (FREE) than M/S Office"
0,I purchased Norton antivirus and downloaded it.  The message that I receive from Norton is that the product key is not valid.  I can't return the product because it's a download and can't use it because the key is not valid.  Wasted my money!
0,I used TurobTax 2011 and everything seemed OK. I now have 2012 home and business and we had a few issues. Telephone support doesn't exist and I waited online for nearly 30 minutes for online chat support. Ended up their solution didn't help and I had to figure the problem out myself.<br />Now we find out from 2 different accountants that it places an incorrect ceiling on my wife's IRA contributions. Tried to get hold of TurboTax support and just couldn't get through.<br />Going to ditch TurboTax and get something that works.<br />Main problem is that you never know how many other bugs exist in their software and the whole idea of support is bing able to pickup a phone and actually talk to someone - doesn't exist with TurboTax no matter what you've been told.
2,"The new system is very SLOW.  In addition, features that were previously very intuitive in Quicken Essentials are really very confusing.  For Example, when taking a prior transaction that has splits and using it again where updates are needed it just doesn't recalculate correctly.  I hope Intuit continues to invest in the product since it needs a bunch more work"
3,"I am a small business owner and have been using Quick Books for about a year and a half.  I'm pretty intelligent, have worked extensively with a number of software programs, and have had accounting classes before, but I would say that one really needs to have a good grasp of accounting and general ledger entries to use this software effectively.  I finally decided I was in over my head and downloaded Quicken.  I read all of the reviews and was a little scared about what I was going to get, but have been pretty pleased so far.  It seems like those who wrote negative reviews were people who had had Quicken before and who migrated their data to a new version.  I was starting fresh so I didn't experience any of those problems.<br /><br />I only gave this a 4 for three reasons.  One, I think the Customer Center in Quick Books is much better thought out that anything I've found in Quicken so far.  And, two, I used the set up &#34;wizard&#34; to download my banking transactions twice and got an error both times.  I would have returned the product right then and there, but saw there was a manual way to do the download and it has worked for me.  Last, there are some things I haven't been able to figure out yet which means there are some things that could have been designed easier.  All in all though, this is a nice, basic, easy accounting package."
4,Love this new software.  Love the sync with your ipad feature.  I just open recipes on my ipad in the kitchen now - I don't even have to print them.  First sync takes a while but after that it is so quick.  You can import recipes from almost anywhere.  I can't even tell you how much this program does.  I love it.  Don't know how I ever got along without it.  I have been a user of Cook'n for a lot of years and this new update is the cats meow.<br /><br />Run and get this program as fast as you can.  I also bought one for my daughter and we can each input our recipes and then share them with each other.  Awesome.
2,Better than it used to be.  Still Quickbooks could do better.
3,"Fantastic, sometime a little too strict, I would rather pause the protection, now and then, instead of the virus issues.."
3,I have been using CS2 for years thinking that was all I needed to edit my photos and believe me when I say this is light years ahead into the future of photo editing.I haven't tested all the new features so I cannot go into a lot of specifics here but I'm impressed with the new interface and the 3D feature.Cropping is even better now.Great product at a great price!
0,I have the 2014 version of this program and pretty much hate it.  Unless you are a tech geek or have aspergers you will likely find this program clunky and irritating to use.  If you are at all right brained and looking for something intuitive that can easily be played with to figure out how to use it look elsewhere.  Designs must be assembled in a specific order that is not readily apparent.  Instructions use arcane language such as &#34;dialog box&#34; and are worse than a car manual. For me they might as well be written in Chinglish.  The act of simply drawing a line can involve so many steps that I wish I'd just invested in a drafting table.  I'm so irritated with this program that the voice alone in the tutorial videos makes me want to scream.  If you take a class this program it may be usable but it certainly won't be fluid.  For me a total waste of $400 sum bucks.
0,I read a review giving this software top ranking amongst other typing software. I read the other comments where people were having difficulty with not installing or creating problems with the computer. I decided to buy it anyways and of course it doesn't install! Amazon needs to start reading comments if this software creates problems. I noticed people were having problems when they bought the cd too. Looks like I'm not buying the cd either.
0,"I've used turbotax for years.  This year in particular, it seems particularly broken.  After spending hours waiting for support to help me with a bug in the program dealing with California SDI amounts, things went nowhere.  A few days later, my incident report was closed as fixed.  I hopefully updated my installed version of turbotax, only to encounter the exact same problem.  I then completely uninstalled Turbotax, and reinstalled the latest version of 2014 directly from Intuit.  The latest version is even MORE broken than previous releases.  It now has lost the fact that my turbotax install INCLUDED state, and wants me to BUY state AGAIN, AND it still won't let me file my taxes.  Avoid turbotax 2014, as it is utterly broken."
2,It was okay but I installed McAffee.
4,"Love it. Found it on Amazon for 28.00 including shipping. I don't know abt other experiences but mine has been awesome. It found a threat on a priorly unprotected doid maxx on installation. I was able to fix the.issue<br /> Have been using for over a year and I have tried kaspersky, avg and a handful of others. I know there's always the chance a few people have compatibility issues though I've had none, and I have it on 2 Samsung tablets and two droid maxx phones. I will be loading it on all my reviews. I like it becuz it doesn't bug u and pop up constantly. Its scans fast and accurately. Good software. Try it! Don't pay 80.00$, 60.00$ or even 50-60.00$ for anti virus software!!!!!! I got in on Amazon, the gray live safe for 28.00$"
0,"Quicken / Intuit is a large company with many bad habits. YOU HAVE TO BE MADE AWARE THAT YOU DON'T BUY A SOFTWARE !!!!!!!!!! IN FACT YOU RENT A SOFTWARE.<br /><br />After a certain delay, Quicken will deny you access to your financial data even if they are on your C:/ Drive. THIS IS NEVER MENTIONNED WHEN YOU BUY PRODUCTS. You can access back your data stored on your C:/ Drive only when you pay $40 fees. This is a TOTAL RIPOFF.<br /><br />Intuit does not respect clients in Quebec: no service in French is available. This is totally against the laws."
4,Wouldn't ever want to be without it!
4,used it for years love it just wished it was so expensive to buy a 2nd state.  it was almost as much as the program itself.
3,I have used office for 10yrs now.  I read all the complaints about office 2013 and after a few months I don't get it.  Yes it is a little tacky looking but you get used to it. Other then that its still just MS office everything I use on a daily basis was still there never missed a beat. Only thing that drives me nuts is in Excel when you move around the box lags a little. That's about the only complaint I have. They do want you to sign into it so they can get more of your info but you they do let you option out. I will say after windows 8 and 8.1 problems I was skeptical. Thankfully I have had not problems.
3,This 2015 works great.
3,"Ease of use and navigation.  A couple of minor things when ready to file/print, but not a big deal.  Would use again just as I have for years."
3,Turbotax really confused people this year by labelling former &#34;Deluxe&#34; or &#34;Premier&#34; additions with strange labels like Investments & Rental Property in the case of Premier. I gave it 4 stars because its still a good product and they gave me a $25 refund check. Marketers make mistakes sometimes
2,"I downloaded this program for a specific job.<br /><br />I used it, it did what it was supposed to do and I got paid."
1,"This product acts like a trial because after less than a month an annoying Norton sign appeared telling me that I had no antivirus coverage as my coverage expired. At first when I tried to enter the key, the next button would never work, so I rebooted the computer, unintalled the product, and tried again and again then the key finally worked. Only time will tell how this product works."
3,I like this product very attractive . Bye.
0,BUY A DISC<br /><br />Have been attempting to download for the past two hours and am still on hold with customer support. Went to the online community and there are currently 33 people out there that are having the same problem.<br /><br />The download would be a &#34;Godsend&#34; IF IT WORKED.....
1,I was satisfied with the Federal return but the State refund I did on Turbo tax was completely wrong.  I had to do it myself by hand.
4,A fantastic Program I have done without because of upgrading from Vista to Windows 7. Very happy to finally have it back. Nothing beats Word!
3,I very much like this program (I downloaded the test version from the Mediachance site) but wish Amazon had a more recent version. The Mediachance site shows version 4.0 (2014) being the current version but the version available through Amazon appears to be version 2.
0,"Don't purchase this product unless you want to pay additional fees.  I have been a TTax customer for both business and personal for 15 yrs.  All previous years I purchased the Deluxe version and had all 1040 forms needed to file my return.  This year, I had to upgrade to the premium version (~$40 with tax) to get 1040 Form C to calculate in my K1 from my partnership.  I saw in other reviews that others got the upgrade for free.  Unless intuit changes their product marketing model, I consider this an incomplete product and will purchase either the TaxAct or H&R Block products next year."
2,"Product is good.<br /><br />It takes an act of God in order to get the download using just the software key.<br />I tried for about an hour.<br />Then, contacted Norton via chat.<br />It only took them about 30-45 minutes to be able to get it to download.<br /><br />I don't understand Symantec's policy of changing products almost every year...<br />in order to introduce a new product that is marginally better than the previous."
3,Love how it can be overridden if I make a mistake. Easily pulls everything together to view by accountant. Would like to have free I updates
1,"I used a free trial of Office 365 for a month and was very pleased.  However the day they took money from my account for the subscription, it stopped editing and signing me in. All tabs are missing across the page only the document appears, no editing.  Spent time with a support person.  He thinks I don't know how to use Windows 8 or I've gotten a virus or virtually all my files are corrupted!  I can open them in Abi Word and other things just fine.  Support did no good at all.  I depend on this for a living and am now harmed because I have long, uneditable documents I can't open in other programs either,  because I was stupid enough to save it in their docx format.  This could cost me a great deal and is wasting hours of time. Does Microsoft pay for the loss of a book manuscript ?"
0,"Purchased as an upgrade to the wimpy and incredibly dumbed-down Quicken Essentials for Mac. It was not an upgrade. This program is virtually identical to Essentials, except that it is supposed to keep track of investments. Unfortunately, it does this improperly, so the graphs and figures it presents are useless. This program can't decide whether I'm a millionaire or a broke 26 year old living in my parent's basement. It did determine that I'm an idiot, after spending $50 on this piece of garbage."
2,"I would be 100% satisfied with this product if I felt I owned it after paying $140 for it. You pay and download, but it appears that I have to repurchase it after a year, or if something happens to my computer, etc. If I am wrong about that, I would love to know."
1,I have gotten windows 8 before putting this on my computer after a few days I could not find nor get back on. I would like another download or my money back.
3,great
2,"All three programs seem like simplified versions of the &#34;real thing&#34;.  My computer was wiped clean, and until I invest<br />in a new computer, Office 365 will serve my purposes.  I am grateful to have this subscription available for now."
2,complicated non user friendly programming that requires to much time to figure out.  Im pretty savvy when it comes to software and have owned several different home designing ones - this by far is the most complicated.
4,"I cannot believe that this software was only $25! After using Adobe Premiere 30-day trial, I realized that it was more than I needed and far too complicated for a novice (I am editing high definition videos of educational conferences). Moved over to VideoStudio Pro X7 and was very happy. It did everything I needed it to do and more! Intuitive, works great, no crashing, and solid output. Highly recommend."
0,"Buyer Beware...  Turbo Tax does not back up their 100% Accuracy Guarantee.  I have been using Turbo Tax for years and was contemplating changing this year to another software because of all the controversy.  I wish I had.  I processed and filed my return and then found out that the Deluxe Turbo Tax software had a bug in it when it processed the HSA data for year 2015.  I received a SIGNIFICANTLY lower refund ($1,790) than I would have had it processed the data correctly.  I called customer service , spent over 2 hours waiting on hold, was switch to two people.  The &#34;customer service&#34; representative indicated this was a known software issue but since I had filed my return Turbo Tax would file an amended return on my behalf once the software glitch was fixed (which was about an 8 day wait from the time I called).  The &#34;customer service&#34; representative said he would call me once the software was fixed and let me know how they would file an amended return.  INSTEAD of receiving any call, they closed my open call case with the only designation that new software updates were available.  I HAVE already filed my return , was given the 100% accuracy guarantee, however, Turbo Tax did not follow through.  I would highly recommend you not purchase this software , they do not adhere to the 100% accuracy guarantee.  I am extremely disappointed that my loyalty to this product was met with such disdain for my request they back up their 100% accuracy guarantee and the guarantee from their customer service representative that Turbo Tax would file an amended return on my behalf due to THEIR software error.  I finally got in touch with a supervisor after hours on the phone.  Resolution of the issue poorly handled."
1,"I have used Adobe Photoshop at work for about 10 years, but I've never upgraded and am still using the original product.  I don't use a lot of the features, so I'm probably not a good one to review this, but I'm upset enough to do so.  I finally ordered it for my home computer because I saw that they had greeting cards software with it.  I make my own greeting cards for my family, so I thought that would be great.  So far, I haven't been able to figure it out.  It seems to have very few choices and none of them work with the cards I use and when I try to get into using it, it says I can't unless I become a plus member, which costs a monthly fee.  I'm very unhappy, because it's so complicated now, I doubt I'll use the photoshop part much either. (It's just easier to use the Windows software).  It was a waste of money for me."
2,"I, like others, really disliked this product. When Mac Quicken 2007 was rendered useless by Yosemite, I was at first scared off by the reviews for Q 2015. I looked around for an alternative, but found nothing that satisfied all my requirements (which, by the way, are all available on Quicken for Windows). So I swallowed hard and downloaded the new Mac version. The reviews were right. I hated it. So why three stars? Because I followed the simple online steps to request a refund and about three weeks later received a check in the mail from Intuit. No hassle, no arguments, no questions asked. I appreciate that in a company and will gladly give Mac Quicken 2016 or 2017 or 2020 (or whenever they get the message) another shot."
0,"I loved all the updates through out the 2000s but this decade is certainly not putting out as compelling updates anymore. Long standing annoyances remain after continually asking Adobe for remedies. I wonder how well Serif will compete in this area? Their Affinity line of products have offered very good alternatives to Illustrator, Photoshop, and Camera Raw and they are working on an InDesign competitor now too. Hopefully that will kickstart some innovation in this field as Adobe hasn't been too impressive lately."
0,"OHG it is amazing how far the company has fallen.  Was a big fan until I bought Outlook 2013.  Nothing but problems.  Sync issues with IMAP, does not display sent folder size, does  not display attachment icon in sent messages.  Hangs while syncing subscribed folders all the time.  Crashes when looking up linkedin names.  crashes when editing too long and then won't send. The last update March 12 and 13 seemed to make it worse.  Now also issues with auto save and not matching and not sending.<br /><br />I changed conversation view settings and they changed back when I log in and out.  go to export pst file and it crashes, and the file is not very large.<br /><br /> If you have a choice about upgrading or not.  DO NOT!  If you use IMAP email avoid at all costs.<br /><br />call tec support 1.5 hours of bouncing around from agent to agent not know who is responsible, to tell me that they could not help unless I forked over $99.  I think I'll buy Outlook 2010 on eBay for less.  What a waste."
0,"This review isn't about exactly the PhotoStudio 6 product but rather about the ArcSoft company technical support policy. I purchased the Portrait+ 3.0 Photoshop Plugin software directly from this company and installed it my Win 7 computer. I tried to open perfect portrait photo within this plug-in and find out the face couldn't detected. So, I  tried to contact the technical support and find out there is a ridiculous tech support policy - 2-3 business days response time especially for the company who claim their self as a Global Leader In Imaging Technology . I would like to be fair. On my other computer I have Portrait+ version 2 and it's working acceptably well. The company management and marketing team need to understand any product only as good as the support behind it.  So, back to my issue, October 14th I sent the request for support and finally on October 20th I received an answer from the tech support rep. Nancy explaining to me that I don't have stable Internet connection this is why my software doesn't work correctly. I consider myself advanced computer user with more than 20 years of experience in installations, setup, troubleshooting etc. and I can say for sure I have very stable 25 Mbps Down and 10 Mbps Up Internet connection. First of all sorry, I can't accept this explanation as a logical, second - what I have to do for locations where I can't establish an Internet connection???. So, I restore my computer from the image I created before I install ArcSoft software to make sure I have clean computer without any ArcSoft traces. I install the software one more time. Unfortunately I get the same result. &#34;Face Can't be detected!&#34;. l sent the new question to ArcSoft with my direct phone number as well (just in case if they so kind to return the call) and I guess I will have to wait now for another who knows how long. In my opinion it is very unfair to the customers to not be able to call or at least live chat to the technical support team as need it.Meanwhile I have non working software I paid for because it doesn't work the way it promised and company seems like not belong of the 21st Century standards! This is exactly why I agree with Scott's statement to STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!"
2,"All of my prior positive experience over 20 years with Quicken  is now tainted. I moved from 2009 Home and Business to 2013 Home and Business. I have managed to get the new system and my data in order, but not without a lot of time and work. The reporting and budgeting functions took the biggest hit. I am not sure whether I am looking at bugs or intended changes that are poorly described in the documentation.<br /><br />Quicken Programmers, were you outsourced to India or China? I have always used the budget features, and 2013 didn't convert my budget file cleanly. Both the Column and Row Totals as well as category subtotals didn't sum correctly. Through trial and error, manually plugging the totals, I got it to work, but I can't trust it.<br /><br />Also, transaction entries slowed down so much that I have to wait several seconds, and within the investment accounts I have found the Return of Capital (RtnCap) transaction causes the txn amount to move to the \\""Uncategorized\\"" category. If I attempt to put in a category/account, the transaction amount does not get added to my Cash account.<br /><br />Intuit, I understand you have released program changes/fixes since 2013 verion was introduced, but you are not done and six months is ponderously slow. On the surface it looks like you have contract problems with your outsourcer or you fired your best people. Listen to your customers or a competitor will rise up and fill the void. If they do, and you don't correct these problems, I might just be willing to jump over to their ship."
1,This year was more confusing than in the past. I saw lots of things about free state returns but never saw anything about it on as I filed my taxes. I have still not seen my refunds and worry about if they went through correctly. I know I updated every time I logged in but no updates about their program.
2,"This is the same old \\""no bugs fixed\\"" \\""upgrade\\"" Quicken has been foisting on its customers for years!<br /><br />I will start with credit for considerably speeding-up the entire download process.<br /><br />Here are some bugs, mostly from 2009, still in 2013:<br /><br />Ctrl+Home and Ctrl+End STILL respond differently in the investment and banking registers.  The correct \\""Windows standard\\"" result is for these functions to go to the top (first) entry [home] or last entry [end] of the REGISTER.  Home and End (without any other keys held) should go to the extreme left (home) and extreme right (end) of the active FIELD.  From an old DOS program [Gedit, distributed with QDOS], Shift+Home could go to the top entry of the actively viewed register, and Shift+End to the last (empty) entry.  This would considerably enhance navigation.  Speaking of which, it would be nice if the cursor movement keys would work in the Accept downloaded Transactions window.  It would be even nicer if those Transactions could be sorted using the column headings like so many other Windows screens.  It would be really nice if a \\""sort order\\"" feature could be added to the Transactions to be accepted: first by date, then by security/payee then by action.  See Excel's \\""Data/Sort\\"" feature.  Alternatively, have the sequence of column sort create that effect by maintaining the item order as each column heading is clicked.  Lastly, simply provide a way of moving transactions up and down so Accept All can be used.<br /><br />A way to activate \\""edit\\"" for a register line from the keyboard would be a good addition as well.  How about \\""F2\\"", which is Windows keyboard shortcut for editing a file name in the Explorer?  (I needed to change 30 transaction security names and using the mouse was tedious.)  Why doesn't edit-replace work in the investment register?<br /><br />It would really be helpful to be able to access, with a \\""maintenance\\"" feature, the internal links for the various ticker symbols.  I have had manyoccasions when these get out-of-whack and I would prefer to fix them directly rather than deselecting \\""Matched with online security\\"" and praying.<br /><br />Worst problem is the Quicken Catch-22, dating back at least to Quicken 2009.  The security and memo fields, when changed in the investment register, DO NOT change in the \\""linked\\"" banking register.  When a change is made to them in the banking register, a message displays that the change must be made from the investment register \\""to avoid losing data\\"", but it doesn't work.<br /><br />Below is a paste from my bug log file, some of which has been covered above:<br />1-8-2010 Survey:<br />The program is both powerful and limited:  Everywhere a programming decision is made, and not made a user choice, a limitation is created.  For example, downloaded \\""matching\\"" should be made an option (It would be MUCH easier to simply DELETE unwanted transactions rather than deal with the matching, whose action I cannot fathom anyway--and the disposition is unclear, except unmatch, which on occasion is not available.)  Also, in the investment register, downloads are arbitrarily split into \\""cash\\"" (moved to end) and investment, which serves no practical purpose, since only the investment register is sorted by date.  No \\""sort\\"" is available for the downloads (I prefer multiple buys/sells/dividends/etc. on the same day to be alphabetical) nor is there a \\""move up\\"" or \\""move down\\"" feature for the downloaded transaction.  The \\""accept all\\"" button is too (dangerously) close the the \\""accept\\"" button.<br />The reports have become absurd for printing and require exporting to Excel to create a format that is not one security (or two securities) (and category column headings) per page.  Just try the income report by security (50 or so per account) which I use for the tax return and you'll see what I mean.  There is no \\""maintenance\\"" feature to fix the arbitrary association of a security with the electronic security when it's incorrect, such as whenyou mistakenly answer \\""yes\\"" to the \\""is this security the same as\\"" question.  The security price history is not available from the edit security form.<br /><br />1-5-2013 Bug in Q2013 (not reported to Quicken):<br />Randomly getting message ''The resulting value is too big.<br /> Please enter it as more than one transaction.''<br />Has occurred both during security entry transaction and during CTRL+Z recalculate. (CLK T A/C JKM DB)<br />I also get ''Do you want specific identification of lots?'' for BUY transactions (LJK T A/C JKM DB)<br /><br />I have reported most of the above to Quicken (except 1-5-2013), but I suspect the information never reaches the Development Team."
3,it's dose what I need it to do.
4,Installation was very smooth with no problems.  Some thoughtful improvements and fixes in this latest release.  Previous bugs with One Step Update communicating and downloading from banks are much improved.  Download performance is also faster.
4,"Great software! Like many of you I had been using TurboTax for years but their recent changes prompted me to give H&R Block (formerly TaxCut) another look. The software was just as easy to use for my situation as TurboTax was. I had regular income, investment income, mortgage deductions, and rental property and the Premium edition handled it all fine.<br /><br />As an added bonus H&R Block offers a 10% refund bonus that can be applied to a large amount of store gift cards if you so choose. TurboTax offers something similar but last time I used it you could only get an Amazon gift card. So if you are into the bonus thing H&R Block has a lot more options such as restaurants, retail stores, etc."
0,They are selling you the trial! Dont waste your money! Not right to do that! and not able to get a refund.

0,"I have been a loyal user of Quicken and Turbo Tax from the very beginning.....I can't even count all the years. Last year I was very disappointed because Intuit chose to have different features in the online vs the CD version of the program. This year they took the unbelievable step to remove capital gains/Schedule D from Deluxe. They seem to forget that they are \\""competing\\"" with other companies products and can't simply provide less features and hope that no one notices, or that people will not abandon their product for a superior experience from another provider.  I along with the masses am very angry at this....enough to consider moving away from Intuit simply on principle.....    So here is my challenge to them, if they backtrack on their policy and reinstate Deluxe features to what they have had in the past by the middle of January, then I will stay with TT. If not, there is absolutely no question that they have lost me as a customer, probably forever. And make no mistake, I am basically the technical nerd in my family and group (like a lot of these reviewers probably are), a lot more people than just myself are going to get an earful about this.....Think carefully Intuit......    Update: 12-29.....So I decided to take up Bob Meighan's (Turbotax VP) offer to call his team (800-445-1875) and I will admit that I am satisfied with the outcome of the conversation.....for this year. I had a frank conversation with the gentleman on the phone that because of their response this year, I will stay with them. However, I suggested that they think very carefully about what their strategy will be for next year. I do not have any problem with any business attempting to find ways to generate \\""reasonable\\"" profit. However, they are competing with other products and do not stand alone. They need to consider that carefully...."
0,"I have worked with Publisher 2007 and Microsoft Office products for years and have always been satisfied with the product.  I downloaded this when we bought a new computer.  There has never been (I mean NEVER) a time that while I was working on my weekly project that the software hasn't crashed.  It stops working and if I don't remember to save every time I've made a change, the information is lost. I have searched their help information and even posted the problems on their blog, to no avail.<br /><br />I cannot believe that Microsoft put their name on this product. I am very disappointed and will hesitate in the future to invest in Microsoft Office products."
1,Very limited in what you can do I like the old version much better (Printmaster Gold). I would not recommend this product.
0,"Okay.  MicroSoft needs a new CEO to shake things up.  They have lost their minds up there in Redmond.  They captured two generations of computer users on MS Office, and easily could have the third.  Instead, they pull Office into some \\""360\\"" pay-as-you-go solution and combine it with SkyDrive and Skype.  Office should be cheaper, better, and faster.  It is technology for cryin' out loud!  Instead, they make it less user friendly, can't use it on your new computer if your old one goes belly up because of Windows problems.  Enough already.  Keep Office as a great product, which it is, and stop combining it with the crap hardly anyone wants.<br /><br />Office should NOT (Repeat, NOT) be a subscription service.  Sell it as a download that can be used on three computers for about $100.  That's a fair deal.  $100 per year for all the headache you cause with this 360 crap is not fun.<br /><br />My Jr. High students do not have $100 to spend every year on your software.  Hello Openoffice.  MS you just lost another customer."
0,"Horrible ... my older version was a snap to use ... had to update from XP to 7, and the old print shop would not work ... still looking for something else - purchased Print Shop Deluxe 3.5, now this CD disc makes a nice indoor frisbee - however, I my old version is still on my old computer, so, using thumb drivers, I can use the old version, than transfer the finished project to the new Windows 7 computer."

0,"Turbo Tax had bad reviews, so I bought into the 'Get Your Billions Back, America' marketing campaign and decided to try H&R Block.  This software doesn't ask any questions like Turbo Tax does...  It simply takes you through a digitized tax form where you fill in the values line by line.  Why would I pay to do that when I could just get the form for free from the post office.  I purchased this for help with understanding the taxes, and not ending up with a ton of errors.  In the end, H&R block will give you a list of your errors, but they give this to you at THE END of all of your work.  Just so you can go through and try to understand what you got wrong.  Turbo Tax actually notifies you of the error when you make it so you can adjust and move on.  H&R will be giving me my money back!  I'm sending in my receipt for a full refund!"
2,"If you download a copy of this software for use on a computer running Mountain Lion, you'll have to follow a relatively complex series of steps in order to make the application run properly. The troubleshooting steps may be found by searching the following in Google \\""Rosetta Stone (v.4.1.15) Error 8111 under Mountain Lion\\"" and going to the Apple Discussion Community link. I personally found these steps to be a fairly significant barrier to entry, but others may be more savvy with computers. Once you go through these steps, you will still have to chat with Rosetta Stone to activate the product because, as other users have flagged, Rosetta Stone does not accept activation keys that are provided through third-party vendors like Amazon."
3,It did the job getting my pc back to working status
3,"Very powerful app, especially considering price. Does just about everything I want yo do. Could be a little more intuitive, but good."
3,"Still need to figure out some features.  The program is very good but it is extremely not user-friendly as far as being able to pass along documents to someone who doesn't have that particular version.  That can be very expensive depending on what your needs are.  That said, it does keep records organized and reports are ready at the touch of a finger.  I am used to an older version and am anticipating this newer version to be even better as far as features."
4,"Very reliable Internet security sofware, light and complete... 3 PC fully protected. Only took 20 minutes to donwload the sofware, put the code that amazon sends and you are ready to go. Great and simple!"
2,"Adobe Photoshop Element 11 - is what I ordered and thought I was downloading but after it was downloaded, Element 10 was written at the top.  I called and spoke to someone at Amazon and he said to uninstall this version and then go to the link he had emailed me and I would get to talk to someone in Adobe directly.  .  The last time I dealt with Adobe, it took two and a half days to resolve the problem with time, money and tension mixed in.  I need Adobe tonight so have to use what I received.  I don't know how different Element 11 is from Element 10 - maybe no different.  However, it is not what I ordered and I shouldn't have to try to correct the problem myself. I don't have the time. That's why I order from Amazon because it is usually quite a simple and easy process.  What can you do so that I will be a happy customer in the future?<br />Mariana Titus"
4,Works great!
3,Quicken Home & Business 2015 is very comprehensive but somewhat cumbersome to use.
4,"If your operating budget is tight, but you want to make sure payroll is done correctly, this is the way to go.  The tax tables are all updated for you, you can provide your employees with direct deposit, tax forms are pre-filled for you, and electronic submission is easy.  You do have to keep track of the tax deadlines, but as long as you are in your QB once a month it's easy to check that also."
2,It's okay
2,it's turbo tax online ... nuff said
4,"Great product I have it installed on several computers.  It is worth the price, free is always good no great"
4,I bought this after watching a workshop on photography workflow. Previously I used Bridge + Adobe Camera Raw. I've grown to really enjoy how attuned this software is to the digital photography workflow.<br /><br />The digital option is great and remember that you can install this on up to 2 different computers and switch between the two. So I can keep my photos and Lightroom catalog on a portable HDD and work on them when I have spare time at work (hardly) or stay late at the office.
1,"Had to update to this one when we got our new Windows 8 HP desktop since Quicken 2008 (which ran perfectly on our old Windows Vista) would no longer run profit and loss statements (???) on Windows 8.<br />OMG. What a nightmare... I have NO idea why this wouldn't run properly - I can't even tell you the hours I spent with tech support (the WORST WORST WORST) - our biz checking acct opened fine but our personal acct would not open(!).... I 'think' the data conversion got messed up when it converted our files from 2008 to 2014.... After a few weeks of tearing my hair out, I finally found a fix on a non-Intuit site, BUT first, I installed Quicken 2014 on a DIFFERENT, Windows 7 computer and started all over. It just would NOT work on my Windows 8, although I don't really think it was a Widows 8 issue : &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; Here's what I tried from the fix I found:  &#34;First, try using Quicken's Copy feature to copy the entire file. However, when the damage is present in transactions (rather than in the category/transfer/class lists, memorized transactions, and so forth), it can be identified and isolated by copying specific parts of the file.  In the damaged file, make a copy specifying the origin date of the file as one month prior to today. The copy will contain all but last month's transactions.  If there is no corruption found in the copy, then the damage is limited to last month's transactions. However, you will need to reenter them in the copy.  If the copied file is still damaged, repeat the copy procedure removing one month at a time until the damaged area is identified.&#34;<br />FINALLY, it's working as it should. If there was another program that did what Quicken does, I would have JUMPED SHIP."
2,"I have been a loyal TurboTax customer since the early 90s.  But evidently, that doesn't matter at all to Intuit.  While I usually purchased the Home and Business edition, I didn't think I needed it this year, as I closed my business.  But I purchase Deluxe, and find I need Sch D.  No problem, says Intuit...we can upgrade you for a mere $30. (see pic)  But then I go online to their site, and they offer the Premier Ed. for only $20 more than Deluxe.  (see pic)  Sooo....what's the deal Intuit?  Do you PUNISH your loyal customers for $10 for picking the wrong version?  That's a great way to retain customers!  You really screwed the pooch this time.   EDIT: After contacting Intuit (took 30 min on hold) they agreed to upgrade for free.  That process was painless, at least.  2 more stars and they just might keep me as a customer."
4,HANDS DOWN....Loved their Free Edition and paid one even more....No problems since I installed it.  Good AV  for all computers....
1,"I have tried to install this new version of Office today on the new computer that I bought at Amazon also, and cannot seem to get it to work, it keeps on asking me to &#34;repair&#34; it. I do not know what is wrong as this is the first time that I have trouble with an Office product. I have tried to repair it online and also on the quick way, to no avail. What could be wrong? And if I delete it I may not be able to get it reinstalled!"
2,Is what it is. Gets the job done. Nothing special but equally no disappointments
2,"Being a 32 bit offering, little about this software is professional as alluded to by the title \\""Pro 6\\"", and wasted purchase.<br /><br />i) No preference setting to prevent Sketchbook Pro 6 from connecting with the Autodesk server each time the program is started.<br /><br />ii) There are no local help files, program help information being available only through the web.<br /><br />iii) Annoying, image blocking blue and grey, want to be like Apple dial interface, once an area of an image has been selected.

3,"I love Turbo tax, more than Tax Cut which I have also used a few times.  This year, however, the IRS is rejecting my tax return because the &#34;EIN# is incorrect&#34;.  Well, the EIN number is the same as last year, nothing has changed. The spelling of the business name also has not changed.<br />I saw on some professional accounting software a way to override the check that is done, Turbo Tax & the IRS should allow you to do this after your return is rejected 3X by the IRS.<br />I see a lot of other people have the same problem, Turbo tax and the IRS need to work together to get this right.  I would give five stars, but I had to file a paper return this year, delaying my return an extra month."
1,"If this is your first time to use a personal accounting software, go for it, but if you are using Quicken 2010 or 2011, skip this one. I've been using Quicken since 1991, upgrading every 2 or 3 years, and this is the buggiest, slowest version yet. Intuit added the ability to use larger fonts and, um, well, other than more bugs and more time waiting for your updates to complete, that's about all you get for your money. I hate to say it, but I feel ripped off."
1,"I've been a Quicken user since 1999 and this is the worst update I've seen. There where do many little glitches with the presentation that it felt like an early beta version. For an established brand releasing a product with so many obvious flaws really damages their credibly. Thankfully many of the issues have been addressed in the seven releases since launch, but not without frustrating many long time customers and dampening the loyalty Quicken had enjoyed."
4,I love this software it is so easy to use. i'd recommend to all my friends. so easyn to use.
0,"After upgrading to Mountain Lion, I discovered that my version of Quicken was no longer supported. So I purchased Quicken Essentials, which is the only Quicken option available for the OS. It is terrible and an insult to Mac users. The reports are awful. This is hands down the worst software I have ever purchased. Going to switch to iBank, hope I can import my old Quicken data."
0,"UPDATE 4: I give up.  After months of frustration I've decided to throw in the towel.  Now all Corel does is load and not allow me to do anything.  Everything I click gives an error beep.  I have no interest in seeing if the latest version fixes anything because the version I paid for never really worked at a usable level.  PhotoShop, PhotoShop Elements, gimp, Serif PhotoPlus are much more viable alternatives to use.  It's so sad that such a great product was ruined by a company that puts ZERO care into their work.  Corel should just kill this product or sell it to competent developers.  I'm uninstalling this and never turning back.<br /><br />UPDATE 3: Despite the adware (which I believe the complaints might have reduced), I decided to try to work with this.  I really think that it's sad that a piece of software that has been around for years and has been put up as a commercial PhotoShop competitor runs much more slow than its open source counterpart.  The UI may be better but all the loading and waiting kills that benefit.  I'm going to try to see if I can deal but at this moment, I'm actually starting to appreciate the lightweight nature of GIMP.  By the way, I switched to PaintShop Pro back in the day because PhotoShop was such a huge hog!  How ironic!<br /><br />UPDATE 2: I'm sorry, I just had to add that I think it's really low class for software that I *PAID* for to have embedded popup ads in it!  If you want to advertise in software GIVE IT FOR FREE!  I had written the review before receiving two popup ads.  I'm sorry this is unacceptible!  I lowered the ranking one point as a result.<br /><br />UPDATE 1: I found a way to mitigate the sluggishness of the navigator.  If you only stick to using the &#34;Computer&#34; tab in the navigator and don't catalog any of your images, the performance is okay.  Even so, the navigator is still pretty bad.  For instance, in the image viewer, there is no way to get to the editor.  You have to exit the viewer than right-click the image in the explorer instead.  That's just bad... REALLY bad.  I've also found that X6 can be default to open directly in Edit mode.  While not ideal, it is a step forward.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />The reason I ranked it three is because while the editor itself has improved, the navigator is just as dog slow as it has been since X3.  It is 100% useless.  The idea is that you're supposed to be able to bookmark folders in the navigator that  you can access quickly for editing and other tasks.  However, the execution of this idea is so pathetic they should have not even bothered.<br /><br />This software could be five-star but the bloatware really brings it down two notches.  An ideal product would be just the editor and all of it's features alone without this albatross of bad software it is burdened to carry.  If removing the navigator were an install option, I'd gladly welcome it.<br /><br />Now the editor itself has really improved like I said.  If you saw my X4 review, I had said that the context menus made absolutely no sense and the UI was designed by rank amateurs.  This version appears to have addressed my earlier complaints.  While not ideal, the menus are more sensible and contexts properly applied.  The toolset is pretty sharp, I LOVE adjustment layers, and overall I'm impressed with the improvement on the edit side.  Unfortunately, the excess baggage of the Navigator (Manage Tab) weighs it down.  Just avoid it at all costs.  I really wish there was a way to just rip it out.  It's just that horrible.<br /><br />To be honest the real reason I bought this was that the price was low enough (thirty) to take the risk given that the previous versions were horribly bad.  I was also getting tired of using the kludgy interface of GIMP.  The extras like FaceFilter and Perfectly Clear add to the value of the package but I would not pay much more than what I paid for it.<br /><br />So in a nutshell here's why you buy PaintShop Pro X6:<br /><br />1)Tired of the GIMP UI<br />2) Adjustment layers<br />3) Heavy discount<br /><br />The bottom line is what price you're willing to pay to not have to deal with GIMP's quirks.  You can get just about the same quality of image editing out of GIMP but some of its quirks are pretty unbearable.  PaintShop Pro eliminates that burden at the cost of heavy bloat.  Although it's not as bloated as PhotoShop the mother of all bloatware.lling to pay to not have to deal with GIMP's quirks.

3,"Just ordered & downloaded Quicken Home & Business.<br />I'm a long time Quicken fan and decided it was time to bring order back into my finances.<br />The download went quickly, and setting up the accounts was very easy.  Quicken seems to have taken a page out of Turbo Tax's book in terms of ease of use.<br /><br />It's a great program and I look forward to keeping my finances in order once again.<br />Buy it, you won't regret it."
3,Had to alter some settings on computer to make work. after that piece of cake
1,"Very simple, user oriented interface, but lacks in encoding. When encoding from MKV or MP4 video quality seems to suffer when creating DVDs, and also had issues with the programming dropping frames (causing stuttering or jumping) with the same files.<br /><br />The program was widely suggested, but it seems that i will still be on the lookout for a better DVD authoring program."
2,After I installed it and saw what it was  about I uninstalled it and forgot about it. didn<br />t see much use for it
3,I had Creative Media on computer when I bought it.  I liked the play features but when I recorded music I got alot of clicks.  So I purchased the Toolbox with MP3 converter to see if that was the problem.  Toolbox does remove the clicks but only for the songs that are playing.
2,"The biggest problem I have with this software is that it conflicts with the Mac's Time Machine program. This has gone on for years now and it's very annoying. The  tax program always asks if you want to check for updates (and there always are some) and that's where the problem is. The updater simply won't work correctly when Time Machine is running and will stay 'stuck' forever. I have to dismount my Time Machine drive in order to proceed with the program update. This has gone on for at least 3 years. I think it's time that H&R dealt with this! The other annoying thing this year was the program trying to sell me things. Other than these issues, I have no problem with the tax aspect of the software. I will be back next year, if only because I dislike Intuit so much."
3,Everything I was looking for related to the Office and Excel program. It helped me just like the quicken program somewhat.
4,"I have been using Turbo Tax since the 1980's.  Never had any issues any way I purchased the product.  Unless they stop making it, I won't stop using it.  No problems at all with the download for my Mac running on Mountain Lion."
2,"It still has too many loop-holes, the worst being that when you get stuck, there is no one to call or write except others who are using the same product, and most of the time that is a joke."
2,you said it was not as good as you would have liked I AGREE you said next year would be better plase make it easy as you have in the past I LOOK FORWARD to the new (old easy) for next year.  I worked in IT for just over 40 years and even when I tried to make everything I did EXCELENT!! It did not turn out that way and I had to make it RIGHT That is what you did this year! I will be back next year and the next year etc!!! This year turned out good any way!!!!
4,"Easy to download, easy to use . .been using Turbo Tax since 2004 . .keeps getting better and more refined each year"
4,My PC had been compromised by unwanted visitors.  Some elements of my previously-installed Microsoft Outlook did not function.  This 2010 Outlook works perfectly.
2,Takes some practice
4,"I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative to the other internet security software out there.  The user interface for this program is very easy to work with and configure to your needs.  The program frequently updates to combat known threats and viruses; typically once every day or so.  The add on features that work with your browser of choice are also a nice feature, it adds to the protection and protects from hidden threats that may be present on a website."
2,"NOT Amazon's problem. Intuit screwed up and has admitted as such. In previous years, this version contained the most basic business Schedule C and two other business forms. Without warning Intuit removed them. DO NOT PURCHASE this version if you have any business expenses. Again. DO NOT PURCHASE this version. If you do accidentally purchase this version and need a Schedule C, go to Intuit's site, do an upgrade to Home & Business, then follow the procedures to get a $25 rebate for the trouble for being forced to upgrade because of their unannounced change to their product.  Schedule C business issue aside, Turbo Tax continues to be, what I believe a superb product. I have used it without issue for years."
2,"I have a macbook pro and was able to open my document from \\""textedit\\"" with this product.  It changed some formatting but everything was there.  The icons help to figure out how to use it.  The pros--it's free, able to do most of the functions that word does (from my PC) and is fairly intuitive.  The cons--I can't figure out how to insert a picture or object and move it around on the document.  I don't see anything like wordart or some of the other functions that word has that I often use.<br /><br />I'm not going to keep it, because of the need for inserting lots of photos and graphics, but if I were simply using it for reports, I think it would work well for me."
2,Customer service:<br />- no response to my question to the community.<br />- chat service waiting time too long and then the chat box does not work in Chrome and Firefox. Not sure if it's because of my setting or whatever. No way to find out.<br /><br />Tax filing: does not guide how to input non W2 income from foreign countries. I need to spend so long time for trial and error.
0,"My computer STOPS COMPLETELY and won't even re-bute! I have to Unplug it<br />and try to start again. I Need a Good Security System. I'd like to return this, but I've<br />put it on my 3 computers, 2 lap tops and 1 desktop, and I'm Messed UP!<br />I HATE THIS SYSTEM!"
2,"What everyone should really care about is not what Intuit is charging for the software, but what the f government is &#34;charging&#34; us for WORKING, for having a JOB, or a BUSINESS....all this outrage at Intuit, while your Big Brother, Uncle Sam has you upside down by the ankles, shaking us all out!!!<br /><br />I don't like the new pricing policy either, but with this type of product, it is how they are making up for the 25%+ inflation we have experienced in retail stores, neatly HIDDEN in the size reductions of products we buy: the prices have stayed the same, but quantities have been drastically reduced!!! Hasn't anybody noticed? A half gallon of ice cream no longer exists, they now sell only 1.5 liter packages, and what used to be a 16oz can of coffee is now only 12 ounces, while the 3 pound can can only be found at Costco, in the market the &#34;large&#34; size is now only 28 to 34 ounces! (A 3 lb can was 48 ounces). There are countless other example of massive inflation being disguised that I'm sure you have all seen, like OJ, but the above examples should suffice. This is what happens when your rulers print over 3 Trillion fake dollars!!!<br /><br />Intuit has done what all businesses are doing, hiding the massive inflation that is due to come by offering less product for the same money! Get used to it, believe me, we are all in BIG trouble!"
4,"Works well for me, been using it about 8 years now.  Thanks!"
0,Cannot connect to Cloud Drive. OSX 10.10.3
3,Product was easy to set up and use.  It saved a huge amount of time getting my new computer up and running.  I had to do very little tweaking after I used PCMover.  Would definitely use it again.  It's worth it's price many times over!
3,"I downloaded H&R Block software from the Amazon site for tax season this year. The price was better than I found anywhere else and the download was simple and straight forward, both great things and mush appreciated. When I started my tax return however the software would not permit the latest site updates required to retrieve the most current Federal and Stata tax forms. I tried to contact the seller with no luck.  I later contacted H&R Black tech help and was eventually sent a new software download that did work as advertised. I have used H&R Block software for years and will llikely continue to do so. I have tried other software, TurboTax etc. and I prefer H&R block for tax returns that require itemized deductions. Moral of the story as you can save some money but do not wait until the 11th hour to download or you could add some unwanted stres to your tax return excersize."
0,"So far out of the gate, it is terrible.  I installed the software, that went fine.  I did the registration, again, good to go.  Then when it opened, it told me there was an upgrade, did I want to install it?  I said yes, the upgrade failed with a &#34;could not open file error&#34; and the only choice that worked was abort.  After that, the software crashed, was not stable, could not run my blu-ray.  Every time I now  open the software, it kept asking for the registration (which failed now even though it had worked before).  I went to un-install/reinstall the software, but there is no uninstall in the windows programs applet (what software manufacturer does not put an un-install in there now days?!?!?)  I have opened a support case with the Manufacturer, but there is no support number, only email support so I am not thinking they are going to be able to help much.  I think this is lousy software.  If the Manufacturer helps, I will change my review but for now DONT BUY IT."
1,"Extremely difficult to install,especially since the instructions don't work."
1,"i've used turbo and h&r.  this year at a friends advice i tried tax-cut.  at first i was annoyed at all the detailed questions as it seemed more difficult to use but after using side-by-side w/ H&R block i was left w/ a sense of a much more complete interview and a much more detailed tax return.  though the amounts calculated by the two packages were the same, the taxcut included much more detail as to income and also provided an automatic itemizer/calculator for non-cash deductions which was MUCH easier than that which I used from h&r and which have paid extra for in the past.  do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
1,"No. The data conversion from windows to apple, didn't work as expected! I will stick to windows quicken for now, umtil i find a good alternative!!"
1,"Purchased this to install on several of my new work computers which have a different McAfee program on purchase, but term had expired.  Program would not install, even after I uninstalled the prior version of McAfee.  Customer support was able to install for me, but it took a good hour for just 1 computer.  now trying to install on a second laptop and same problem again.  Looking back I've had issues installing McAfee software on other computers in the past, and I had switched to Kaspersky - was a breeze to install.  Should have done Kaspersky again, but the price was good and I thought things would be better now.  I'm a fool for thinking that way.  Not willing to spend another hour with customer support, so I'm going to go back to Kaspersky or some other competitor.  Hopefully I can get my money back."
4,What it is: A personal video editing and converting suite.  This is my go-to product for format conversions or quick edits.  The price is unbeatable for the value!<br /><br />What it is not: This is not a fully-featured video editing product - do not expect this to help you edit that professional DVD.
2,"Apparently TurboTax for Mac users has many issues this year, my first year using my new Mac.  To begin with, I had to re-enter all of my info from last year and personal info that should have been stored with my account.  This is my 8th year using this product and first time having issues.  I was told I did not purchase the product last year that saves your info, you would have had to upgrade last year.  Then, went I went to file, I got error messages telling me to to print and file by snail mail.  This went on for two hours, with me trying all different things to fix it and working with others on forums (still getting emails from forum people having same problem) and waiting on hold on TurboTax Customer Service.  Finally, not sure what happened after I turned my system off and walked away for the third time in frustration, it just worked.  My refund came quickly after that."
4,I have used Intuit products for years but I quit trying to use the old MAC versions of Quicken as I could not get them to work from a Windows conversion (my data goes back to about 1997).  Got off on a bad start with the new MAC 2015 trying to convert from Windows 2013 and was actually ready to request a refund. I kept getting an error code 2000 (but found that it was totally my fault). I eventually I got it figured out and now everything is running smoothly. I'm still learning some of the reports and functions and there are a few things that I miss from my Windows version but I'm sure there will be updates that will add new features to this new Mac 2015 program. It is light years over their previous MAC versions! This year I plan on using the MAC version of Turbo Tax to see if it works as well as the Windows version that I have been using for over 20 years.
2,"I am primarily a PC user and have worked with QuickBooks Pro for over 14 years. However, two of my clients are adamant about using their Macs, so I bought the Mac version to get with their program. It's different,but it works. . .it's just no where near as robust a product in terms of functionality. I am getting used to it, but the one essential thing it lacks is the &#34;accountant's copy&#34;, and the work around suggested by Intuit is ridiculous. Given the size and resources of Intuit I am surprised that the two version are not more similar."
3,"A product that does what it promises!  It used to be without self-promoting ads, but we're stuck with them.  Dependable."
4,Excellent. Used it for final exam for HR block course and got it all right before I used there own corporate system
4,great love it
0,"I have been using Turbo Tax since the 90's.  I am very disappointed that Turbo Tax has become a GREEDY MERCHANT.  I always purchased TurboTax Deluxe because that version included Schedule C and I am homeowner.  This year since the interest on my home is not enough for itemization I made the decision to use Turbo Tax online (which I discovered wasn't that much of a savings in cost).  Although, I was informed that since I did not purchase the software this year I was not eligible for the refund \\""quite understanding\\"" I am still very disappointed with the new Deluxe Version of TurboTax because I convinced many of my friends to purchase it, not knowing it had changed.      I hate I did not read the reviews prior to completing my taxes with TurbTax online."
2,It wasn't broken so .......just to get more money from us!
4,Good product for a nice price
4,I think its the Best Cloud out there. One fee and unlimited storage.
2,"I did an upgrade from Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 to version 12.  There are difference.  I don't like all of them.  One feature I used quite a bit in version 10 was the ability to make fine adjustments in color balance of my images.  That has disappeared from version 12.  Or, at least, if it is still there I have not found it.  All in all....I wish I had saved my money.  Another feature I can no longer find is the ability to select the color management profile I want to use.  Again....perhaps it is still there and I have just not found it's new location.  These software companies love to move things around for no apparent reason."
4,Turbo Tax great as ever
3,"it did all I needed it for, I think. price was good, easy to use. easy to install, all good."
1,Very Buggy. No Support
0,"I know this post most likely will not be read by anyone of importance with quickbooks and even if it were would they do anything to change.  I have been tasked with purchasing accounting software for my wifes newly formed law practice.  She asked me to look into quickbooks.<br /><br />Ok, after reading numerous reviews here I consider it looked into and passed over.  I haven't ever used quickbooks but this is exactly the kind of company I avoid doing business with.  The kind that lock you into something and then focus on trying to wring every cent they can out of you.  No thanks Quickbooks."
4,Light and efficient. My computer works well and remains fast.
0,Did not use software waisted my money. Terms and conditions are invasion of privacy.
2,easy to use and quick return. we always use turbo tax
1,"REVIEW UPDATE (Nov 5, 2014):  Updating from 1 star to 2 stars  So after the day 1 registration debacle I was able to get into the application.  My first impression was that this was more of the same.  It seems to respond faster than the 2014 version but Intuit still doesn't place a high value on \\""complete quality\\"".  The only new feature they offered was the credit score and I have yet to see that since there is a server error every time I try (skip this and use Credit Karma for free).  Not all my accounts are connecting for updates so they have some work there- I expected this and will offer a temporary pass.  The R3 update was pushed from Intuit and as usual it didn't automatically find my Quicken file- a restart resolved this but it's just another example in a list of many software quality woes.    If my accounts all update in the next week or so and I see a stable product I'll update my rating to a mediocre 3 stars.  It seems like this one will be worth updating to from the 2013/14 versions in the next few months.  I'm an early adopter of everything so I have some patience but if you're looking for a hassle free experience you should wait until R4 or R5.      When I get to use this software I'll update the rating and these comments.    Step one, uninstall 2014.  Step two, install 2015.  Step three, register.  FAIL.    Or should I say \\""OOPS!\\""  Some sort of registration error is blocking me and seemingly every other new user and upgrader from accessing the application...and their data.    So while I'd like to give you a review, I'll just say you're better off pouring molten lava on your personal finance files- at least it would be a story worth telling."
1,"First, I should share that my purchase of Office 2013 was not done with 'disposable' income. That is, my purchase was a must-have after I lost my Office software when following MS guidelines to resolve a connection issue. (Not a good day . . . I'm not an IT tech & resent the need to be one to stay with the times). I chose Offfice 2013 over 2010 because I needed it fast & while 2010 online version was available, it was more expensive than 2013 so why not buy the latest version? Well, I find Outlook 2013 to be overkill! That is, it has so many unnecessary bells & whistles that it is killing my productivity as I wade through all the hype to do the simplest tasks. Also, the look is bland & too busy."
4,"We get this every year and have never, knock on wood ;), has a problem.  With all the spam and hackers out there, you need some form of this on every system."
2,I have had no problems with the new app on Win7 64 bit.  Its rather basic but it does work and I have had NO disconnects or could not connect problems.  Its been very solid.  The speed is slower up then down most providers limit up speed to 10mbs/1MBs.
0,"I purchased Microsoft Office at Amazon in good faith and then was transferred to Microsoft for the download.  When I tried to download, I was informed that the download is not available in my region of the world.  Now I'm stuck with a product key but no way to receive the product.  I tried to cancel the order with Amazon, but that option does not exist.  I'm out my money with nothing to show for it!"
1,"I had been using Tax Cut for several years now, tried Turbo Tax this year.  it was very difficult to work through the small business / house rental portion of the software.  Generally harder to navigate than Tax Cut, generally didn't like the interface.  Trying to work moving expenses into the software left me frustrated and confused.  I will switch back to Tax Cut next year."
0,THIS IS A TOTAL RIP OFF I THOUGHT THIS WAS A SOFTWEAR PROGRAM THAT SHOWS YOU HOW TO WRITE SHORT STORIES BUT ALL THIS IS A TRAP TO GET PARENTS TO BUY MORE SOFTWEAR FOR THE KIDS.

0,"Note: Quicken user for 10+ years...this latest version is a horror story...<br /><br />If I could give negative stars I would. I have been running Quicken 2012 Premier and tried (for three HOURS) with tech support to get this to install. Intuit says I have a problem with my .NET Framework...go through several iterations of repairing, installing, etc....only to find that there is a known installation problem. I am on Windows 7 and had been running .NET Framework 4.5.1 successfully. Intuit rolls me back to version 4.0...still won't install and I am unceremoniously told to contact Microsoft. Unacceptable on many, many levels. The only Intuit support option is via chat and guess what? You have to restart your computer to uninstall/re install .NET versions....so back to square 1. I have been seeing the Update nag screen for months only to find that in September 2014, Quicken 2014 is unusable. No word from Intuit on a refund, or the offer of media that has the required files for installation.<br /><br />Update + 6 HOURS....still won't install. No one at Intuit will let me know if their full versions (media) contain the flavor of .NET that will allow installation.<br /><br />Being a near monopoly in the personal finance software market makes this doubly painful. I have wasted a full day trying to buy an  update<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />Update + 2 Days: Wiped .NET Framework off my computer totally using a tool on Microsoft Knowledge Base. Downloaded and installed  latest .NET Framework. Then in order to get Quicken to install I had to force it to run in Windows XP SP3 Compatibility mode (this is a KNOWN issue with Quicken 2014 on Windows 7), and as an Administrator. Finally installed....conversion was fairly painless...and guess what? NOTHING  was earth shatteringly new except the mobile app, which I have been advised to stay clear of because the cloud sync is not reliable.<br /><br />If Intuit monitors these comments...please don't release software with installers that do not contain ALL the files it needs to run the application. You are getting shoddy in your development and nearly useless in product support.<br /><br />-------------------<br />UPDATE 9/24<br /><br />Faced with losing the ability to download transactions in 2015 I upgraded Premier 2012 to Premier 2014. From the outset this \\""upgrade\\"" has been a disaster. First, the software would not install without an extreme work around for Windows 7. After finally installing the update I started getting download error messages -- Quicken Chat Support had me deactivate and re-activate all 20 of my accounts. This caused duplicate transactions and countless errors in reconciling already reconciled accounts. Finally -- last three days -- NO transactions have been downloaded from any of my financial institutions. I spent three hours with Chat Support until the support person gave up and said my issue would be escalated...it has not been escalated and I have had ZERO assistance from Intuit. Program is now useless with over 10 years of data hanging in the balanceds to run the application.

1,"Ooooh, teacher/student discount.  Not true.  My husband found this at a Staples for $80.  Way to go, folks.  I feel cheated now, especially after having to go through the hoops to prove that I am a teacher.  And, they keep changing it so much that you have to relearn so many things.  Also, it automatically rotates the photo but doesn't rotate it in the original file, even after saving.  Am I happy?  Not so much."
4,The new UI is much cleaner and easier to use than the previous version.  The online sync process also seems like it works faster and easier.<br /><br />thanks

0,"I was forced to upgrade from Quicken 2011 to Deluxe 2014.  Now that it's installed, I can't use it.  The font is so small on the side account list, yet in the register it is GIGANTIC!  I spent over 30 minutes with customer service doing a ridiculous trouble shooting exercise and when nothing worked, I was told that it was a &#34;known issue&#34; and they are working on it.  They will be sending a patch in 5-7 business days.  Seriously, this product has been out for months as has Windows 8.1.  How can this be on the market if it's unusable?  So now I don't have a working version of the software and I am out $50 for useless nonsense.  So....I am going to dispute this charge with my credit card company if it isn't fixed.  There is absolutely no way that I am going to pay for this nonsense."
4,"Easy install and setup.  Good security features, including website specific verification.  Still working with the mobile security feature for best performance.  Overall, very satisfied so far with this product."
2,"could be better, 3.5 stars"
0,"I purchased the 2010 simple start program and needed to upgrade to the pro 2012 for exporting and importing reasons but reading the reviews on here has helped my decision to not purchase it. I just wanted to say thanks to everyone on here for reviewing this product and giving us small business owners a heads up on this rotten company and their money grabbing efforts. Intuit you just lost my business because of the reviews on amazon, this should be a wake up for you to fix what the people are saying. Just read the reviews and fix them, stop charging for services that should be included like payroll. Give the people what they need and you will sell more products. My transition to mobile based accounting has semi forced me out of the quickbooks and i honestly couldn't be happier, that's pretty bad to say about an accounting software!! I suggest if your a small business and need better software, its out there. Good luck intuit and to everyone out there, thanks."
2,Works OK - there are some features I would like to have.  I need Home and Business version but can't afford Intuit's prices for the upgrade.
2,"The federal program works easily and seemingly well. The state program for MS does not work so well. This year, our amended return put much of the information in the wrong spouse designation; I don't trust it. Last year, we got a penalty and interest from MS for our return completed with Turbo Tax.<br /><br />This year, we completed our taxes and paid for e-filing for both federal and state. When we went to file the state return, we were told that it could not be filed electronically. we could not determine how to get our money back and had to contact our credit card company to file an appeal.<br /><br />Help isn't always very helpful. The check your return part said we had 2 problems, then only identified 1."
3,Good
3,"Just be aware that if you already have your accounts on your computer you want to &#34;link&#34;, not &#34;add&#34; when updating.  Oops! :0/"
4,I use TurboTax every year.  Makes Taxes so much easier.  Especially helpful is the ability to import data from last year to save time.  And that it copies all the needed data for the state taxes for you.
3,I had an older HP scanner which was not supported under Windows 7 Home Premium. By moving to Windows 7 Professional I was able to use the Windows 7 Virtual Machine feature and run Windows XP as a virtual machine under Windows 7. With this setup I was able to continue using my scanner.
2,I always go with Norton to protect my software at home. Never lets me down. Keep me as a continuous customer.
1,"I'll spare you the details; however, 6 hours later I am still installing the Adobe Elements/Premiere 13 package.  When you use Adobe you are reverting to the old &#34;Control/Alt/Delete&#34; era.  Nothing is intuitive, nothing works as it should. The links Adobe provided after purchase did not function.  The PSE 13 would not install over the PSE 8 that I was running.  All crashed and had to be manually done.  The file download is MASSIVE, and the extraction process and installation is tedious.  You have to sit and authorize each action, nothing is automatic.  The only support is via &#34;chat&#34; to India, and you may be waiting an hour for a reply. Even after giving control of my screen to the Adobe tech person the programs could not be installed.  Adobe is pirate conscious, so I've signed into Adobe again about 25 times today during the install.  Jeez.  I only wanted Elements for the organizer function.  Having gone through the rather long learning curve to use Photoshop I am stuck with this system.  Actually, I may be phased out soon because Adobe is going to a monthly subscription system that is only justifiable for a business or professional.  Upgrading to Photoshop CS6 will cost me over 1500 dollars, and there likely will be no further upgrades after that, as it appears that Adobe is committed to the subscription model. This is no longer something that a hobbyist or prosumer photographer can really pursue.  This is a great business opportunity for somebody, and I am sure that Adobe is rapidly becoming a product for professionals and businesses.  I am using Picassa as my backup program and the storage of photos (in RAW!) on the Google system is very affordable compared to Adobe, and I am sure more secure.<br />I still enjoy Photoshop, enjoy the organizing capability and simple editing of Photoshop Elements, but I cannot imagine a more complicated install."
1,"Hardly improves each year, in fact sometimes gets worse. Absolutely awful customer support (and I'm not typically someone who needs or calls support). I just wasted 19 minutes and then 18 minutes trying to reach support over a second user license installation. The number the software gives as the *only* option to purchase a second license actually calls their online payroll team! They keep you on hold 10-15 minutes then pass you around. Both calls were eventually dropped. If they treat you like this when you call the number wanting to buy something, how do they treat you when you just want support?<br /><br />This is the best version for a small business or anyone that does accounting for more than one business. But you need only if there is no reasonable alternative.<br /><br />Intuit's competition is coming from the likes of xero and Freshbooks (cloud solutions). No business owner or their accountant in their right mind wants their financial data, details of all transactions, customers, prices paid, etc in the cloud with no way to prove security. Intuit do all they can to force you into their own cloud, or to backup into the cloud. They clearly don't get the needs of accountants, business owners or understand privacy. Or alternatively, perhaps they do understand the value of owning your data and they do all they can to force you to hand it over.<br /><br />Still missing: Features to *easily* track when use tax is owed on a purchase. This should be as simple as checking a box when entering a transaction. Yes there are ways to track it, but something needed by every business in most states shouldn't be so difficult or non-obvious."
2,Works well
1,"Some nice new features like one password login and update, but still got transaction download problems and cloud problems. Still use a UI that reminds me of windows 95 as far as font usage and control over windows sizes. Update window still takes over your screen and if you enlarge your font it is bigger then your screen and you cant even minimize it. Invoices and receipts interface still lacking ability's to customize the info you want the customer to see. Overall they did fix some issues but it is still not worth the price they are asking."
1,"Pros:<br />Cons:<br />I tried downloading transactions from my broker. There is no way to choose which ones to download. Then, apparently quicken cannot handled the number of transactions download and keep trying to match transactions. In the end I deleted the data file, restart and manually enter the transactions.<br /><br />If you enter a MiscExp in the register it won't be reflected in the linked cash account. You have to click the enter transaction button. Then the transaction can become MiscExpX and gets reflected in the linked cash account. This bug has existed for years.<br /><br />I mistakenly recociled an investment account with a linked cash account. It is not possible to remove the &#34;R&#34; status from a transaction. If I try in the cash account, it says to do it in the linked investment account. If I go to the investment account, there is no R status to edit.<br /><br />It looks like the Quicken team just haphazardly added some feature and called it a new version. That is what happens when there is no competition."
4,I like this software.
3,"pretty good.  Main thing I would like to see improved is how transactions are downloaded, I prefer the way the PC version isolated downloads and allows me to accept them.  I think the PC approach makes it easier to find all the downloads and make sure matches are made appropriately.  This then leads to a more accurate reflection of my balance."
4,"I used this to do my taxes and taxes of a relative who filed an extension.  My computer crashed and I could not locate the disk.  However I had saved the order info, contacted H & R block - and was able to download again...  Easy step by step tax prep.  I highly recommend."
3,"After all the negative reviews I downloaded with some trepidation - however, I have had no problems with the installation or usage, so far.  I am a long-time quicken user (back to the DOS days) and usually update every two or three years - this time from Quicken 2011. The installation included an immediate update to R10 and there were no problems in the process.  The mobile application appears to work fine - but is evidently a work-in-progress, since it has limited account coverage (banking only, no investments) and even more limited functionality. The one-step update also worked fine and had no problems with interaction with any of the multitude of financial institutions and various accounts in my system.  All-in-all, I have no problem recommending the new 2013 update to what is already a good program.  I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 because of the limited benefits of the mobile application at this time."
4,good
3,"Everything is good, keeps my computer safe without taking up too much processing power. However, the constant annoying notifications to upgrade and/or update the software makes it a bit of a pain."
0,If you can create an Excel or similar spreadsheet you don't need this product. Save your money for something useful.
0,"I could not file my return until March 20 due to a H&R Block software bug. H&R Block did not issue the bug fix until then. Since I ordered the software through Amazon, I have to write in to H&R Block to get a refund for the software, and that will take 4-6 weeks. This is after spending many hours on the phone with H&R Block product support for them to tell me to wait until March 20 for the bug fix. I will never work with H&R Block again."
0,everything says deluxe has one free state download then I find out you have to get the one that say deluxe plus state shame on you amazon for selling such a misleading product. H&R block is just a shady as turbo tax now I have to ay another 39 for state program its a RIP OFFF
0,"Really!? - You're still calling this a \\""DELUXE\\"" Version??? Well, I'm certainly not happy to see that the ability to efile with a K-1 (for Estates and Trust) has ALSO been removed from this year's Deluxe software. So after many years of using and supporting TT, I too am now debating if I will end up just forking over the additional $30 they are now demanding so I can efile a K-1, or has the time finally come to move on to some better featured, lower priced software."
0,"Corporate greed or ineptness or just plain stupidity, it really does not matter but someone, somewhere within turbo tax made some really bad decisions concerning this years tax software. I have returned my software to the store and now must choose a different software after so many loyal years with turbo tax. Sad, very sad, but goodbye turbo tax. You do not even deserve a one star rating but that is the lowest."
0,"I have been a satisfied customer of H&R Block's tax software since it was simply TaxCut.  Unfortunately, the program seems to have regressed.  Here are the major problems I encountered with this version:<br /><br />1) E-file could not be completed for business returns due to the K-1 bug previously mentioned.  Not only that, printed forms were watermarked with 'Draft' making physically filing with the work of the software impossible.<br /><br />2) H&R Block 2010 information did not import properly into 2011 for personal returns.<br /><br />3) Exchanging the .ATX file for a business return in H&R Block 2011 with a business partner resulted in errors.  We were unable to share the .ATX file.  These errors could not be resolved with numerous and lengthy support sessions with H&R Block customer service.  In the past, we were simply able to pass the ATX file between us for editing.<br /><br />4) On my personal return, adding two Schedule K-1s (owning multiple businesses) resulted in mysterious excess tax (large amount) regardless of reported income (I even fictitiously edited a second K-1 to show a loss instead of income and it still resulted in this increased tax).  I actually spent the time to input everything I had in 2011 back into the old 2010 version.  The 2010 version calculated things properly whereas 2011 included this mysterious tax.  Again, H&R Block customer service could not help resolve this.<br /><br />After encountering these issues, I switched to TurboTax.  TurboTax 2011 worked much better.  I was able to have multiple K-1s on my personal return, e-filing was no problem, and TurboTax imported my old H&R Block 2010 file better than H&R Block 2011 did.<br /><br />I am disappointed that H&R Block seems to have regressed."
4,"I downloaded this because I was having trouble playing newer blu ray discs on my older computer software. This fixed the problem! No issues with playback now, and the software is very easy to use. Highly recommended."
1,Bought It. Downloaded it. It crashed. Removed it to re-install. Now Amazon will not let me down load again.
4,I need this items
3,I needed to use my &#34;Word&#34; account and I couldn't until I got Office. I don't like to buy Office to get to my<br />Documents.
0,"This product was actually worthless for me. I bought it because my sound card and video cards aren't working properly, and on their website they claim to have diagnostic tests for these issues. Guess what the diagnostic test was? They played a sound and asked if I could hear it. When I said no, they were out of ideas. THEIR ENTIRE &#34;DIAGNOSTIC&#34; TEST WAS EXACTLY WHAT YOU CAN DO YOURSELF ON LITERALLY ANY APP, PROGRAM, OR WEBSITE THAT PLAYS SOUNDS.<br /><br />PCDoctor: Does sound come out?<br />Me: No<br />PCDoctor: Hahahahaha, then I can't help you. Sorry about your $20.00."
2,"I was on the phone last night with a tech support (based in India) and requested for a download for a software of Norton Internet Security 2012 because my laptop's external CD drive was not working. The store manager where I bought it told me that Norton will allow me to download it as long as I give my Product Key number. But when the offshore support guy was about to download the software, he started to twist my arm on buying a spyware product ($399.00...WTF?) and promised me to `clean' my computer. When I refused, he insisted and threatened to discontinue the download. Of course I refused his ridiculous offer and got disconnected.<br />This is a sad experience for me. I was already warned about this support guys from India, peddling other software outside of Norton products. This is a big black eye for Norton, they should be on top of their tech support guys specially if they are outsourced offshores."
1,"I was trying to find something less expensive than TurboTax for my LLC so I went with H&R Block.  This is an instance of \\""you get what you pay for\\"".  I was disappointed that I couldn't import my 2009 TurboTax information so I had to enter everything in again.  The interview process is awful, not very helpful.  I had last years return to help me, but if I was doing this from scratch I would be very worried that it wasn't done correctly.  It is basically an electronic form.  I can't speak to the personal returns as I didn't use them.  I will probably go back to TurboTax next year."
4,works great for the right price.
1,"Not what I was expecting, especially for the money."
3,"I had no problems downloading or installing this software.  Overall, it was easy to use.  I am a first year business owner in direct sales, so there was a lot of help with Schedule C.  Some of the directions were too vague, but helpful anyway.  I was able to prepare my state return, but it charges extra to e-file for state.  If you read in more detail you may catch that, but it could be misleading.  I just need to print and send.  I didn't want to spend the money for this, but it was much cheaper than seeing a CPA!"
4,"This is pretty awesome. I am taking notes for school at about 60 words a minute and able to do 17 pages of notes in 3-4 hours. Only complaint is if you have background noise and other people talking it seems to unlearn your speech a bit. The third day I will use it, I will for sure reset the microphone and see if that speeds it up. You can pretty much dictate 3 sentences before having to pause to check for mistakes and it will be pretty much right on."
0,"Forget the mobile app. It is useless as many accounts you can't login but with the same password and user ID you can on the desktop version. Nothing has , old problems with the mobile app in previous versions."
0,"makes shockwave crash and causes any video viewed online to be really laggy. also causes web pages to load terribly slow. i have a very good computer, i have never had these issues til about 12 hours after installing and upgrading avast on my pc.( AMD Phenom(tm)II X6 1091T processor 3.20 HZ, 16 GB DDR4 RAM, 64 Bit, Nvidia GeForce GTX 780 graphics card)"
1,I wish I could find another company who put out this type of software. Once the data file gets too big the automatic updates cease. Very frustrating. This happened with 2014 and 2015 for me.
4,"My son learned how to type using this product. He also had the Spongebob typing program, and tried a few online games, but this is the one that he kept coming back to play with. He's ten, and he now types about 20 wpm."
2,"TurboTax worked good up to a point.  Stock transactions should be included in Deluxe at no cost.  The download of financial transactions was a disaster!  I have multiple accounts and needed transactions from just one taxable account.  The download drew from multiple accounts and doubled up on some items I had already entered.  It needs to be set up to select an individual account to upload just transactions.  I had to go back and redo the return to back out the download.  4 stars for the basic package, 1 star for the download and no stars for charging for an upgrade for stock transactions."
0,"doesn't sync right also shows wrong balance. So the program made to help you keep track can actually help you have a heart attack. I am still working on getting a refund since its a download amazon wont help and quicken gives me every excuse possible of why they wont refund me. If you want budget help here is your first tip to save, &#34;DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY&#34;. Its 2014 your banks update info is more accurate then this is and good luck trying to cancel it."
2,There is so much you have to do to adjust the program to get your numbers right. Once all your numbers are right I am sure you will be pleased.
1,"I purchased this in two different languages for Mac: Arabic and Mandarin.  I installed Mandarin first.  When I opened it, it prompted me to do two levels of upgrades.  So I did those, opened it, and it will only let me add a product via a CD.  Since this is a software download, I obviously don't have one.  No way to use the program at all, can't even access most of the menu items because the &#34;add language (via CD)&#34; menu supersedes them.  I uninstalled the Mandarin and tried again with the second language (Arabic).<br /><br />I installed only the first update of the Arabic version.  The first update left with me a program called &#34;Rosetta Stone TOTALe.&#34;  The second upgrade is a program called just &#34;Rosetta Stone.&#34;  &#34;Rosetta Stone&#34; seems to only accept adding languages via your CD drive.  Rosetta Stone TotalE at least let me use the software key I got when I purchased the software.  I tried to do the second upgrade after I had loaded the language with my software key, but it once again left me with &#34;Rosetta Stone&#34; and wanted me to insert a CD.  Clearly, Rosetta Stone and/or Amazon need to really work out what they are selling us.<br /><br />Additionally, there seems to be no way for me to add my Mandarin language key into my Arabic Rosetta Stone TOTALe.  I will be contacting Amazon about a refund for at least the Mandarin.  Maybe both, since I don't know if I will be able to upgrade to new Arabic levels, etc."
1,Nice to have. Found stuff Norton missed.
1,has too may popups
0,Quickbooks has done a great disservice to its clients by putting out such an inferior product that can not even do reports were the debits and credits are correct after this many years. They should be ashamed to even be in business.
0,"I bought the H&R Block Deluxe at home software to do my taxes this year. It is a program very similar to Turbo Tax. Pretty Simple to use...BUT!!!!...H&R Block won't stand behind their product nor admit mistakes. Anyone who E-Filed their Federal Return with form 8863 (Education Credits) before FEB 22, H&R screwed it up and now our returns are delayed up to 6 more weeks beyond the 21 day window. When I asked for a refund, they said no. When I asked why not, because their website says 100% Satisfaction Guarantee, they said its an IRS problem. Well doing further research, I discovered that it is in fact H&R's problem. They failed to update their servers and software properly for this years tax season. Needless to say, RUN far away from this product. I am filing a complaint with my credit card to see if they will honor H&R's money back guarantee."
0,"This is misleading.  This product says 2014 State and Federal, and when I finished the Federal return, the software said I needed to pay another $39.99 for the state version.  The Federal version alone was $10 less than this version which is supposed to include the state return.  I could have purchased that version if I knew I was going to get ripped off like this and saved 10 bucks.  What is going on?  Also, how do I get my discount/refund that was promised for those users that purchased the Deluxe version?  That is unclear as well.  What a joke.  Intuit, a little advice... STOP the MISLEADING ADVERTISING.  SELL YOUR PRODUCT BASED ON ITS OWN MERITS.  YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF REPEAT CUSTOMERS THAT WILL NO LONGER BE REPEAT CUSTOMERS IF YOU DON'T STOP THIS NONSENSE!"
4,I recommend AVAST and have installed it on all my computers and my mothers. Its the first protection package that I actually feel does what its supposed to and doesn't bring a bunch of malware with it. I am very happy with it.
3,the purchase and download was easy. the upgrade was easy to perform. no problems with the install or issues since.
2,I downloaded it and after 30 days it said that it was an unlicensed product. I don't think I will buy that off of here again.
1,I was forced to convert from Quicken 2012 to 2015. I've used quicken for 13 years and I thought I'd be able to manually download transactions and reconcile accounts with the old software while I moved from a PC to a mac. I bank with a national bank so I didn't think the support on their end would be a problem. I tried to manually download transactions and I received an error message that the bank wasn't recognized and nothing downloaded. In order to continue to download transactions I was forced to buy this software. I downloaded it and then before I could use the software I was forced to register with intuit. I have an intuit ID but i got an error message that wouldn't let me register the software. I had to download a patch for the brand new software from Intuit's website before I could even see my quicken information that was on the computer. This was a very bad customer experience that I won't soon forget. Once I was able to open the software I was able to pick up where I left off and download transactions. The interface is different from 2012 but at least it's familiar. I'm now in the market for new financial software for the mac.
3,"What can you say, it's TurboTax.  I've been using it for over 10 years and get good results.  May do better with CPA, but CPA costs more."
0,"Your data is no longer secure. If you want to use the automated download from your bank features you now have to have an Intuit account. I don't want Intuit to have access to my data and my passwords. If they say the don't than I don't see the point of having to log in to yet another account instead of just my bank account. This is logic, not tech. This makes things harder, not easier. It is also less secure since now there's 2 points of failure.<br />Looks like Intuit is hell-bent on pissing off its customers"
3,"This latest version of Painter is phenomenal. The addition of the new perspective guide is an extremely useful tool as is the brush search. Corel has also added the ability to use a reference image...how handy is that?<br /><br />The biggest improvement as far as I'm concerned is the stability of the program. I've been using Painter since version 8, and I believe that X3 is the most stable version I've ever used. It has all the wonderful new features which were included with Painter 12, plus stability. Wonderful!<br /><br />If you are interested in learning to create digital art, I cannot recommend any program as highly as Painter X3. The ability to customize your workspace, create your own brushes, and create custom palettes containing only the materials you personally use...no other painting program has these abilities, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. Combine this with the plethora of already available brushes, paper textures, patterns and more, and there is no limit to what can be done when you use Painter X3.<br /><br />I was a Beta tester for this version and I'm so very pleased with the final product. Painter still isn't perfect, and improvements can always be made, but at this moment in time, I think this is the very best digital painting program available. It can only get better from here."
4,I needed an antivirus application and know the quality of Norton products.  This was a no brainer for me and I am glad it was so simple to get.
1,"The title of this product suggests that the e-filing charge is included in the purchase of the software. I had a surprise fee totaling $69.98 to e-file my taxes on top of the ~$70 that I paid for the software.  Come to find out, there is but one line in the product's description that tells you that this product covers your state tax preparation and printing only, with e-filing at an extra charge.  I am extremely disappointed in how deceiving this is, especially with the item title they use.<br /><br />Amazon needs to re-title this product and make it more clear that there is a specific additional charge range (ex: $20-70) for e-filing.<br /><br />Because of this deception, I will never use nor recommend this product again."
0,"You can't even trust it to copy last years information correctly. I used it last year, and got a state refund. The auto import of the state refund for last year was not equal to what it was in their own document. I put in a support request because this might be happening to others, but got no response."
1,The new version is much too complicated.  It's unnessary to make it so hard to use.  Simple was much better.  The product is not user friendly and I've used Quicken for over 20 years and have used Quickbooks for almost as long.  It's diffecult to navigate and is laid out illogically.  Go back to the drawing board!  I'm for somthing to replace  Quicken.  I will be eliminating the use of online bill pay through quicken and use my banks online bill pay as it much easier to use.
3,"What else can I say? If you want to do your taxes, this software walks you through the entire process, including extras &#34;other&#34; programs do not include."
0,"I made the manditory upgrade from 2011 to 2013 and hate it.  Been a customer since 1997.  The 2014 version is very unstable! Crashes each time I use it.  Normally, Intuit fixes the bugs after the first two  or three patches; however, not the case this time.  If at all possible, please wait before you down load this software!  We can only hope next set of patches work."
4,"I enjoy using the program and receiving the updates on a regular basis.  It is so convenient with this program.  Rarely have I had any issues and of course, it is great that the CEO and our accounting firm across town all have access to the financials at any time from any where."
1,"I have not had time to evaluate the software. Many phone calls to Adobe to get off there 30 day trial status, and that I bought the software"
3,"Adobe Lightroom (LR) continues the tradition of strong photo editing tools for Pro-Consumers like myself.  I upgraded from LR3 to LR 4 as it supports the &#34;raw&#34; camera format from the Canon 5D Mark III.  LR 3 did not recognize this camera raw file format natively and I did not wish to convert Canon Raw files to TIFF or DNG before processing in LR.<br /><br />Overall, I am impressed with the tool.  I have noticed that the digital &#34;noise&#34; (i.e. luminance as Adobe calls it) correction works beautifully.  I no longer need &#34;Noise Ninja.&#34;  The tool does a nice job with file exports and automated &#34;water marks.&#34;  I use these features a great deal.  I am still frustrated that some features - like auto file renaming on import - as it is not there on the import screen.  LR makes you rename files after you have imported them.  LR also does not let you set 'automatic' lens correction on import.  Other products do.  I shoot only Canon lens and would appreciate LR 4 applying the &#34;lens correction&#34; on import rather than on the &#34;Development&#34; tab on a file by file basis.  Presently, this is not an available 'batch' feature.<br /><br />IMHO, most consumers should look into Google's Picasa.  As a free tool, it is more intuitive than Adobe Lightroom.  There are some easier controls for amateurs and non-pros. Many times I find myself using Picasa instead of LR for quick imports and edits.<br /><br />Unless you need some native file support from newer cameras, I would recommend folks still with LR 3 as there are very few compelling features that require users to upgrade.  Only pros / pro-consumers really need the new features of LR 4.<br /><br />I know there are fans of DxO Optics Pro and Apple's Aperture.  I read reviews on these products and chose Lightroom over them as LR supports many more &#34;plug-ins&#34; and native editing on dual screens.  One of my favorite plug-ins is &#34;Portrait Professional.&#34;  It is great for quick touch ups."
4,You can get the bundle discount on digital downloads of Quicken and Turbo Tax even though the purchase of digital software does not go through the cart and are paid for one at a time.  After phoning customer support I first purchased Turbo Tax and then purchased Quicken.  At the point it asked for payment on the second product it also showed the $35 discount.  So it did actually work :-)
1,"This probably does fine for what it does, but it does not do what I needed and believed I bought from the description of the item"
1,"I am currently converting from PC to Mac and downloaded the Quickbooks for Mac.  I use Quickbooks Payroll service and discovered after the download the payroll is not intregrated and must be done online only.  The only way to put payroll information into Quickbooks is by importing. I guess I should have asked my question differently when I inquired about Quickbooks for Mac.  I asked if it handled payroll, I did not ask if it was integrated.<br /><br />Payroll is challenging enough without the possibility of errors.  The sad part in addition is that is a download, so there is no refund.<br /><br />I will not use this until the payroll is integrated into Quickbooks and not stand alone."
0,Too old fashioned cloud drive to be welcomed by the user.
3,"Found a virus which I had searched for and couldn't find.  good product, hardly noticeable slowdown. Did not realize that<br />I purchased a 30 day trial version.  I did replace it with a one year, three computer 010 version.<br />thanks Joe Dickson"
2,"I bought this product for my gifted first grader.  It's is not really challenging for her.  The graphics are kind of cute.  My daughter gets some amusement from playing this game.  It's basically a review for her.  However, if you have a child who is struggling in second grade, I think this is perfect.  It would not be aggravating for a child who is trying to get some extra practice."
0,"After I installed this SW, my PC crashed. I have to recover my system and install every SW again. I deserve a compensation on buying it."
2,"Dumbed-down re-make of the formerly wonderful Norton Internet Security.  Ugly, washed-out looking, confusing interface, lousy settings presentation. That's Norton progress....Take a great product, screw it up and re-introduce it at a higher price.  America!  What a great country!"
3,"I have been tracking 100 plus accounts for years with Quicken for Windows. I wanted to switch to Mac but was afraid to try this program. All old transactions imported flawlessly. All itemized categories as well. Uploading is now easier. I understand the anger at the loss of features but for what I need, it is an improvement and I no longer have to deal with Windows."
3,"I am from a small rural area, we do not have much tax support.  In my opinion, the people who do taxes in my area are lazy and will not find you the best refunds that you can possibly get.  I got tired of not getting my maximum refund, so I turned to Turbotax.  Turbotax found me my best possible refund.  I am a college student, and pay a lot for my school and supplies.  They were able to find me $1,300 just for being a student.  What college student doesn't love free money??  I know I was happy when I saw that amount!  I felt very secure using Turbotax, I know this is a review for software, but I just used the internet [...].  It was fast and easy.  They always had help very close by.  If I did not understand something, they also had an explanation on the side telling me what the specific box was for.  One thing that is very important is how fast you are able to get your refund back.  I got my state return back within a week.  I got my federal return back within two weeks.  The turnaround was so fast and it is very helpful for people who are waiting for that tax money.  I did have to pay extra for my state return, but that did not bother me.  Turbotax is fast and it finds you ways to get more money."
3,"Good but I am having some problems reconciling accounts. It is a surprise. I was doing this well in previous version, but now I cannot. It is specific to a few accounts."
3,I've been using AVAST! free version for 15+ years and have never had any problems with it. I've never had anything bad get through it either. I would reccommend it ( and have ) to anyone for home use. It's a good all-around anti-virus program. They always keep you up-to-date with any threats that come along. AVAST ! also plays well with other programs.
1,I was required to do an upgrade which I did not need to continue filing my taxes. I knew it was unnecessary in my case but turbo need more money so they got it. The required upgrade did not put a dime in my pockets but did in turbo's pocket. Good for turbo. I was in no way compensated for the previous remarks.
3,"I use Photoshop mostly to process digital camera pictures (JPEG), to prepare images to use in PowerPoint for lectures, and occasionally to process microscope images and to prepare labeled figures in TIFF format for scientific publications/grant proposals. I've been using Photoshop 7.0 for many years and finally decided it was time to put it to rest and upgrade to something more appropriate for my new Windows 7 computer. Now that I have CS6 working fine on the computer, I am really enjoying it and still discovering new features nearly every day. But it was a rather complicated procedure to get there. So overall, I would give it five stars for features and performance but only two to three stars for ease of installation due to the problems I ran into.<br /><br />Part 1 - Getting it to work:<br /><br />I have to admit that I made it somewhat more complicated by purchasing CS5 the first week of May and requesting the free complimentary CS6 upgrade download when it came out. To get CS6 to properly run on my computer, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling twice (seems to be the standard help suggestion, but didn't do anything to fix my issues) and got exasperated enough to do a system restore at one point and start over.<br /><br />I ran into two main issues:<br /><br />1) I could not get files to open with Photoshop by right-clicking on them as I had been able to with PS7. I was able to open files from within Photoshop, but neither CS5 nor CS6 showed up as selectable options in the list of programs to open files with on right-click. My usual workflow when processing pictures downloaded from my camera is to sort through them with Windows Live Photo Gallery and then right-click and open the ones I select to edit. So this was a significant complication as I now had to browse to and open the file from within Photoshop to be able to edit pictures. Looking for solutions online, this seemed to be a fairly common problem with CS5/CS6 installations on computers previously runningPS7. It took me quite a while though to find a fix that worked (most \\""solutions\\"" posted were unhelpful) and ultimately I had to manually change a registry key that was still pointing to my old PS7 program. Once I had pointed that key to the new program, I was then able to right-click and open files in CS6. I would hope for any new program installation that it should not require manually messing with the registry on the computer to make it work properly.<br /><br />2) I also had weird display issues with \\""transparent\\"" type checkerboard fill patterns and thumbnails overlaying part of my images in CS6. This only occurred after I upgraded from the CS5 to the CS6 version, I did not see it when testing CS5. Again, searching online it seemed not uncommon to run into this problem with CS6. The fix was to download and install an updated driver for my video card. My computer isn't that old yet, so I was surprised to find that CS6 would not work properly without updating the video card driver. It seems this program requires the very latest drivers or it won't display properly.<br /><br />So I would rate my installation experience maybe two to three stars at best due to these issues. It took me a significant amount of time troubleshooting to get the program working. These issues may not occur with a brand-new and \\""clean\\"" computer that has never had any previous Photoshop version installed, but I doubt this would be the case for most people buying Photoshop CS6.<br /><br />Part 2 - Now that it works:<br /><br />CS6 seems to open and run faster than CS5, which by comparison acted rather sluggish before the upgrade. So performance seems to have improved. My first impression when opening the program was that CS6 looks too dark and my first instinct was to change the background back to the lighter gray I was used to with the older Photoshop version. The darker look is growing on me though and overall the interface looks much sleeker and does a nice job of presenting the pictures.<br /><br />So far I'm really enjoying exploring all the features in CS6. Jumping to CS6 from PS7 comes with a steep learning curve, but I was expecting that. I still find myself searching for certain functions that I used in the old program that have been moved around, but mostly I'm able to eventually find them or figure out alternative features that do a much better job. I'm missing a good manual for the program, so I'm sure there are many features that I'm still overlooking right now. It does everything I need it to do though, including working well with my ancient HP flatbed scanner once I figured out how to connect to it (File - Import - WIA Support).<br /><br />I love the new crop tool and the overlays it provides as compositional aids (rule-of-thirds, triangle, golden spiral etc). The content-aware functions are fun to play with and generally give very good results. I also love the ability to merge and stack images in Photoshop now. I have in the past used free software such as CombineZM for focus stacks or Microsoft ICE for panoramics. Now I can do all that in Photoshop and the results look very pleasing. I would not have figured out how to do the focus stacking though without finding an online tutorial for it. I'm also enjoying playing with the HDR function on occasion, but this is totally new to me since I have not used any other HDR program before (my camera does not provide RAW files).<br /><br />Overall, the program is feature-rich and performing reliably now after ironing out the issues mentioned above. So I would give it five stars for performance and features. It does have a steep learning curve, but is intuitive enough that I can do most of what I want with it without having detailed instructions (some experience with older Photoshop versions will help). I'm looking forward to learning more about how to use it to its full potential."
2,"As a long time devotee of Quicken products, I have come to rely on them enthusiastically for my accounting and investment tracking needs.  When Quicken 2014 appeared, I immediately upgraded from 2013 to the new version.  Two problems were immediately apparent -- 1) 2014 takes significantly longer to execute on my machine (a 64-bit PC running Windows 7.  As I go from account to account or operation to operation, it seems Quicken 2014 has to stop and \\""think about it\\"" before moving on.  2) as one whose eyesight is failing, I can only read the fonts for the account list, home page and and one step upgrade summaries with great difficulty.  I have easily adjusted the register fonts, but not those of the rest of the display.  The \\""large fonts\\"" option under \\""preferences\\"" does not change non-register fonts.<br /><br />Quicken as a financial tool is perfect for my purposes, however, if the difficulties of using it worsen (e.g., especially the GUI), I will have to look for another solution to my accounting needs."
1,"I have down loaded this TWICE hoping to fix the problems, and it still has not. This is very hard to use, You have folders upon folders, no main link, or shortcut on the desktop. If you want 3rd grade, you have to FIND 3rd grade in ALL the folders that was downloaded, then you have several folders to chose from, it's hit and miss. I was vary dissapointed in how this downloaded. But My child does like it once I finally get her started on something, but then she really gets into it and I have to go navigate again to move her to the next &#34;level&#34; Wish there was a fix!"

0,"Like so many others, I purchased PS Pro 3.5 because my previous version of Print Shop would not run on Windows 8.1. I understand some of the initial bugs were solved with a later update, and that's good to know. There is one real problem. Some of the basic features that I relied on for nearly every project are not available on this version. Today I am frustrated to learn that the only line spacing available is 1, 1.5 and 2.0. Also, text stretch is gone (at least I can't find it and a search on the ridiculous help site yields &#34;no related subject&#34;.) Why in the world would you release an &#34;upgrade&#34; that omits such elementary capabilities?<br />There may be some great new features here, but honestly, it's like buying a fancy new car that doesn't have reverse, flashy to look at, but useless.<br />So I am in search of different software. I have used Print Shop in various incarnations for at least 15 years, but these small oversights have rendered the software useless to me."
3,"I purchased the Garmin map upgrade, rather than spend twice as much for a new Garmin. The new maps have some roads that were missing around me in the old Garmin. It works just fine, only it seems to take longer for the maps to load now then it did before, perhaps as much as a minute before the system is ready for me to enter destination information. I have learned to put a picture on the opening screen, and I know I am still not taking advantage of what can be done when the unit is connected via USB port to my computer. In total, I would say it is well worth the price. I particularly like setting the voice to either different accents, or different languages. It is also fun to take some different routes as suggested by the Garmin on some familiar trips."
3,"I had trouble with the initial process.....once payment was sent the user interface to prove my daughter was a college student was a pain.....after a full day of calling microsoft (not much help) & Amazon (not much help either) I figured it out on my own..........the product works great though and my daughter is happy so that's all that counts, right? :D"
2,Maybe I was oversold. Many people comment on Quicken and I see about half and half good and not so good comments. My salesperson was very high on Quicken which is just fine. I enjoy being able to have all finances in one spot. My biggest complaints are with the transferring from banks and other institutions. For some reason it will transfer transactions over twice. Not all if them but a good amount is transferred twice. It took a little bit to figure this out. Why aren't my balances equal and I know I didn't eat out or buy that stock more than once. I called the help desk about it and they said it was my institutions. I could buy that if it was just one. It was four. I asked for new software( maybe defective) I was told no. I thought there was a money back satisfaction thing or something. I was wrong. As of right now I'm not using it just going from website to website getting my info. Maybe someday!!!!
2,I purchased this before my trip to Hawaii last summer but i don't think it was as updated as i thought it would be. Not sure it fully updated???
3,I liked the website better. This was cheaper and similar however the last minute surprise was that I had to pay extra to efile my state taxes
2,"If you don't have a clue about corporate taxes and accounting terms you will have a hard time doing your own taxes even with TurboTax. I used TurboTax to do my husband's corporation's taxes, but to be honest, I am shivering at the thought of being audited. If you can afford it, hire a CPA."
1,New turbo tax made me nervous as it did not cover what deluxe covered and I had to pay fee to file state tax. It took over 30 minutes to get help. Also it did not have audit risk profile.
3,Easy to use and it covered all my needs. Was great at bringing up my information from last year.
3,"Did everything I needed it to do - and I used the free trial period to teach myself the program.  It's stable, it runs well.  Only beef is that it doesn't import .AVI files, so I have to to convert those to MP4s to import then."
2,"I have used Quicken for years and have no intention to change -- it's that good!  However, I've been having problems with the program crashing when I try to backup -- roughly, one-out-of-four times."
1,"It does what it is supposed to do, but my complaint is that it couldn't import the previous year's return... Really?"
3,"Love it, wish I had been able to get it initially. Did not know the forms I need had been removed from the Deluxe edition."
4,Always a great purchase
0,"Shortly after I loaded Norton 360, my computer got infected.  Spent a lot of time figuring out.  I had good experience with Norton Internet security (not Norton 360) before; this was total disappointment.  Worse, I cannot get refund. I do not recommend this product."
4,"The process of getting the software as a download worked well. An easy step-by-step coaching process, the download and execution easy."
1,"I do like the fact that Sony makes a trial version available.  That is great and I had not problem with the installation. The reason I was looking at this product is that I wanted to be able to take GoPro HD  video and burn it to an AVCHD DVD.  This capability lets you play the DVD in a Blue Ray player at full HD resolution. Apparently this capability was there in the older versions of this Sony product, but Sony decided to remove it. (you can only guess what there reasons were) If they added this capability back into the product, I would change my review rating."
0,"If you're going to buy this, be aware that you will receive no useful support if you have a problem.  I set the software to back up every week online, but nothing happened.  What's more, it would not even allow me to back up manually. After waiting for 30 minutes to reach chat support, the tech wanted to remotely access my computer.  (As someone who's designed software, I can assure you this is something you never want to do.  These minimally-trained techs can trash your operating system in a few seconds.)  After about 20 minutes of unsuccessful chat troubleshooting, the tech sent me a link with written instructions, which did not help.  Eventually, I located a support phone number (800-695-0678), but after an hour on hold, I gave up.  I even tried to design a workaround to trick the software into backing up, but after a few minutes it timed out.  Currently reviewing other security software, and by the end of the day I will have uninstalled Norton and moved on."
1,It notably slowed down my computer.
2,I expected less bells and whistles - it takes too long to load and carry out any command
1,"I thought $40 was too much to renew my subscription to the security software that came with my computer, so I bought this thinking I was getting a much better deal. Wrong. I should've known better. Nothing but trouble since installing (Windows 8). One example,  every time the program updates itself, my internet hangs up and I have to reboot. I had to reboot to post this review."
4,Liked the features for the price i bought it for!! Not for advanced usage. Very simple to use so any user can use it to be creative!!
2,"I used the CD version of this last year for my taxes with good results. My taxes were accurate this year, but it is a little weird. I had to manipulate it so that we could apply two different education credits. It also kept asking for me to pay for the California State form, which was included with this package. I just printed it out and sent it in, with no issues. It took a little bit to download, and we have a new processor, and upgraded memory, so I could only imagine how long it would have taken on my other computer. It seemed to have a slight issue connecting with last years information from H&R Block CD, but nothing major. I think I will still stick to the CD next year. I am happy it got my taxes correct, that's what really matters."
3,"Turbo Tax is the software I use because having started off using it in the beginning I can now easily import details from a previous tax year to the current one rather than having to type in all of that all over again.  For this reason any incentive to try out a different tax software has, unfortunately, become minimal. The dread of typing in all kinds of details that are importable in Turbo Tax is what's keeping me stuck with the Turbo. The Deluxe version is more appropriate to me than either the Basic or the Premier. To determine which version to select for one's particular needs visit the Turbo Tax home page at [...]"
2,"A few parts were confusing, but I finished the taxes with just a few hours of work. It's good for those who don't have too many investments or intricate business dealings to do it alone."
3,"I am and have been running Avast on our laptops, desktop, and even on my android based cell phone. I replaced my other programs like MSE because Avast was just doing a better job of keeping the junk out. I am still using the free download but am seriously considering purchasing the premium version as I expect to be keep using this program for the foreseeable future."
4,"I'm new to architectural software. I was looking for something to visaulize a remodel of a house we're about to buy, to see how our furniture would fit, and to viualize artwork on the walls. The house I modeled is a square-ish structure with a daylight basement, dorma, two slab-based additions (screened-in porch and sun room), and a detached garage.    I initially tried [...] and paid them $75 to build the basic floorplan for me; however, once I tried to use it, it was a disater. I couldn't even figure out how to move from floor to floor in blueprint mode and the online help wasn't very good. Moreover the plans they supplied were wrong: they showed french doors instead of regular windows in the sun room. I e-mailed them about this and got no reply. ($100 wasted)    I then did some more research and downloaded a trial of Home Design Suite 9.0. I very quickly had my floorplan laid out and by the end of the day had most of our furniture installed, artwork containing my photography on the walls, and movies on the plasma tv's with scenes from my favorite movies.     The only negative thing is that I spent a couple of hours on the trial and got a lot of the floorplan completed, but couldn't enter the key I'd just purchased and save my work (the trial version cannot save, print, import, export, etc.). So I basically had to do it all over again.    The online help is great and there are a ton of online tutorial videos. I found answers to all my questions except 1 (adding driveways, sidewalks and roads) using the available online resources.    I plan to use it to remodel the kitchen, plan furniture layouts and to draw electrical plans for permits when we finally move.    There is a large tree in the yard of the house we are buying and I tried to find it in the plant library, but none of the trees in there were anything like it. Unfortunately, I know little about trees so I've no idea what species it is, but none of the pictures were anything close.    I highly recommend it.For under $100, it's a great deal.    Mark"
3,"If you have more than the simple tax return to do. This will be basically like going to the H&R Block office to get your taxes done. It has a series of questions that guide you through the process. Plus if you use it year to year, it will import most of your information from the previous year.<br /><br />The business part of the program could use work as it is slightly glitchy."
2,"I came back to H&R Block, after a few years with Turbo. Tax.  In fairness, they've both been able to get the job done for me in the past.  They are both lacking in planning for the next year tax, such as making sure that you aren't over/under paying estimated taxes, when investment income is changing or you get lump sums.    The main reason I went with Block this year is the outrageous money grab on the part of TT.  Removing a capability that was in previous year versions is just another way of raising the price. It's a sneaky way too, since people who have used it before don't typically read the reviews again. When they get the product installed, many will not want to go through the hassle of getting and installing the new software, and returning the TT - time IS money!    Turbo Tax is DEAD TO ME for what they have done!  I know that they are trying to smooth things over, but my answer is: too little and too late.  Also, weren't they the ones who got bad press a few years ago for some intrusive copy protection scheme?    Also, both companies make you play the game of shopping around and waiting for when the price will drop. How about something simple like provide the guaranteed lowest price to people who sign up in advance for next year version?  I've seen where some will do all that, BUT offer it to you at full retail price - wrong answer."
1,"I have been using Turbo Tax for years, but was not happy with this years version at all. I bought this version and did not realize that it did not include the State forms, so had to pay another 39.99 to download my state forms. Next time I'll look more closely at the product and not just go for the Deluxe version. Then come to find out after waiting over a month for my State of Maine return that the 1040ME forms were incorrect so the information was held until they could check the numbers. I will finally be getting my refund after calling the State, but not sure I will go this route next year."
4,It has worked so well so far. I am grateful for this program keeping my computer clean. It is smooth and easy to use.
0,"My husband is a partner in a small S-corp so we get a K-1 each year.  For 10 years now we've used TT Deluxe to file taxes. We bought the 2014 version back in January and finished all our personal data entry in April, but then had to wait until end of May to get the K-1 from the company accountant.  When I went to enter it tonight, I discovered that I was unable to continue without forking over $30 to upgrade to Premier!  Having already purchased the wrong version and invested so much time with it, it was too late to even consider other options.  It seems that I even missed out on the rebate Intuit offered to its rightfully outraged client base.  If I'd know up front I would have complained but probably gone ahead with the purchase, but the way this played out I feel like I've just been shaken down by the mob."
0,"Seems fine on my newer systems, EXCEPT:<br /><br />After installing the first 1 User / 3 PC subscription for my computers, bought another 1U/3PC for my wife's computers.  On her laptop it never successfully ran a scan, had to reinstall.  During this, logged into my Norton Account which only shows a single 1U/3PC subscription, all of which are used up.  What happened to my second purchase?<br /><br />When I put this on a Dell GX620 (2.80GHz Pentium D, 2GB RAM, Windows XP) the system made it horribly slow (20 seconds! to switch apps or respond to the Start button).  For that computer I am going back to the previous version of Norton 360 which worked fine on this system."
0,Norton used to have a good reputation found out malware and  Trojans have been getting right by the Norton software would not recommend to anybody.<br />Got a hold of customer support and they wanted to charge me an additional $99 no thanks and to make matters worse all of their customer support has been outsourced to India.<br />Go Get the Free Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool<br />and you will see for yourself that norton is a poor product.<br />good luck if you bought this product.
3,The quicken is great for keeping track of all expenditures. I use it for mostly balancing my bank and visa accounts (to  see if any weird charges show up) and to keep a monthly report of where I spend my money. Great if you have to budget each month and try to maintain a goal.
2,"I would rate the product as OK, I have used TurboTax for several years w/o any complaints. I would like to see them add State filing w/o having to pay extra."
0,"Really messed up my computer. Erased all of my Chrome bookmarks, would not allow the computer to shut down. Apparently there was something running in the background that I could not find. Tried going to the Restore Point just prior to installation. Failed. Finally booted up in Safe Mode and went to a Restore Point a week back. Found existing Norton Antivius was disabled, in fact, could no longer be detected on my computer. Ran Malwarebytes and Adwcleaner and found a way to reinstall Norton. Went ahead and re-upped Norton for another year. Should have done that in the first place. btw, running Win7 64bit if that makes any diference."
4,A good buy on the lifetime map option. Real easy download process. Amazon's setup is a piece of cake. I had to be patient while downloading the update to the GPS as it takes a long time.
4,"husband has yet to tell me how he likes it, sorry. but I used it and it seems pretty cool and easy to use."
2,"Seemed to do an excilent job.  For a free antivirus well worth downloading, hopefully I can keep it on my computer"
2,I hate tax season. Most of these tax software companies are the same. Doesn'y matter which you buy.
3,"Quicken is still the best desktop app for managing personal finances in one place. While 2014 didn't add any significant changes, the sync to mobile app is much faster than it was for 2013 (especially if you start a new file, as I did at the beginning of 2014.)<br />I gave this program 4 stars, because there are some lingering issues from 2013, the most glaring is that the software engineers think we users are too stupid to choose our own category for mortgage interest.  If you edit this category it breaks the mortgage payment process and you will have to edit payments after entering them. Also, because I track all of my accounts online I am faced with the choice of upgrading or manually entering transactions or reconciling the accounts. (Intuit supports the current version and two prior versions for online banking and I don't have a problem with that.)"
0,"We have been used Quickbooks since the Pro version came out a long time ago. We were satisfied with the product up through the 2011 version. We were forced to upgrade to the 2014 version because of our use of assisted payroll. We have found QB 2014 to be the buggiest version yet to be released by intuit, particularly multiuser with Windows 8. We have lost countless hours with tech support along with approximately 40 hours of accounting work because of a glitch in the payroll module. Last weeks update to R5 is now preventing my computer from opening any of our QB files and it is back to tech support once again.and prompting me to my first ever product review. I understand that QB has a 90 % market share but I need a product that does not require so much tech support to keep it working."
0,"I bought and up charged thinking that I would get a better version than their lower cost software.  It is absolutely useless.<br /><br />As Pt Barnum said &#34;there is a sucker born every day&#34;.  You can easily find their calculators on the internet for free.  You can not store your results or print them out so other than just a calculator it has not use.  I wanted to track my mortgage payments and all you can do is to reenter your info each month because it will not save a file or print out the results.  That means if you make more than your scheduled payment there is no way to see what it does to your balance.  It is very elementary, and even the help file is six lines long from start to finish."
3,"Does what i you expect. No big improvement over last upgrade. They make you buy new version, even if old version does everything you needed"
0,"Unlike the desktop version, the online version only allows for one company file to be completed.  Additional fees apply for every additional company file that needs to be created.  If you run or operate multiple companies, the desktop version is the only way to go."
3,This software does what I want it to do but it is still more expensive than it should be.  buy it if you need it.
2,"I use the Editor that guides you as the full editor is very confusing to me.  Good piece of software, but hard to use."
3,"I have been using Turbotax since the mid-nineties.Very easy to file an amended return, great program! I hate doing taxes almost as much as paying someone to do them for me."
4,It was so easy. I know there was a problem with the state filing but it didn't effect me.
2,"I have used TurboTax in the past, which is why I tried it this year.  I had the information needed and input all; everything was as expected. But I was pretty appalled at the obvious DECEITFUL approach to  efiling the state tax; thereby increasing the cost of the Software by 50%!!!!  The tactic closely equalled that used by Columbia records years ago:  &#34;You can buy a fabulous _____(fill in) for only $15.00!!&#34;  and if you don't respond they send it AND Bill you anyway--because you did not tell them explicitly that you were NOT interested.<br />In Turbo Tax' strategy, you have everything you need to efile the Fed and state tax.  The Fed tax can be easily submitted....but wait, in order to efile the state tax, you have to pay them an additional $25.  AND your state tax is in efile format; AND you do NOT have the information as to how to send it via snail mail,  FOUL!"
4,"I've been computing since DOS, and have burned through an awful lot of software in that time, including utilities like anti-virus.  I've used all the big ones and some lesser ones, too.  Webroot Antivirus has to rank as THE BEST.  Start with ease of installation.  Then, when running, I quickly noted its simplicity of interface, smoothness of operation running in background, the quickness and almost perfect transparency of its scans, and its fully intelligible reports.  Most of all, however, were the smack-on results it gave me.  Which requires me to relate an abbreviated story: For over a year my home PC, running Vista, had been subject to irregular, and annoyingly frequent freezing of the screen and all input devices, sometimes once a week, more often three or four times per day.  Over many months, I painstakingly researched the possible causes, and one by one eliminated them, with no success. I was all ready to strip out Vista and migrate to 7, when my former top-rated anti-virus subscription ran out. I decided to try Webroot, because it was less expensive, and well recommended.  Immediately on installing Webroot and performing the first scan, it detected hundreds of malware, spyware, etc. that my big name-brand anti-virus hadn't.  Best of all, the freeze-ups vanished, and NEVER returned. It's been several months, and not only is my PC free of freeze-ups, my wife swears it does everything faster that when it was new.  Webroot, we're fans.  Keep up the good work.<br /><br />2013 UPDATE:  I originally bought Webroot in 2011, and wrote the preceding review on the Amazon page for that version of the product.  Having now used Webroot for over two years, renewing my subscription, I remain as steadfastly dedicated to it as I was back when..."
1,It's built generally with a sales like business in mind.  They should explore more examples in their tutorial text to help folks along or allow people to select an industry that then matches the example text to your business concept.
4,I have used Avast free Antivirus for more than 3 years on 3 different computers and really like the way it works and protects.
2,"Payee names change when transactions are downloaded, to names that are totally incorrect and inappropriate. When items are cleared, they must be reconciled individually rather than automatically reconciled when the program is closed, as was the case in previous editions."
3,"Been using the program for several years.  It's gotten better and better.  I've had problems with capital gains/losses many years ago, but they fixed their problems."
0,"This year it suks big time. Could not print my state returns so I had to E file, which cost an additional $20.00.<br />No customer support unless you want to stay on hold for hours. after 1 hour on hold I gave up. Will not use this again"
3,"I like it a great deal, but there are sometimes problems when I down load credit card accounts.  Also it seems to take longer to process when I reconcile accounts.  Sluggish sometimes.<br /><br />I use it every day to keep my accounts up to date.  I definately rely upon it, and trust it.  I particularly like the mobile aps."
1,"Problem from installation. 5 times was implied I needed to download again. got notice &#34;malware&#34;may have been &#34;added on&#34; The one time seemed to work-stopped working and couldn't recapture data Too much trouble and red flags for this software. Got numerous messages after I responded to an &#34;error message&#34; on how to &#34;fix&#34;. Was so complex for an average consumer and all the previous trouble, I decided to cut my losses and time."
4,When Charter offered subscribers a free security system I took them up on the offer and did not renew my Norton product. Boy was I sorry! I got hacked into twice in just a few months. All of my friends were receiving crazy messages claiming to be from me but I never sent those messages. When I bought the Norton the problem went away and hasn't returned.
0,"I've used turbotax for over a decade. With the price increase and being a resident of Minnesota, it's at least made the decision of hiring a CPA next year a no-brainer. The most frustrating aspect of all of this is a TOTAL lack of communication from the company regarding my state not accepting these returns. There is nothing at all on the website regarding refunds or if/when we can expect the state to accept our returns. The local paper ran a story about 90+ minute wait times on the phone line to attempt to get an answer. Even though it wasn't the cheapest, I've always used this software because it was reliable and easy to use. This year it is neither, and I will never purchase an Intuit product again. I realize that problems occur, but the company has been utterly reprehensible in its response."
4,"I am very happy with Lightroom. Altough i am an amature photographer, it helps me to stay organised and get more out of my photo's then ever before."
2,The program is good.  My biggest issue is you can't use the same data file for both Windows and Mac and can't use on a shared or network drive.
0,"Very disappointed that we were forced to buy Premier versus the usual Deluxe to handle some very basic tax situations, like K-1.<br />Many of the display pages overflow a standard laptop screen so you must scroll down even when it is just one or two questions, waste of effort.<br />Explanations are not as clear as in other years. Won't buy again."
0,I was sold this item without enough notice that I was not qualified to use it.
2,"I upgraded from Quicken Premier 2011 to Quicken Home and Business 2014 (only because the quicken \\""forced obsolescence\\"" policy forced me to, or I would lose my online services).<br /><br />Upon opening Quicken 2014, I entered my data file password and received the message \\""The password you entered does not match the stored password\\"".  After restoring several backups and trying other fixes, I used online chat help and received the following solution, which worked successfully:  you must use the Quicken Password Removal Tool, which will upload your data file to quicken where the password will be removed, and then will download the file back to your computer.  As I said, this worked correctly, and I am now working with Q 2014.  It took me about 30 minutes to reach a chat representative, and 30 minutes for the Password Removal Tool to do its job.<br /><br />The password removal tool can be found here: [...]<br /><br />You will need to know the most recent balance (according to your quicken data file) of one of your accounts; the tool asks you for a balance to verify that you are the owner of the file.<br /><br />I'm pretty disappointed that I am FORCED to upgrade, and that this upgrade and bug wasted several hours of my day.  However, I've been using Quicken for many many years, and I believe that it's the best option out there."
3,"I was looking for a simple video media program for my Dell Inspirion 531 desktop that I upgraded from Windows Vista to Windows 8. It is a good program for the money. I considered the latest Corel PowerDVD, but it didn't offer more features that I wanted, so it wasn't worth the additional money in my circumstances."
2,"a must have to transfer email .pst files when changing computers or operating systems.  Otherwise, Microsoft makes sure you suffer greatly."
0,"I don't dislike this software as much as I dislike Corel's support for it. I decided to purchase Corel Office initially because it was MS Office compatible and light on hardware resources. I purchased the retail box that contained the program on a USB drive. Unfortunately, none of my computers would recognize the USB drive, so the program couldn't be installed. I then downloaded the product from Corel's website as a trial version. When Corel's download finished installing, it asked me for a serial number to activate the full product. I entered the serial number from the USB version I purchased and was informed that the serial number was invalid. I emailed Corel support and after several days I finally got a response. After furnishing proof of purchase for the USB version, I was given a replacement serial number. The program worked fine, given its limitations. Then, after having to reinstall the program twice, because of a Windows upgrade and a computer operating system crash, I ran out of installs for the program. Corel will not authorize additional installs without purchasing extended support, which has to be purchased online and without benefit of a &#34;human&#34; representative, and there is no support number you can call to ask for a &#34;favor&#34; just so you can use the program you purchased. You get three installs and you're out of luck if you need more. So, I have a perfectly useless program. If you decide to buy Corel Office, just be aware of the three installs rule. Extended support will cost you more than program. Good luck."
3,so far so good :)
2,"Have been using Norton ever since their birthday. Until this version, all was well. THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE - A CONSTANT UPDATE. DUE TO WHICH THERE ARE CONSTANT INTERRUPTIONS. IMPOSSIBLE TO RECEIVE ANY CS, HAVE TRIED 3 TIMES. IMPOSSIBLE TO SCHEDULE UPDATES FOR MY CONVENIENCE - NORTON CHANGES MY SCHEDULE FOR THEIR OWN"
3,"A lot better than their online version but a real problem converting back from online to desktop. It made the sales tax on all sales a line item in the invoices, including them add income for income tax purposes. It means I now have to manually remove these from the invoices and assign the sales tax afor bout 9 months worth of invoices. I'm not looking forward to that!"
2,Do not like the new Quicken Essentials. The old version of Quicken was a much more user friendly software. Sorry they thought that something that worked so well needed a complete changeover.
1,Couldn't tell if it was working.
3,"Thought the $23 download sounded like a good idea.  Wrong!  Can't download.      Update!!! called customer service, got through and talked with a knowledgable tech guy.  After disabling my firewall, it downloaded smoothly.    Thanks!"
4,vhyjm
3,"I Love AVAST it has saved my bacon more times than I can count. The only thing I don't like about Avast is that it updates it's self very frequently, like 12 times a day, and when it is updating, it tends to cause Adobe Crash -er- I mean Adobe Flash, and Adobe Shock Wave, and the Zynga games that depend on Adobe Crash and Shock Wave to crash, and that gets annoying, but on the other hand I believe Adobe has saved my hard drive  at least a thousand times."
0,"Software does the job, but the GUI is very clunky. Support is the worth. They told me I can get refund, since they released 2014 a week later, but I have not heard from them for more then two weeks. There is no phone number to call."
0,Had problem getting product downloaded and then installing.  It never installed.  Would like to get a refund. Thank you! Carrie
1,"I don't like the fact that they have dropped tax forms from their product. Just raise the price and get it over with. I use those forms for partnerships, etc.... I will try HR Block and will compare the two and am currently on the fence about switching. Have been a long time customer of TurboTax."
4,"I finished my 2013 taxes last month, and noted that it was tenth year in a row I had used TurboTax. I have a variety of investments, including two rental properties, a side business, and one of those W-2 job thingies that involves a lot of travel, multiple states, and accompanying complexity. Turbo Tax seems to handle it all with aplomb. Nice work, guys!"
0,"not working,you will return my money please."
3,Allowed me to convert from my PC to MAC very easily<br />and works well<br />almost all features are preserved and program is easy to use
2,"Norton is good, there customer service was amazing but because I purchased a download from Amazon they have no record of the purchase and upon contacting Amazon they said once you hit the download button it is considered a used product and they do not do returns or refunds so Norton's 30 day money back guarantee means nothing..so please do not purchase the download version through Amazon..I have never had any other issues at Amazon and will still recommend them continue to shop from them,but no more downloads"
3,"Although I made the mistake of downloading this format on my Mac, I use it on my PC at work. A great note-taking tool and way to keep information organized. I recommend this for people who like to organize their notes."
4,"Works great. As a grad student, I need this so I can easily write papers and share them with collaborators in the appropriate APA formatting. Since I couldn't find a tutorial on setting up APA formatting for the Pages software Apple puts out.<br /><br />This has worked just I expected. I've written a bunch of papers with it, a few PowerPoint presentations, and used the Excel software too. This was the lowest price I could find, which hurts when trying to be frugal, but it's worth it if you're needing to use MS Office on a Mac."
0,"Terrible installation (or &#34;non-installation&#34;) process--order won't complete because it won't install. All system parameters far exceed requirements, normal home installation, business-class broadband. Non-refundable so Amazon won't touch it; Roxio is non-existent with customer service. Thanks, Amazon--totally worthless purchase!"
3,"I like TurboTax Deluxe very much, makes filing federal and state easy, Asks all the right questions and keeps me up to date on the latest laws. The only issue I have is that after I am done and ready to file , I get charged again for filing state income tax, I have been rebated in the past and am waiting for the rebate for this year."
2,"I am not very thrilled with Corel AfterShot Pro.  It is very complicated and I could never get it to save pictures in a different folder properly.  I'm not a geek, but I do know my way around a computer.  I don't recommend it for the average photographer."
0,It just sucked! Hated the app!
4,"Avast has saved my computer several times.  I have been very pleased with the warning system and every time I run a check, it comes out fine."
0,"This product cannot be used without significant assistance.  The terminology within the menus is inadequate at best, at times misleading.  And the help section repeats the same mistakes of logic.  If one calls Customer Service, one finds a phone bank of unknowledgeable people. I'm within moments of deleting this from my computer, with no confidence that the 90-day guaranty will prove any more satisfactory than my other contacts with the company.  The only metric this product will quicken is your blood pressure."
2,"Well, to say I was disappointed with the 2013 Quicken would be an understatement. Banks, billing, other sites - why do they feel the need to alter what is already a very good and workable product? Anyhow, I had some problems downloading from the banks with this new Quicken, which is why I HAD (yes, HAD) to buy the 2013 Quicken. That I felt was not fair anyway, to take away our downloading benefits from the older Quickens. All that aside, I am using it and I suppose I am getting more used to it as time goes by. I am really glad I didn't pay through the nose for it, as it definitely would not have been worth it and I would probably have returned it by now and started a new system. I don't usually complain about things, but this was not a good \\""upgrade\\"" as they call it, and although I am getting used to it, it has been a long and labourious trek, and I am still having to make new categories, since my old ones don't seem to work any more. We'll get there in the end, but please don't upgrade again. If anything, downgrade to what was very workable! Wish I could have said something more positive, but there you have it."
1,Over all I guess it's ok. But I want a map program that has more detail when I zoom out. As I zoom out it removes roads so it is more readable but sometimes I want that detail. MST should have a detail slider to add more or less of that detail.
3,"If you like all your financial tools in one place: financial accounts, budgets, bills, etc. then Quicken is for you. The only complaint I have is the price. For users like me who use other Intuit products every<br />year, they should reward loyal customers a discount."
0,I also have been a turbotax user for decades and this is the absolute worst. It has a known install error at 24% that stops the install with code 65535. A registry fix did NOT work on my desktop PC but did on my laptop. Now I need to do taxes on my laptop. It's also disingenuous to assert as they do that this version is better than previous 'deluxe' versions. It is not. H&R Block here I come.
1,"Ok. I bought the TurboTax package like I always do, except it was a download from the Amazon website. No problem....UNTIL I finished my Federal taxes and NOW find out that I will have to purchase a STATE version for 39.99 to complete my state taxes. I could have gotten the WHOLE PACKAGE....federal AND state for 39.00 in the first place. BOOOOOO. Why is Turbo Tax and/or Amazon trying to reinvent the wheel here??? I have used TurboTax for years and have never had a problem before now. To make matters worse, the 39.99 cost of the upgrade does not tell me up front if the new purchase includes free e-filing for the state version. BooooHISSSSS!"
0,Have been using turbo tax for about ten years. Next year I am going to try a different brand. I had to search out side of T T for answers to some of the questions I had this year and doesn't support MT state return.
2,"This product does not come auto-bundled with Microsoft office anymore. I was expected to purchase it separately. Well actually, if I wanted access to my documents I had painstakingly worked on ever again, I did not have choice. I had to shell out extra bucks for this ontop of the new computer. All of that aside, the setup process was fairly easy---because I was left to do this completely on my own too  Print preview and zoom (for some reason) are now difficult to find??"
1,This program was difficult for me to use. The directions are not clear enough. It is capturing items I didn't expect it to.
3,Worked very well. Exceeded expectations. Covered everything. Very thorough. I have used it for the past 4 years and will continue.
2,"I really like the midi feature, the feedback mechanism is important, it has some weird fingering recommendations, I would use in conjunction with another book<br /><br />I hate the accompaniment, the demo songs play with full instrumentation, I want just the piano, a miss."
3,"On the whole, Turbo Tax Deluxe is very good tax software, user friendly and quite accurate. There is one important exception in regard to one of the allocations in the Iowa state tax calculation. This allocation does not follow the clear instructions for the Iowa return, and the Turbo Tax calculation results in a major distortion of the resultant tax. Luckily, Turbo Tax permits the user to override and insert the correct allocation. I have provided the details twice in letters to Turbo Tax, without consequent correction of the software."
1,"I've used TurboTax for almost 10 years.  Pricing change is deceptive at best.  Last year i remember being up sold near the end for being able to pay out of my refund or having TurboTax do something for me.  It even charged me for my &#34;Free&#34; state return.  That was all fine, but this is manipulative.  I imagine they thought, &#34;Get them to start their taxes. No one wants to start over.&#34;  My decision is not to purchase TurboTax this year despite wanting to use the consistent platform I've been using for almost 10 years, due to the deceptive nature  and size of the price increase."
2,We use this software every year and always have great success with it. That was until this year. This year it took way longer than usual to do our taxes and then after we finally got done we have to wait three days until they fixed a bug and then wait another three days to fix another bug. We were very unhappy and might not get this software next year.
3,"Always have thought this is the best alternative to Photoshop. Not too expensive, and fairly user friendly. Only annoying part is this company doesn't support versions that are old. But that's the same with pretty much everywhere so no complaints! I have been used this product since the first version, and will continue to. Recommend!"
0,it didn't work
3,"Easy to use, very intuitive."
1,"Sorry to say I wish I had bought Turbotax again afterall. H&R Block is simpler, clearer and easier to use for common forms. But little to no useful support or instructions for less common forms besides main 1040 and its schedules A-D, just the forms themselves to fill in online.  Downloaded data from Vanguard mutual funds didn't enter qualified dividends or capital gains, and downloaded some funds twice, so ended up being quicker to delete and enter by hand than to try to straighten out.  Not even a form for annualized estimated income."
2,"Lots of new bells and whistles, but also a lot of new glitches.  Had to call for help three times in the first week."
0,It automatically updated and I can't open any files now. Urrrgh. I waited and waiting to finally make the decision to upgrade and now this. I'm so disappointed in Intuit these days. The upgrades just seem to make things more difficult to do and now this total melt down.
3,There are some features the program lacks but for the most part it does what I need and is very affordable.
2,I don't want the download i want the package to be mailed
1,Too expensive
3,"I still love TurboTax. I only gave it 4 stars because I still think it's bogus that they removed so many of the basic forms from the Deluxe version. However, thankfully for me, the Deluxe version still works for me. I looked at the H&R Block software as well as Turbo Tax. I went with Turbo Tax again because I have used it for the last 10+ years to file my taxes. I also compared the screen shots on the H&R Block software to what I know of Turbo Tax, and I preferred the Turbo Tax format better. Many people criticize Turbo Tax for being elementary in its design and guidance. For me, that's precisely what I need. I like how it literally guides me through each section and deduction. It makes me feel confident in self-filing versus paying a pro major bucks. If my taxes get more complicated in the future and I'm forced to upgrade to the Premium edition at twice the cost, I'll revisit H&R Block. But for now, I'm sticking with the tried and true."
4,I have been using turbo tax for years and the version I got through Amazon was the best price....it is also the first time I downloaded the program rather than buy a CD....it was actually easier to download than to install the CD!
1,"I have yet to be able to transfer my Quicken for Windows to Quicken for Mac 2015.  I am very frustrated and would not buy this ... I keep getting outdated converter messages, so I download current converter and it still doesn't work.  I am familiar with computers so not sure where this is going wrong but I have tried it unsuccessfully numerous times...  not happy with this."
1,I am not happy with the product this year.  Too much hassles and consumer weren't told of the changes.  I will not buy this product again next year.
0,"Like many of you, I am forced to upgrade to this release because of threats that I will not be able to download data from my bank if I do not upgrade. There is no other reason to upgrade my perfectly good copy of Quicken 2011.<br /><br />I bought it and after download, it would not recognize my password. I use a password manager, which allows me to generate a very complex password with extended characters. I contacted someone on their chat line, who wasted about an hour of my time (10 minutes between responses in the chat window) to tell me he would have to escalate my problem.<br /><br />In the meantime, I uninstalled 2014, reinstalled 2011 and set my password to a very simple one. I reinstalled 2014 and it opened with this simple password. After that I reset the 2014 password to the same complex password as before and it works just fine. It seems that their initial open process will not recognize complex passwords.<br /><br />I expect some form of testing when I pay for software like this. Apparently Intuit does not really test. As far as I am concerned, they owe me money for wasting about two hours of my time on a Sunday."
0,"It's not working properly, I'm unable to download it."
2,This upgrade from 2006 is pretty good but the interface is a little hard to get used to. The reports are better than 2006.
0,"This advertisement implies that state tax service is included in the purchase price.  However, once I completed my federal return the program prompted me to enter my credit card number and was requiring another 43 dollars in addition to the purchase price of the turbo tax + state + efile software.  I am extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with this issue."
3,Use H&R BLOCK Software every year. Never had any problems.
4,"So... I looked earlier at all the negative reviews regarding this product, and decided to try out the H&R Block software this year.  That was January 19, and I wasted the next 5 weeks trying to get their software to work (see that review, if interested).<br /><br />I finally gave up this morning and downloaded Turbo Tax.  That was at approximately 9:40 a.m.  At 11:00 a.m., my taxes were done and filed.  I'm not sure what the previous issue was, but it sure didn't impact me.<br /><br />I will never second-guess my previous experience again, and TurboTax has a customer for life."
1,"Disappointing - we've used TT for years, but may switch next year.  Why?  The various 'upgrades' are less user-friendly.  The most annoying is TT's default for having to go thru their website in order to print out anything.  For our extension we actually went to the IRS website to download the form - TT wouldn't let us do that without going thru the website - ridiculous.  We've been printing out all the forms before without that extra step.  We'll see what happens when we complete the forms -"
4,Just as advertised.  Highly recommended.
4,Best of antivirus solutions!
3,"I totally trust Turbo Tax to correctly file my tax returns. The program has gotten so &#34;user friendly&#34; that I no longer understand what is being put where; I feel out of control. I try to make up for this with reviewing the return before submitting it. On balance, I will continue to use Turbo Tax."
1,"Disappointing features; extremely long wait times for customer support; 3-day wait for tier II response to my problem; and I am still waiting to hear beck from tier III.  I gave up waiting, re-keyed the parts of the interview that I think the program was screwing up the handling of, and went ahead and filed.<br /><br />FEATURES<br />I enjoy being able to right-click an see how either an interview question or a field on a form links to other parts of the return.  More often than not, there is no information available when clicking to this option.  Very frustrating when trying to track calculations or learn something about the forms/code/rules.<br />Related, context-sensitive help lacks linkage to context-specific tax rules--just refers to general pubs.<br /><br />What a joke that I can file federal (relatively complicated) returns electronically at no extra charge, but the company wants to charge me $19+ to file the relatively calculation-free State return.<br /><br />CUSTOMER SUPPORT<br />Support technicians I spoke with on the phone--and one via online chat--were truly concerned and responsive, but were as puzzled as I was when they reproduced my problem on copy of my return I had uploaded to them and unable to resolve, elevating my problem report to the next level.<br /><br />I have done my taxes for years on excel spreadsheets I have set up for the purpose, going through and changing formulas annually to reflect changes I tax code/rules/values. I thought that I would try one of the well-rated products to give myself a break, and to (later) compare my own calculations to as a baseline for possible future reliance on my spreadsheets.<br /><br />Mistake.<br /><br />I spent too much time on hold (40 minute wait time initially before hanging up.  40 mins another time before contact and another hour on phone (most of it on hold) with tech trying to look things up. another 30+ mins waiting for agent on chat. and ditto the wait and call times when contacting tier II.<br/><br />As a courtesy, the agents ask when is a good time for return calls to be made (for tier II and then tier III to get back to me.  I told them &#34;now&#34; or late in evening (when I am free).  When tier II called back, it was middle of afternoon, leaving msg.  so I of course had to get on hold again when I got home and could call back. (Why ask when is a good time to call back, and create an expectations gap?)<br /><br />The problem:<br />donating a vehicle as one of 8 non-cash charitable donations.  Following the interview, which asks for clothing etc. first, the vehicle ended up as item &#34;f&#34;\ which placed it on the second copy of the form along with two others.  Tier III is charged with figuring out why this may have contributed to a rejection of the return for E-filing and I may learn someday, but my, tier I and tier II attempts to follow steps on the rejection report to regenerate the respective form resulted in identical rejection codes. deleting and re-keying the vehicle donation did not address it. I thought to try and get the vehicle on to the FIRST copy of the form, so I deleted enough contributions so that I only had 3 clothing-based ones, THEN skipped ahead in the interview to key in a vehicle (which became donation &#34;d&#34;, on the first copy of the form) before keying in the other clothing and then other donations in sequence after that.<br />That worked, and the e-file was then accepted.<br /><br />I had speculated with tier II that trying to get the vehicle onto the first form might be a workaround.<br />Do you think HRBlock might pay me a the consulting fee for pointing them toward where the bug in their software is?<br />I might be happy with a phone call back from tier III someday, but I think I will have to settle for simply asking for my money back.<br />but I have not checked the return in my spreadsheets yet, so a refund might waive my right to audit support if the software screwed something else up on my return! [snark!]"
1,"It wasn't nearly as detailed with covering specific deductions as Turbo Tax is and in the end, my return was less. My fault for filing and not running it through another program to be sure it was concise. I only tried it this year because Turbo Tax was having major error issues that have since been corrected. Next year....back to Turbo Tax I go."
1,"I've used Quicken since before it became Quicken. Oh for the good old days! To be honest there have been many improvements over the years. I generally don't buy each release because there isn't that many improvements to warrant it. It's been a few years and I was interested in the mobile app that works with 2013 so I made the move. I'm really sorry I did. The app doesn't have some of the basic functionality I would expect, such as the ability to split a transaction. Wouldn't you think this just might be something a devoted customer would want? There are many checkbook register apps out there people can use otherwise!<br /><br />But one of my big surprises and disappointments had to do with the savings goal interface. I've grown to use this feature over the years and although the module hasn't improved much, like letting you sort the goals alphabetically, at least you could see the data fairly easily. Now I don't know if the change took place in the 2013 release or one prior, but what were the developers thinking!!!? I've looked under Settings to see if I can customize the view but so far no luck. It may be pretty with colors and graphs but it 'aint good for seeing the numbers at a glance!<br /><br />If you're a long time user of Quicken disappointment may be in store if you buy 2013. If I could roll back I would."
0,"Total disappointment in H&R BLOCK. This program is flawed in more than one way!!! I have been doing my own taxes for over 5 years now, and I decided to &#34;try&#34; this out since I was a huge fan of H&R block in my younger less experienced tax days.  This was the WORST decision I've ever made financially everyone's taxes u did that year got audited!!!??? Coincidence? I doubt it, I let someone see as an example what they would get if they claimed 2 children, than deleted the child from the dependents screen, it normally (with turbo tax) erases the child from every form on the return without needing to go through the entire process over again, but not this program, with this program you manually have to go through every page to make for sure the information had been completely deleted from the return.  Not to mention other functions that should be automatic!!?? What's wrong with H&R Block I am quite positive this will NOT become a favorite for those who choose to do their own taxes!!!<br />UPDATE FEBRUARY 21,2017 (ORIGINAL PURCHASE DATE OF JANUARY 5TH, 2013)<br />I bought the h&r block at home deluxe plus state. I wanted a copt of that particular years tax return now (4yrs later) because that's the only yr I had problems with my taxes. I went to the website and they will NOT give me (or allow me to view) the copy because it says I used the free version of H&R Block software? ?? So they want me to pay $9.99 for me to view my own information! ? AFTER I PAID FOR THEIR BS PRODUCT & GOT AUDITED FOR NO REASON! !!... not only that but it also says view my 2011 taxes ..... umm i bought this in 2013 obviously for the prior yr 2012? So why should i even pay for these tac documents from h&r block from 2011 when I DIDN'T EVEN FILE WITH THEM IN ANY SHAPE FORM OR FASHION EXCEPT IN 2012!? SO EXACTLY what 2011 tax documenrs for $9.99 are they referring to??? These people are CROOKS!"
1,"I am finding a lot of issues with this program. It is no better than mint.com, which I am not impressed with either. It does not download the transactions properly. I recently updated my accounts and it showed my account balances correct on the left column but when you open each account it shows a negative and has items adding or subtracting in the wrong direction even though they are correctly labeled as a debit or credit.<br /><br />Also, my car loan is not updated correctly. It shows that I owe $5000 more than I do an when I look at my online account it shows the correct balance.<br /><br />I bought this because it was supposed to be user friendly but I find it has major issues and can't handle transfers."
3,"What can I say?  Installed easy, and it is a good product.  worth the money, and we are happy with it.<br /><br />Thank you!!"
0,It won't install  I just wasted my money!
2,"Not bad, but it does not include basic investment sales.  The deluxe edition should include sales of mutual funds.  I had to pay the increase for the premier version just for the sale of some mutual funds..."
2,"I had a malware in my computer which display a voice ad either at startup or in mid session. So i contact webroot and i told them kaspersky had a tool to remove it but i dont like them so i want to know if webroot have it. They asked me if i download the kaspersky tool, come on, they are your competitor and you ask me to download their tool then why dont i buy the software from kaspersky ?  Next time i will buy bitdefender."
1,"I wanted to protect not only my two computers, but also both android devices.  I have to say, that Norton has returned to its days of bloatware again.  They had a product about ten years ago, then went through a period of bloat in which I switched to a different product.  Norton then improved for a couple years, but they seem to be getting worse and worse.  I uninstalled from both my android devices as they were both running intolerably slow.  Slow screen response to slow software activation.  Keep in mind both my phone and tablet are the premium Samsung devices on the market, and now run like it again.<br />The bloatware within the Chrome browser also was beyond a problem in Windows OS.  Had to disable all the Chrome extensions.<br /><br />Pretty sure I'm going to switch to something different and get a refund."
4,Virus detection is very good thanks to Kasperksy for so good protection
1,"required software upgrade, then another call to tech support for another fix.  Turbotax is losing its edge big time"
2,I really don't know how to rate this product as I (mistakenly) clicked on the iBank5 downloaded product and I got a &#34;HELPER&#34; and I couldn't stop it. It only had a continue button and no way to pause or come back later. It was nearly  midnight and it wouldn't let me go and come back tomorrow. All I could do is force it to quit. The following morning I tried to figure out how to work the installation and the &#34;HELPER&#34; wouldn't come back and I had no way of knowing what to do. I therefore went to Quicken for my iMac and I did get that to work.
4,"Extremely happy with the Apache software. Has feeling of older Excel and saved my lots of headache with Microsoft restoring corrupted documents for a 'nominal' fee...easy to use, both document and spreadsheet...still learning!"
2,"I ordered this for my computer to use when I travel. It's fairly strenuous (for me who hasn't worked out that much in the last year), but then you can always do the movements at a lower intensity level. After doing my version of the routine, I definitely felt that I had done something. I did decide however, that I really prefer something like Zumba where there's music and movement. This Body Weight Circuit training could be something to use in between Zumba or something more fun.  I think the movements are worthwhile, I just needed something more motivating personally."
1,Have used Turbo Tax for about 10 years now. I have always got the version with the Federal included and paid for the state. This year I could not get my computer to connect with the filing. It forced me to pay an extra $35 over the purchase of the state by taking the money out of the refund. Probably will try Tax Cut next year. Like cheating your loyal customers out of extra money for their bottom line.
2,"Worked fine - but I think it's very expensive as an annual expenditure, plus the additional costs your get charged for filing and bank transfers."
4,good product  very happy
1,OVER PRICED. The software work as it should except for one glitch which I found a work around for. I switched to H&R Block for my personal tax and it worked just find. It was easy to transfer my last years filings over. I will be using H&R Block software for my partnership next year. Washing my hands of the Intuit Mafia.
2,"The download process at Amazon works well.  I'm not thrilled about the latest version of this H&R Block at Home 2010 Deluxe.  The Deduction Pro is online.  Deduction Pro is painful for charitable contributions.  You also can't edit it once you've completed an entry if it has more than 50 items in it.  I had to go back and edit it because I had the wrong year on a contribution (the calender doesn't default to 2010).  It won't allow you to edit the date or any items if there are more that 50 items in it.  That's rediculous.  I had to delete the entry and create a new one.  Finding the donated items in their drop down lists is slow and painful.  Reentering over 50 items is a giant waste of my time.  Once completed, you then tell the H&R program where the downloaded 'deduction pro' file is.  I have yet to find the web link (again) in the program to get to the Deduction Pro website."
3,I don't recall seeing a bonus!!
1,"Got a few malware off from my computer but I bought this specifically to remove coupon giant malware and things related to it after being told by multiple people that it will work, yet after multiple times of scanning among other things, the CouponGiant  crap is still there. Anyone know how to get rid of it?"
2,Good
1,keeps popup wanting me to buy more
0,"I have read the Intuit explanation of why schedule D is no longer on TurboTax deluxe.<br /><br />But what I fail to see is an understanding from Intuit that TurboTax customers have been customers probably out of loyalty. There are many more products out there, compared to when many of us starting using TurboTax when it was available only as a 3.5 in floppy disk. We purchased many years out of brand loyalty, and then with very little announcement of change, schedule D is no longer on Deluxe.<br /><br />OK Intuit, you are justifying the change, it get it. You are also explaining that we should have read the bullet points. OK. I read it now, and I'll remember it next year. But next year it won't be with Intuit."
2,"I was a little skeptical of the Mac version but it is almost the same as the windows.  Only downfall is that you need to do Payroll online and it is totally different then he window version.  If you have a problem with the payroll, be prepared to call India. Very hard to communicate with them.  That is why it only gets 4 stars.  Dont understand why they done just set it up like Windows Payroll"
2,"So, for what is worth, QuickBooks is losing its edge. Don't get me wrong, its a great accounting platform. But, as an ITSP/MSP, I see less and less demand for desktop cloud software. Most of my clients either use QuickBooks online or Xero.  I don't feel link QB online competes with Xero because Xero gives you an all inclusive platform and unlimited users at a per company cost."
3,"I don't have the time to write an extensive review but I want to reassure any person who is worried about purchasing this download based on prior reviews that you don't need to be worried. I have used the Taxcut software for years (seven or eight years). It is always a little less expensive than turbotax and I find the software to be very easy to follow and I feel that I always get my maximum refund. I was cautious since the softward has changed from Taxcut to H & R Block At Home but it is identical to what I was used to.  Key Highlights  *Amazon's software downloader was problem-free, fast, and easy  *Software imported my 2009 data from my computer - saved me lots of time  *DeductionPro is now online - interview takes you to it and it is easier than the 2009 version of DeductionPro  *Efile is still easy, free, and fast  *State software was downloaded when I prompted - fast, quick, easy.  *Software warned me that it may take longer to get refund since IRS is not accepting returns with itemized deductions until mid-Feb. I was happy to be warned of this possibility since otherwise I would have been angry that my refund wasn't processing like in years past.    The only reason why I give this software 4 out of 5 stars is because I still think that tax software is not 100% reliable as speaking with a CPA or real live person who does your taxes. I do have a couple of questions and although the software does answer it to the best of its ability, I sometimes worry that I'm making a mistake or not doing my return correctly. It is always a risk I take and so far I have not had any problems with the IRS or any personal tax liability issues so I believe I'm doing my taxes correctly. It is just nice I had the option of a person reviewing my return just to make 100% sure."
4,"This is the second year I've used the H&R Block Tax software Deluxe + State and am even better pleased this year than last.  I found that this product gives valuable tips that saved me paying more tax than I was obliged to do.  Definitely get the state tax software package since there are differences between what deductions the Federal rules allow versus what the state allows and the Block product helps to capture each deduction.  My only negative would be how long I needed to wait to &#34;chat&#34; with a tax professional and, after waiting for a half hour, &#34;chatting&#34; with her for another half hour, she tells me my question required a &#34;tax professional.&#34;  I told her I thought that was what she was and she said &#34;no&#34; she was able to assist with questions about the software but not about tax rules and she needed to get me to someone else - for whom I had to wait another half hour!"
0,"I have used turbotax for years on the PC and have always loved it.  The mac version looks just the same, but it DOES NOT work with quickbooks for mac.  You cannot import data from quickbooks at ALL.  Quickbooks for MAC will not generate a .txf file  that contains transaction data so if you want to use your data?  You have to PRINT IT OUT AND ENTER IT BY HAND.<br /><br />They do go so far as to say that they have some nifty tables that you can print out to make your EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL TASK a little easier.  yippee.<br /><br />So go back to the PC version.  This is just a mockery."
4,I was able to complete my TurboTax form is less than two hours without using a  single pencil or scratch pad. And every year Turbo manages to find a least two hundred dollars more than what I would have hadif I had done these taxes the old fashioned way. Thanks TurboTax
4,Great.
1,"I have relied on Quicken for years. Each year's update/upgrade has been incremental...but good. This last one, 2013 was abysmal. It should never have been released/sold as it was not ready. There were many problems, e.g., duplicate entries, strange balances, and the app version didn't agree with the PC version...odd, perplexing, and shouldn't happen. Inuit, since then, released several updates. Each one has brought it closer to what it should have been in the beginning. I hope that 2014's offering will be thoroughly tested and works as intended and needed. When so many depend on this program and pay for it...it simply should work coming out of the gate."
1,I would love to get a full iPad version so I do not have to be linked to my PC.
0,"This was NOT as advertised and did NOT include Scedule C as promised.  We want our money back!!  Turbo Tax has screwed up big time. We are switching.  Spent most of Saturday morning and evening of a holiday weekend to get this resolved.  NO RESOLUTIONS,"
1,"had 2010 version. ran out of space i guess, had to upgrade to 2013. BAD IDEA. Q should not hold a gun to your head and force you to buy an upgrade (lest you can never get your transactions again). the only way to get data from 2010 to 2013 was to open 10 highlight all transactions then open 13 and paste everything into new product, then setup 13 to do a onetime update on your account. make sure to get user names and passwords correct in 13 otherwise you just started a new account. time wise it took about 10 hrs to do. 1 phone call to Q did not help, 2nd gave me ideas about cut/paste method. Q NEEDS TO GIVE UPDATES AT REDUCED RATES!!!"
3,We have done our personal monthly finances by hand for years but decided to change over to Quicken. Very easy to use and the automatic bank data updates is perfect.
4,I use turbo tax for many years and continue being very please with the quality of its product and accuracy of the results
3,Had some trouble installing because the free taxact and the delux with state are the same item. So fake credentials I created to test the free edition caused trouble. But then installing the state was a a separate product requiring a new registration. It's fair.
0,"I was only able to have my daughter take the first lesson... after that I only get an error message. &#34;TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.&#34;<br />I have ran a compatibility test with every version of Windows AND made sure my acrobat was completely up to date.<br />Not sure what is wrong, but now I am out the money and my daughter still needs a typing program."
0,"Intuit's change to standard features of its TurboTax Basic program has led to complaints it effectively raised prices for many of its users. One major change is taxpayers with Schedule A now must use the higher-priced TurboTax Premier. And competitor H&R Block is trying to capitalize on what it hopes is the anger of TurboTax customers.<br /><br />&#34;If you need to itemize on Schedule A, you'll need to use TurboTax Deluxe,&#34; an Intuit spokesperson acknowledges. &#34;Customers in this situation will pay more this year vs. last year.&#34; However, customers with concerns or questions are being urged to contact TurboTax and &#34;we'll work with them on a case-by-case basis.&#34;  She says the changes bring the desktop product in line with the features offered in the similar edition of TurboTax Online &#34;As more customers move from TurboTax desktop to Online to mobile solutions, this change creates a more consistent experience across TurboTax products and platforms,&#34; she says<br /><br />Similarly, those who have purchased TurboTax Deluxe find they have to buy the more expensive TurboTax Premier to get the ability to electronically files schedules. C, D, E and F. While those using the forms input method can complete those schedules, electronic filing is no longer included.<br /><br />Arch competitor H&R Block countered offering buyers free copies of Deluxe + State desktop software if they have already purchased TurboTax Basic or Deluxe. Block says that those forced to move from TurboTax Basic to Deluxe are paying $40 more while the software it is offering them costs $19.95, giving the TurboTax Basic subscribers access to Schedule A.  Block also has a similar offer for TurboTax Deluxe clients to move to of H&R Block Deluxe + State. The Block product includes access to Schedules C and D. State users will receive a 10-percent refund bonus on a federal refund when the taxpayer puts some or all of their refund on e-gift cards."
0,This product did absolutly nothing to clean my registry..Cant even get them to email me back...Don't waste your money . I want mine back
1,I cannot get the software installed. It keeps rolling back on installation and the troubleshooting instructions are not helpful.
4,priced right and convenient.
0,"I purchased this because I wanted the complete version of this software and the description did not indicate that it was only a trial version, which I already had.  After I downloaded it and it installed, it wanted the activation code to run fully.  I checked everywhere I could think of to find this code which Amazon says that if a activation code is needed it will be in the software library.  It wasn't there and all I could find was the link to the company writing the software, telling you that you could get the full version for about $35.00.  I am not at all happy that I downloaded this and would like to get my money back"
2,"I've used Sony Vegas in the past so I can only compare it to that and in comparison, Platinum is well, meh. Sony still needs to fix the interface. The video preview window is still super jittery, even on a very powerful machine and rendering takes FOREVER!. Its ok for field editing on a laptop."
0,"Beware! From a loyal amazon user of years and years...this is NOT an instant download. Amazon will make you wait 4 + hours to download software unless you're a \\""frequent\\"" software purchaser. You're better off going to microsoft and buying it from them. I've really always loved amazon, but I truly can't believe the situation they put me through for this. Not only did they not offer me the digital download, they locked out my account for trying to buy this program. I was using my same credit card, same billing address, and same login as i had used YESTERDAY to buy another item in the same electronics section of the store. I even called my credit card company who reported there were no problems with my card and all was clear - it was 100% amazon's decision.<br /><br />BEWARE. I've never had to say this before, but amazon is not clear on the fact that you won't get this product as an instant digital download."
1,easy to download but I could never get anything accomplished with it.  was never able to get a card saved or printed.
4,I had to get this for school. Love the fast down load!
0,"Purchasing the update was easy.  The process for starting the upgrade was not clear.  I had to go find the code to use for the update.  Got past that, then was told there wasn't enough space on my unit to load the North America map.  Went to the Garmin site for support.  Found nothing that helped (delete unused voice files.)  Found some other information on the internet that said to delete the map file.  This was a 1 gb file.  Delete that and the upgrade starting running.  The update then failed.  Went to start it again and got the space warning again.  I ended up just loading the east coast as that is what I needed.  The reason I wanted the update was because the last time I drove through North Carolina, there were new sections of rt 17 that the device did not know about.  After the update, the device still doesn't have these roads that are not over 2 years old.  Waste of money for me."
2,QB is a good software but there are many things that they need to fix.   Its been 5 years and they still have issues with the UI. Seems to me after this long they would have this fixed.
3,"I have been a quicken user since 1995 and have gone through numerous upgrades and all they entail.  I have always been a big fan of quicken and have come to expect seamless and easy transitions from one version to the next.  Transitioning from Q10 to Q13 brought one major disappointment so far in that my laboriously created 2013 personal budget did not transition without some strange errors.  It was relatively easy to see what was wrong with the new budget presentation layout.  Some expense categories had been moved to the Income Group of categories and all categories in the income group had been arbitrarily divided into two separate income groups, one labeled \\""income\\"" and the other labeled \\""personal income\\"".  And, these two groups were separated in the budget presentation by the expense group!  It was difficult to correct this as the system would not let me do the obvious \\""fix\\"" which would be to move the incorrectly grouped category back to expenses and put all the income categories together in one group.  Happily, I stumbled across an indirect solution that appears to have fixed everything.  In summary, I'm a long time user whose faith has been somewhat shaken by a flawed transition to the upgrade version.  Hopefully, there will be no more gremlins still to come to the surface as I'm only about three weeks into Q13."
0,"Unable to convert all transaction data from Microsoft Money, so inaccurate and incomplete historical reporting. Going back to Money instead, despite lack of ongoing support."
4,I did my son and daughter taxes and both were accurate and the e-file was included.  I would highly recommend this product in order to save money for someone during your taxes.
4,I have used this software for 4 years
0,No control over how every time I went on line this program tried to connect to bank.<br />Uninstalled it one or two days after install and asked for refund.<br />Still waiting!
3,"I'm gradually learning how to use Publisher. It is much better than the card program I was using to make the first draft of the brochure for St Patrick Parish<br />The ideas and the availability of the &#34;on line pictures&#34; is quick and exciting for my creativity.<br /><br />Although, I spent a day and a half with the problem of installing it in my computer, I was gratified by the refund given to me.<br />Thank you so much,<br />Cece"
0,"I would not purchase this product from Amazon or any other retailer.  The reward is simply not worth the risk.  The program does not work and customer service is virtually non-existent.  I had been a happy Quicken user for a few years before moving on to another product.  After a couple years, I decided to purchase Quicken 2012 when it was released on Amazon.  I don't feel that my accounts were that difficult to set up: a few checkings/savings, a couple retirement accounts, a simple brokerage account, a rental property and mortgage, and some student loans.  The setup was easy and the product worked well for two weeks.    However, on 10/18/11, I received my first error when attempting to download data from PNC bank.  After playing around with online support and user forums, I sent a request to customer service.  Over the past 2.5 months, I have sent the log files roughly a dozen times since they can't seem to keep track of them.  I have also chatted online with support as well as phone conversations.  Finally, two weeks ago, I got someone on the phone and after an hour, we were able to download the transactions.  The next day, the errors returned and service has been unable to help me since.  In total, as of 12/28/11, I have been unable to use quicken for ~10 out of the 12 weeks that I've owned the program, sent dozens of emails, and spent hours trying to solve the problem.  The only reason I have put this much effort is that Amazon does not refund money for downloadable software, and there is no viable competitor (since Mint is now owned by Intuit).  I do not recommend purchasing this product under any condition."
3,"Hmmm - well, I did a lot of research on various home financial software packages, and it seemed that they all fell into one of two categories: either the minimalist approach (like a simple checkbook ledger) or the \\""complete financial solution\\"". I needed something in between, and this version of Quicken seems to do the trick. I have two checking accounts, one personal, one for my HSA, and hooking up to them was relatively painless. I was able to add a savings account a month later with no problem at all. I hit the one click update about once a week and it seems to go very well every time. The program generally gets the categories right, with a reasonable amount of editing afterward.<br /><br />I would like more latitude in editing account information. The bank only saves transactions for a few months, and I had exported my account transactions as QIF files before I bought the program, and I had planned to import them into my checking account once I got the software - but that's not possible. I had to start a \\""Cash\\"" account to be able to see the transactions in the exported files. I'd probably give it 5 stars, except for that."
1,"Like many, I have been a satisfied user of TurboTax Deluxe since the early 90's.  But this year I plan to give H&R Block a try.  I need Schedule C, D and K-1 and the ability to E-file but am not willing to pay the additional money to get them from TurboTax.  I'm sure TurboTax will continue to serve you well if you have a very simple return.  I am glad I noticed the poor rating this year before making my purchase.  I would have been very upset if I had purchased TurboTax and stumbled onto these changes while preparing my return."
0,"As a retired Enrolled Agent I am appalled that the industry leader in tax preparation software would remove functionality while maintaining the price of the deluxe edition.  No matter how you spin it Mr. Meighan, this is nothing more than a blatant attempt to extort more money from customers by forcing them to buy a more expensive product.  You really expect to charge $30 more to efile a return with a single line entry on Schedule D?  In the past I have recommended TurboTax for clients that do not need professional tax preparation.  In good conscience I can no longer do that."
1,Did not run on my computer windows 8.  Non tech support.  Stay away reason it's only a 2-3 star product.
4,Turbo Tax is an excellent tax program.  I have used it for years.
4,I always use NIS.  Can't beat the price here on Amazon either.  Solid product.
4,good
1,Use caution when you decide to purchase this download. Mine was half way complete when it just got tired and quit. Trying to revive it caused my computer to lock up. Re-booting lost the one-half download. Beginning again wasn't an option as I hadn't received a software user license at that time.
1,"A note since there are only 2 reviews here so far: I'm not sure why the Quickbooks 1-user version reviews are not included here as it appears to be the same software just in a 3-pack license. There are many (mostly negative) reviews of this software at<br />[[ASIN:B003YJ8WFE QuickBooks 2011 for Mac]]<br />In a nutshell, if you are \\""stuck\\"" with Quickbooks because you are upgrading and it would be too much trouble to start over with different accounting software, then this 2011 version might keep you going another couple years. If you are just starting out on a search for what business/finance software to buy, do some more research as there are excellent alternatives to Quickbooks. For multiple reasons, Intuit/Quickbooks are not winning many friends in the Mac world. Don't take my word for it, just read the other reviews.<br /><br />In either case, don't buy the software without doing first getting the FREE TRIAL you can download from the Intuit/Quickbooks site. You'll get 30 days or 15 uses or whatever they currently have set up to decide for yourself if it'll work for you or not."
2,"If you just have a mortgage two jobs and a simple write-offs or an HSA, good program.<br /><br />It gets confusing if you have a home office, but work for an employer and or have a side business as well.  The interview gets to be a little off from that point.<br /><br />Seems like employee remote offices have been around for a while, but I think for what they charge further adjusting the interview for more scenarios, that are relatively common would make the product a better than the others.<br /><br />On the buying end I only re-buy this product for the year to year accurate data transfer."
1,"After reading many, many reviews, I decided to wait to purchase the 2014 version.  I use my quicken basically as a computerized checkbook because the functionality they provide has always been buggy in the beginning.  I don't have time to spend hours on a computer trying to get a product to work.  Very frustrating  because I paid for a product that should work from the beginning. It's like buying a bike with no pedals.  As long as I can keep tracking and reconciling, that'll be all I will be doing with quicken.  I don't want to try the phone apps because I just don't trust them."
4,"excellent antivirus program, lightweight use, don't make your device slowly...."

2,"The software is okay.  The only thing is that there is no longer an update.  However, TurboTax customer service was superb at helping me.  I explained that I needed to use the old software to prepare taxes going back 7 years for an elderly person with dementia who had stopped having taxes done.  TurboTax did everything necessary to help me get the 2008 taxes done even though the update did not work."
1,"I've used Quicken for 20 years, first on a Windows machine, then on a Mac using virtualization software. As the life-cycle of my 2012 Windows version was coming to an end, I thought I'd give the &#34;new and improved&#34; Mac version a try. About six weeks in, it was a mistake. My home finances, tracked to the penny for years, are now off by thousands. Downloads don't work right, automatic entries don't enter correctly, and don't get me started on reconciliation. At this point, I'd like to see an option to trade in my Mac 2015 version for the Windows 2015 version.<br /><br />Which begs the question, why not one star? If you're a new Quicken user, it wouldn't be a terrible product, and much better than the previous version. And, in just the few weeks I've had it, there have been a lot of marginal improvement. It could be a useful products some day, but I think it was just released too soon with too many flaws. Taken with the TurboTax issues going on, I suspect Intuit has lost its moral compass and is in need of better leadership."
3,"I have been using TurboTax for years. I always get excellent returns...both owing and getting refunds, depending on my financial situation in a given year. This year I moved to a state that charges State income tax. It automatically downloaded the State tax return without an extra fee. I was wondering how to go about that, but TurboTax did everything for me. I will continue to use this tax preparation software. It hasn't failed me yet. By the way, the electronic filing is free. If you do the direct deposit, you get your refund back in a week or so!"
0,"I have come to rely on turbo tax software to do home and business taxes. And i bought 2014 tt despite reviews to stay away because the company publically apologized and said they had corrected problems. And other tax programs are an unknown. BUT i regret that decision. 2014 is awful. Dont buy it. Difficult, spotty, and makes me wonder if my tax documents are correct!! I am considering buying another program to see if the results are correct to another software. In any event. Dont buy tt 2014."
4,The best free antivirus in my opinion never had a virus to date
4,MoneyDance is an excellent system that meets my needs and more. Since moving from MS Money I have been looking for a suitable replacement that has an iPad app. After several attempts I saw MoneyDance on a review site and downloaded the free trial and was instantly hooked. The support is excellent too.
1,Have been using Quicken for nearly 30 years and find it very useful in managing the financial part of my life.  This version works but it seems slower than the previous version I had (2012).  Would not have upgraded if not for the Intuit policy of disabling on line account access after a period of time.  Nothing else in this version is worth it.  Oh well?
2,"Got this for my college freshman.  It was not as bad a deal as I expected.  I can put a copy on her laptop (succeeded) and her desktop (not yet done).  For $80 that is not too bad, except that it expires after 4 years.  We have Office Home and Student 2007 (3 user) but she wanted the same version that was being used at school. I do plan to connect her laptop and desktop via live.com so that they share documents easily -- like Google apps on Chrome (I hope!).  I personally use Libre Office and that has worked fine for some time but I also use the free Office on live.com and of course Google apps which we use the most."
1,DO not buy your tax software until the last momemt. I bught this tax program two days ago and then today the price droped ten dollars. Amazon will not match price digital downloads so I feel like I was ripped off. Always wait until you must have the software then make sure you shop for the best deal. I always felt safe shopping Amazon.com until now.
3,"Does a good job, very good, almost too good.  Sometimes it seems to block too many sites, and needs to be dialed back a bit.  But it keeps the computer clean and running well."
1,"As almost everyone knows, Intuit really messed up with their rollout of the 2014 TurboTax versions. To add insult to injury, they overcharge $5 to e-file the California return. Within the tax software, it's advertised as $19.95. At the time of e-filing, it became $24.95. Yeah, it's only another $5, but in light of the other corporate stupidity and &#34;apologies&#34;, it just adds insult to injury. I've long wondered why they don't eliminate the state filing charge considering the price for the software. Intuit has grown to a corporate behemoth that actively lobbies the Federal government against revising the tax codes. I plan to change over to another tax software company come the 2015 tax filing season. I doubt they'll miss me even though I have used their software since they first debuted the Windows &#34;DOS&#34; versions."
0,"It downloaded a major income item twice and failed to download qualified dividends resulting in figuring my tax as 4 times what it it should be..<br /><br />Also, there was a problem in using it on my Mac. I phoned H&R Block for help and it took them 1/2 hour to come on the phone, an hour of explanations before the rep realized he did't know the answer, then another 10 minutes with another rep to solve the problem.<br /><br />After finding these problems I gave up on H&R Block and prepared my taxes with no problems using Turbotax Premiere as I should have done in the beginning."
1,It went up 19% from the 2012 edition.<br /><br />The amazon gift card looked promising.  The intuit web site said the max was $2000 per card and $10000 per customer in increments of $100.  My refund of $390 should have allowed me to do a $300 gift card.  The slider would only go from $0 to $100.  This is misleading & angers me.  I backed up & disallowed use of my tax info for the gift card.
4,"friendly user app. fast, smooth and efficient :)<br />I am not sure if it can be upgraded to Norton Internet Security 2014 but i still recommend this product for all windows users<br />jood job Norton"
0,I was charged $19.99 for state electronic filing. The electronic filing did not work and had to mail the state return. I've emailed and tried calling Intuit to get a refund for the $19.99. Email is not returned and no person answers the phone - just wait on hold.
0,"I purchased this product for my business as an upgrade from Quicken per my accountant's request.  The conversion from Quicken was anything but seamless. In fact, i still have not been able to convert even after attempting to work with \\""customer no-service\\"".  I called Quickbooks, they say its not their problem, call Quicken.  You guessed it, i called Quicken, they say its not their problem call Quickbooks.  THEY'RE OWNED BY THE SAME COMPANY!  i consider this purchase a waste of good money."
2,"I have used this Internet Security product before and found this download for the least money. It is from Amazon, so you can certainly trust the seller! It downloads in a very short time and goes right to work with little or no installation tasks. My only concern is it doesn't block the FBI virus."
4,"I absolutely love this package. I was using Photoshop (and taking a class in it) but it felt like using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut shell. PS is a great package for graphics design but for general photography, it's overkill.<br /><br />Lightroom greatly accelerated my editing time. I also took a video course from Phil Steele on using Lightroom which I'd highly recommend for the beginner.<br /><br />Converting from your old photo management software (iPhoto, in my case) was a bit of work, but it pays off. Just make sure you think through your file naming & keywording before you start.<br /><br />Highly recommend Lightroom 4!"
3,Very good easy to use served me good
3,Have used for several years and does the job.
4,"I needed to record video that was being streamed by a wedding photographer. I looked at several alternatives and decided on Movavi Screen Capture. Good decision. It is simple to use, produces high quality results, and it's versatile - I particularly like the many options for sound recording. Since then we have used Screen Capture on many occasions. Thoroughly recommended."

1,"I purchased H&R Block Premium Tax program in April 2011.  I downloaded the setup file from the seller's website.  This was the second year that I have used H&R Block.  This program proved to be a nightmare.  I installed the program from the downloaded file.  The 2010 program imported my info from the 2009 program.  When I was about one-third complete with my data entry, the program all of a sudden malfunctioned.  I could navigate through the pages of the program, however, the program ceased to allow me to enter any further information into the program.  I could not enter any numbers or words into the spaces required.  I called H&R Block Help Center's toll free number.  The customer service rep sent me another setup file to install the program anew.  I started my tax preparation again with moderate success only to find that when I tried to access the web to install program updates, my pc would not access the web.  Each time, AOL would \\""install files necessary to access the internet\\"" and then reboot my pc.  This happened several times repeatedly.  Finally, I printed an extension form and filed for an extension with the IRS via mail (The program would not allow me to file an extenson electronically).  I kept trying to make the program work.  Finally, the program started to function properly on April 18, 2011 at 9:00 p.m., three hours before the midnight filing deadline.  This is the last time that I will ever buy H&R Block.  I never had this problem with Turbo Tax.  I purchased H&R Block the past two years because it was significantly less expensive.  In the end, with the fees and interest to the IRS, the savings was not worth it.  I will never buy this product again or nor would I recommend it to anyone."
0,"The product is useless unless you have other software to operate it on. The customer service representative that helped me out was kind enough to issue a refund even though the policy is to not issue refunds on downloadable products so, it goes without saying, Amazon's Customer Service Department once again gets the highest marks possible. The CSR is also going to make sure that the wording on the advertisement is changed so that it is not misleading. I guess one star is a little harsh because the product may work great but I can not change it because of the misleading verbiage on the ad copy.  This is not Amazon's fault, they can only put what they are given by vendor."
2,Some issues as with most new releases?
0,It is hard to use for me
4,Great Program.  Definitely recommended.
3,"I like the new format it takes a little time to get use to it since I only use it for my checking, not much different to the old Quicken."
2,What a piece  of junk I purchased the nterntet suite... All I got for $33.00 was the free version of Antivirus and a trail version of speed up... What a rip off... do not buy this product
2,"Purchased today and the State did not seem to be included, despite the product data.  If you call Intuit, you can still get it for without paying the additional $39.99 that is being asked in the software.  Unfortunately, there was a long wait on hold to get through, but once you get someone, they were able to easily take care of me."
1,Canada map and support details are out of date<br />western Canada near Vancouver should be much better<br />You are missing the Golden ears Bridge.  You still think we swim across the Fraser river at maple ridge
0,"I developed a very effective personal accounting system based on Quicken 2010.  I used the account update features and developed a lot of my own ways of using Quicken.  I didn't need or want to upgrade other than because Intuit refused to continue the account update feature for Quicken 2010.<br />Upgrading was a BIG mistake.  Intuit has made changes to Quicken for no reason other than to make it look different -- just like the auto manufacturers do.  They are just changes - not improvements.  And they have completely messed up my personal accounting system.  Yes, they removed some columns I used and added others I don't need -- I can live with that.  It just takes a while to change the setup.<br />But the account update has made changes going back years and my accounts no longer reconcile.  I have to go back through every item (the update doesn't show which changes it made) to try to figure it all out -- it would take me forever.<br />I am going to return Quicken 2014, reinstall Quicken 2010, restore from a backup and then have to add all the recent changes back in.<br />WHAT A PAIN!  I will never upgrade Quicken again!<br /><br />POSTSCRIPT: To make matters worse, Quicken 2014 won't uninstall -- \\""fatal error on installation\\"" (sic) on trying to uninstall from Control Panel -- and same after each of 2 reboots.  And I can't reinstall Quicken 2010 without uninstalling 2014, so it looks like a hack of the registry is the only solution!"
3,I have used turbo tax deluxe for last 3 years. I was disappointed that this year's product did not recognize me or the info I inputted for 2013 taxes using same computer.
4,Not much I can say besides GREAT software for screen writing.
1,"I bought this program trying to upgrade from Windows Movie Maker thinking it would the next step for me to create better videos. But the constant freezing and crashing made editing a pain. When e-mailing customer service about the trouble I was experiencing, I received a, non-helpful, \\""thank you for buying our product\\"" and \\""upgrade to our newest version\\"" reply.  When the program wasn't freezing and halfway publishing videos, the variability of video effects is limited and re-sizing videos was unnecessarily difficult.  When considering buying this program after reading these reviews, it would be advantageous of a customer to think what would be a better choice: a program that has negative feedback and similar complaints or Sony Vegas which is much more versatile and fun to use for about the same price?"
4,Found it very easy to use and worry free.....
3,I prefer the online version.
2,Heavy on smaller PCs and laptops. It will slow down the processor.
1,"I've been using Quicken for over 15 years and this is the first time the company has let me down.<br /><br />First, it failed to import/update my data from the earlier version of Quicken.  I thought all my previous financial data had been lost.  I had to contact the company via the web chat feature through the web site.  The agent was eventually able to explain how to reset the data files (I was very happy I had made multiple backup copies of my data before attempting the software update).<br /><br />Second, several established methods of moving within the program/entering data have been changed without notice.  Having used the program for over 15 years, I am now struggling to navigate the program as easily as I did before.<br /><br />Still a great program overall.  It's.just too bad the upgrade experience was far from satisfactory."
4,"Seems to nail everything the internet (and irresponsible browsing, not mine :) ) can throw at it."
1,"After spending at least an hour attempting to download this, I finally was able to install this with some help from the Norton website.  Then randomly yesterday I received notice that I did not have anti virus protection, so I again had to download it.  I will admit to not being the most computer savvy however in the past when I bought this product from other sites I had no issues downloading and installing."
1,Very disappointed that I cannot load old records
3,Just as described
0,"I have, until now, purchased each new edition of Office Home and Student for our 3 computers.  That ends with this edition. No way will we buy 3 copies.  We will be using the old 2010 Office and free Open Office programs from now on, or, possibly, switching to Apple products the next time we buy computers. The Apple is more expensive, but applications much more reasonable with family-friendly sharing.  Microsoft seems determined to keep losing ground to their competitors.  By the way, if you haven't tried Open Office (<...>)or LibreOffice (<...>) an almost identical free program, give them a serious look.  You can do just about everything you can do in MS Office and save it in MS Office formats.  Since it is free, you can also save a document in the Open/Libre Office format and send it to friends who can also download the free program to read and edit.  Open/Libre Office also includes a database and drawing program in addition to the usual word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation programs.  Both programs are also available for Mac computers. Google Docs is another free option for simple documents, but doesn't offer many formatting or custom options.  It is, however, great for interactive collaborative projects."
3,I am an attorney and I use this product a great deal for video interrogations and video depositions. Being able to present video clips during trials is very effective.
0,It sucks
0,I bought this hoping for an easy office solution on Saturday. I purchased this for Excel.  Unfortunately Excel  doesn't work.  Typical. Tried to call Microsoft Tech Support - no answer.  Of course.  Tried to email tech support - invalid address.Of course.  What a piece of crap and non refundable to boot.
3,"I use excel, word, and powerpoint for school.  Kind of stupid that microsoft tries to get you to buy a new microsoft office with every device.  However, microsoft being an evil money-grubbing corporation is no new news.  With this one you at least get to put it on a couple of different devices.  If you don't want one of the free alternatives, buy this one."
2,it download as a demo and need activation key sent as email to upgrade to working program took some time to realize that
2,"Thanks for all the head's up on this year's Turbo Tax (from Intuit).  I'm ticked off as well...  BUT...  Intuit will work with you to get a Premium Version download if you complain hard enough (I've used H&R Block before and am willing to go back in a minute).  After many options (involving more MONEY than I'm used to paying for the Deluxe version--which is all I've needed for Schedule D and itemized deductions), the help desk person granted me a download of the Premier version.  I had to create an on-line account (which he helped me through), and the download showed up in &#34;My Account&#34;.  (Is there any downside to this action???)<br /><br />I will do all I can with my feedback comments to get Intuit Corporation to reverse this ugly strategy, and even through my cost this year is much less (thanks to 2 hours of work with the help desk), I wonder what next year will bring!"
4,One of the best as free trial now I'll see if a paid version is worth it as I monitor and evaluate.
1,"I love the old Word and have used it for years, especially for teaching. All my old quizzes and lesson ideas, plus recipes,  etc have been saved/revamped and used over and over. However..(here it comes) I bought a new laptop this summer and bought the  Home version of Office, too ( computer $ + more $), since new laptops no longer come with Office. I was surprised to learn my old documents, even when transferred, wouldn't open at all unless I also bought the new Home School Office. The files had to be saved to new external hard drive ( computer $ + Word $ + external hard drive $ + $$$$$!) these were then uploaded to the new computer. They were stored in a completely different file which is not a part of the new Word I just bought. I was told the old documents couldn't be added directly to the new ones, so, I now have two Word files-the new one and the old one. I need to leave bread crumbs so I can find what I need! Is the recipe I want in Word A or Word B? Darn! Where is that quiz I typed up? Here, or there?<br />Also, the new Word/Office has way too many choices. Please! Where are the bullets and numbers? I am still looking. do we REALLY need all the pasting options? Please. sometimes simpler is better."
0,"It is no good. It downloads past years from bank constantly lock up. Tried to remove and re-install on clean computer hard drive.<br />Found Freeware that does a better job of downloading from my bank and credit cards.<br />If I could I would get a refund for this product.<br />I recently closed business. Wanted personal software. Have gone back to my Peachtree Complete, does not lockup or screw up my Bank Account.<br />Contacted Intuit customer service on does CHAT, purely a waste of my time. Person could not help, was on chat for 45 minutes.<br />This software is note for me!!!!"
0,"Just like everyone else is saying, they tack on at least $50 worth of fees at the very end.  I had to pay for state e-filing and another type of &#34;filing fee&#34; after all the work of putting in my info.  Very displeased with turbotax and amazon on this one.  Shame on you for misleading everyone with this software.  I will no longer do taxes with intuit software after this go around.  I encourage everyone else to do the same."
0,Would not download
1,intuit did not do a very good job with this release.  I wish I had just stayed my old version.
3,"This anti-virus was installed on my computer when I took it in for repairs at a local computer repair shop.  I'd never heard of it.  I have to say it is the best antivirus software I've used.  i haven't ordered the full version yet.  However, if the free version works so well I'm looking forward to the security the paid version offers."
0,"Started tax return after switching from Intuit.  The updater reports an update is available, however after taking 10 minutes this destroys the installation.  Very poor."
3,I have been a TurboTax customer for 10 to 15 years.  The latest TurboTax Deluxe dropped the C and D schedules and only provided those schedules in the more expensive version.  The H&R Block Deluxe has those forms and at a lower cost.  I have an advanced release so I can't give a real good evaluation.  It does not seem to be as user friendly as TurboTax but I may change my mind as I use it and become more familiar.  My only observation now is I wish the screen print was a bit larger.
1,Won't be buying this again...
0,"This product is a poor representation of previous releases of the software. the bills section lacks common per month displays and edit functions like previous releases. The display of investment accounts showing as the default screen only transactions and having the user to have to hunt for account overview is a complete joke. Who ever designed this \\""update\\"" was obviously a novice programming team. Stay away from this \\""update\\"". It is an amateurish piece of software."
1,I found a huge mistake missed on one of the forms that would have cost me several hundreds of $$$$.
1,I did not see anywhere that this was not a hard disc copy of Turbotax.  I would not have purchased this had I known.
1,"While Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 was less expensive to purchase and download on Amazon, you do not receive the full version with all the files, templates, etc. that you would receive through the hard copy or downloading directly from Adobe.  While you can register your copy with Adobe, it doesn't give you access to many after-purchase files because you do not have an order number from Adobe.  My suggestion is to always buy directly from Adobe."
1,It was okay but not what I expected. It keep interfering with work and popping up. I had to order something else to do the work I wanted and fight viruses.
4,This is great product. This is the only product I use to protect my system. I research and compare pricing before I make a purchase. Since I purchased this item I have enjoyed the use and the price was exceptional.
3,"It's OK.  It seems to pickup all right from what I  was dokng with theQuicken I had before my computer went kaput and I had to replace it, also replacing the Quicken I had had with a new version.  I was happy with the old."
4,The norton 360 6.0 was a very good deal.  It was the same product as buying in the store but less expensive.  Getting the download version I could start using right away.  I recommend.
4,Purchased on line and just got the key # to enter on my new computor were the software was pre loaded and only took 5 min. to install worked great for a fair price form Amazon.
4,"Great Program, had to update after Windows 8.1 Price was really good and I use this almost every day."
2,"I suppose this works for most word processing needs, but in a pickle without my word program, I downloaded this only to discover it's not suited for the editing I exchange with my publisher.  I really can't complain because it was free, and you get what you pay for.  I'm not going to erase it because I'm pretty sure I'll use the spreadsheet option."
4,Very good
1,It took MS support 2 hours remote controlling my computer to get the install done. Final solution seemed to be the only way to uninstall copy of Microsoft Click-to-Run was to boot up in Safe Mode and then the fixit program was successful in uninstalling all old office products. I'm not even sure how click-to-run got on my computer in the first place. I recently installed Windows 8.<br /><br />After removing in Safe Mode rebooted in normal and the installation was successful.
3,"I was very interested in trying Adobe Photoshope.  I have been with Digital Photography for over 11 years.  I already know how to: download photos onto the computer; print; form albums, etc.  With all the many icons Adobe shows (ex; contrast, paint, etc), I thought I'd have more to add to my composition of photos.  I purchased 3 books.  They were too hard to guide me though the steps.  I purchased a DVD for Adobe Photoshop Elements 11 with a tutor who showed step by step but many steps he went through I had to pass.  I just wanted to contrast, add exposure, etc to my photos.  One step was even showing how to remove lines under a man's eyes (like makeup does for a woman).  I thought I'd have more steps for exposure, contrast, etc, but it was too hard to find. They should give quizes for those learning."
2,"Both Microsoft and Delorme don't seem to care much about being the best that they can be, but if you want something portable this is a way to go. I didn't really want to go Microsoft because they are making everything look so ugly these days and almost went with Delorme which never has looked that great, but since I had some old trips that I wanted to refer back to I went with this product. Nothing to brag about.<br /><br />I believe that you used to be able to drag and select an area to zoom in and don't see that any more. Typical - pay more money and lose features."
2,"This was an absolute pain to deal with. I ordered this on Amazon because it was cheaper than from Microsoft itself. I then had to call Microsoft and had them take remote control of my laptop to install the program because I could not install it from the link Amazon sent me! After the day of phone calls and allowing Microsoft to control my computer to install it, I have had no problems using it and recommend the program to anyone that is a college student."
1,"The tax reports are extremely limited. The reports do not allow for margin adjustments and although the reports do not completely cover what is needed, it too 38 pages to cover what 7 pages would cover in the Windows version. Just not workable so have to go back to window version, wasting cost of Mac version."
1,"I purchased the software download and is was very easy to install. the process went well. The problem arose when something started to affect my browsing. I was getting large amounts of popups. I ran the scan twice for several hours but the scan came back clean but I still had problems. I called McAfee and they said I had a bad toolbar but for $70 they would take care of it for me. I thought that taking care of the bad viruses on my computer is why I bought the software in the first place. I hung up and went to youtube and for FREE I was able to take care of it in 5 minutes. Thanks McAfee, great (non)customer support and way to hit me up for more money on a 3-4 minute fix."
3,"Avast is written and the company is primarily located in Prague. (Czech Republic) They treat their dealers like garbage, and undercut dealer pricing schedules, try to take away dealer leads and business among other things but then again Russians do business a bit differently then others. As to the product itself, it's only gotten better and better. They have had some rough spots during new releases and like most Anti Virus programs,  it's nearly useless against Malware! You should run a decent Anti Malware program with it or you will have problems with Malware. I find that MalwareBytes and Avast play well together. Beware that if you buy the product online you will likely have ZERO support when you really need it! A good dealer in North America can really be worth the extra expenditure if they are willing to support the product."
4,Excellent product very user friendly. Would recommend it 100 percent to all who take photography seriously. Looking fwd to Lightroom five and more
1,"It sucks ... definitely not better than 2004 edition ... in fact it's about half as good.  With the 2004 edition it took me a couple days to feel like I knew everything I needed to know and it indeed worked as I thought.  But for the 2011 edition, 6 months later and it's still a pain in the butt ..."
2,"I converted from Pro windows last updated about 2007 so my data would not transfer directly.  However Intuit will take the old data and transfer it ti fit the new format.  I must now relearn the buttons and locations.  It is getting better with time.  You must expect  \\""hiccups\\"" as you change from windows to mac."
4,"It updates often, sometimes daily. It's kept me virus-free for years. Only once did I get a malware infection, but had I been using Anti-Malwarebytes on top of this, I'm sure even that wouldn't have happened. Three thumbs up for Avast!"
2,"When I downloaded this software, all the short cuts appeared on my desk top.  Not just one icon that you could click and open it up to use.  So, now my desk top is super cluttered.  So, it is okay but kind of disappointing."
4,Installed with ease.Right on the game..Brilliant utility.all facits of this program are easy to use and quickly set to suit any requirement.
0,"If I could give this less stars, I would. It was not user friendly in comparison to the &#34;other&#34; software. I bought this as it seemed recommended over the changes to the competitor that resulted in double the price for the same product. At any rate, as I am not an accountant, I really do need a Push Here Dummy approach to doing my taxes...this was NOT it. So disappointed that I cannot return this. I doubt I will be purchasing any software through Amazon again. *sad face*"
4,"I was skeptical.  Due to the cost I figured you get what you pay for, and wow was I WRONG!  I have been working with hitfilm for about six months for editing music videos, short films, vlogs, and various corporate web content.  I am still trying to push it further with special effects.....and I am not coming close to it's limits.  All I can say is Rock on.  Well worth the money."
4,"I have been using Turbo Tax for many years.  The current version is, as expected, a very superior product and it just keeps getting better."
3,"This software has an easy-to-use interface.  It does give me some issues when I'm attempting to click on a transaction line by having a information popup get in the way, but I can live with that."
1,"I own 2 macs and 1 pc (don't ask why- I regret it now), and realize that I miss the simplicity and power of iPages.  It is a far superior product to this one, but from what I've read, so are some of the others (open office, etc).<br /><br />I've had difficult navigating the menus and finding some of what I consider to be simple things.  Menus are cluttered and poorly laid out.  I really regret purchasing this.<br /><br />The software itself, from time to time, is a little buggy, so that plus the complex navigation and it's unfriendliness to new users earns it two stars... at best."
3,Good application<br />Cons: No help file. All help is online from 3rd party videos and forums.
1,Not really any improvements over my old edition. My street is still not on it and it was added 10 years ago. The software works well for planning a trip but I'm sorry that I bothered to update. Feel like I wasted my money.
4,"Bery Good as always, and with the new App for iPhone and iPad it's great for use. Very Good software"
3,I say the best because I have been using it for many years and the fact that it knows all your data from last year saves a lot of work.
4,great price
2,"Had issues with the download, then accessing it with code. I finally asked for a refund. Before receiving refund I tried one last download and it worked. Saw many reviews of others having same problem. It's been almost a year since I bought this but I clearly remember it ( and recorded my frustrations in my tax file) and I'm hoping I won't have the same issues this year."
2,"Norton Security single device license version of the latest incarnation of what was Norton Internet Security. Norton has revamped their retail security lineup with the home line simplified to pretty much Norton Security with or without backup.<br /><br />This has licensing for just ONE device: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) or Android. If you ONLY have one device this is fine, but if you have even two you are much better getting the 5 device version of [[ASIN:B00MHZ6Z64 Norton Security]] or 10 device [[ASIN:B00MHZ71G2 Norton Security with Backup]] which should be enough for many families.<br /><br />In either 1, 5 or 10 device licenses you do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.<br /><br />Windows Setup:<br /><br />Windows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is missing in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to white-list specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me, but more on that near the end.<br /><br />In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is less \\""noisy\\"" than previous versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I didn't perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.<br /><br />Application Compatibility Problems:<br /><br />I use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox would not start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products (including [[ASIN:B00JKZPTPC Norton Small Business]]). I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release (as of Oct. 1, 2014). It was good I found a solution because this virtual machine is critical to my business. This was the only application compatibility problem I've come across so far.<br /><br />Since then I found the settings for exclusions. It isn't on the security page reached via the advanced button as one might expect, but found from the small gear icon for settings at the top of the control panel. The exclusions are buried in this group of settings pages. Go to settings, antivirus, scans tab, to Exclusions/Low Risks and then finally items to exclude.<br /><br />If you want an integrated on-line backup solution, you might want to consider getting [[ASIN:B00MHZ71G2 Norton Security with Backup]] that supports 10 devices and includes 25GB of online backup space. Windows 7 Pro has a very capable backup program that works well with USB or network drives as backup media. For the difference in price it might be well spent if you need online backup and/or more than 5 devices.<br /><br />Mobile Support:<br /><br />The IOS app is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:<br />1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4 a mile way from its actual location!!<br />2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number<br />3) it has a \\""scream\\"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise<br /><br />If the \\""scream\\"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS support is pretty lame. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I don't have an android device to try this out.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br /><br />This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other antivirus solutions on this computer did not, and does not seem to slow things down. I had one application that had a problem, but nothing else. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but does not include some advanced controls like white listing of applications, files or folders. It is probably a good tradeoff for most home users.<br /><br />The ONE device license is not a bargain. The software itself is a great product for most people. I had an application problem and the IOS app is poor. Because of the relatively minor issues and the poor value compared to the 5 device Norton Security or 10 device Norton Security with Backup I'm giving Norton Security for 1 device 3 stars.slow things down.

2,Really to early to say how I like it. Anything to do with Windows 8.1 has a hard time being appreciated because the Windows 8.1 platform is so terrible. I guess until I have a problem with it I would only be able to say it is ok.
0,"Very buggy.  I had to rollback to previous version.  I'll try installing again in 60 days when, I hope, the bugs will be fixed.  Otherwise, as a longtime Quicken user, highly recommended."
0,"I wish I could give this 0 stars.... Bottom line: If you are switching from a windows version, you will be EXTREMELY Disappointed!<br /><br />Pros: Clean look<br />Cons: lacks functionality and views from the Windows versions<br />Budgets: only 1 view, only for one month<br />Bills: limited reviews<br />Reports: almost there but not good enough<br /><br />I bought a MAC and am loving it, but Quicken for MAC is made for very basic users.  I couldn't be more disappointed.  I've been using Quicken for windows since the late 90s and I would classify myself as an average user.  I like to download my transactions and check my budget.  I have a yearly budget and my wife and I could both access it to plan out purchases, vacations, etc.  The budget function is very limited.  You can choose categories but you can't see a yearly view.  I think the only way to view a long term budget would be to run reports and download into a spreadsheet.  But thats why you have these programs to simplify the process."
0,"could not get the program completely down load,did not work, tried every thing just did not work, complicated got tired of trying."
4,"works fine.  i don't realize that apple &#34;pages'  can be saved as a word document.  but i am glad i got this product,  since i am more familiar with &#34;word&#34; and the other programs"
2,This program is good if you are just starting out or just nee to do some book keeping. I handle accounting and inventory for 2 separate companies on has this program and the other has 2011 Peachtree complete accounting. If you are going to do a bunch on invoicing and has a decent customer base and inventory I would recommend the complete as it offers many more custom reports and makes tracking easier.
2,Can't tell the difference between 2013 and 2014.  Bought it just to make sure I could still download transaction from financial institutions.
1,"Very difficult to install on second computer, totally gave up on the third.  Not a fan."
2,"It does the job. I was pretty much forced to upgrade from 2013 as it said online services would quit working and I use it to accept credit cards. Functionally, 2015 is okay and has a few improvements, but it's a resource hog compared to 2013, and some of the windows won't size down and are a pain on a small monitor with 1024x768 resolution."
1,"The price went up.  The State forms were not included and I had to pay extra for them.  The software no longer handled investment income, without another download that cost money.  I really loved the software until this year.  Now, I am not so sure this is the best value.  I will check other options for next year."
1,Doesn't seem to do much more than Microsoft Word. Maybe I just don't know how to use this to it's full capabilities.
0,"and absolutely regret transitioning from 2012. Two people in my office; one remote, not to count the multiple calls to QB tech support ... who refuse to talk to you unless you pay to talk and then try to upsell you for a 90-day contract. What kind of garbage and rotten customer service is that?<br /><br />We have had nothing but freeze ups on our computer since its installation and doesn't save. It's a QB issue.  Why did we switch? ... because our bookkeeper said we had to upgrade from 2012 because of banking download requirements. Good enough. I bought Pro. We kept thinking it must be us. It's not--this program is a lemon. Don't buy it. As a QB user for over 20 years, I'm shocked at the lack of service and the inability to talk to someone in the U.S. when we asked tech support for it. I don't want someone who is working with a script; nor someone who can't make a decision or even say, something might be wrong. Shocking."
1,"I wish I had listened to the negative reviews. I suggest anyone considering this not buy this at Amazon, go somewhere you can get a trial version to see if you can make it work.<br />It started with how slow the download was, I had to leave my laptop open all night as it took over six hours to download.<br /><br />The problem is that this software is way too complicated for anyone but a junkie who likes to spend hours figuring something out or a software engineer. There are 3-4 ways to do everything, and all of them are complicated. You can imagine the number of menu items involved, Which makes finding things difficult sorting through all the noise.<br /><br />I spent hours just reading help files and watching videos just to figure out how to scroll the map side to side or to zoom, and even after using it for a while I was still making mistakes and getting lost.<br /><br />On MS streets and trips I don't think I ever had to read a help file, just check the menus and you can figure it out. Not with this software. Too bad MS won't support S&T any more, there is no good software for someone who wants more than your bing/google low feature freebies but doesn't want to go to computer grad school."
1,The product worked just fine.  It was the fine print (Small type) that stated that there would be  a surcharge for &#34;E&#34; filing the state return.<br /><br />The title of the product made it seem that it came with that feature and I was surprised that it asked me to pay more money as I was getting ready to &#34;E&#34; file my state return.<br /><br />I think this is a very shady thing to do.  I've been using Intuit products almost since they day they came out and have always felt they were a good value.  This incident is making me re-evaluate that feeling.  To put it candidly it's what I expect from Scammers not companies that have earned the public trust.<br /><br />&#34;Caveat emptor&#34;.
2,"I purchased HomeDesigner Pro 7.0, and then upgraded to version 8.0. The software is pretty good, especially for a one level floor plan. It gets pretty iffy, for multi level plans. The videos are helpful, but I keep looking at Barnes and Noble, for a book that would explain how to use some of the really great features of this product.  What really bothers me, is that when I now start the program, I get this popup window that informs me that an \\""update\\"" is available. Normally, when I see that an update is available, it is a no cost update to the current version. But...no, this update is for a $200.00 upgrade to the next version. THIS IS NOT AN UPDATE!!! And it's pretty annoying to have to click the NO button, just to start the software that I've already paid for.   Functionally, the libraries don't really include uptodate materials, and eventhough this is supposed to be a Chef Architect product, it's really turning out to be a poorly supported product.  And then there's this UBS device, used to make sure that the software is being run legally. Well, if you can tell that I don't have the latest version of your software, why do I need to have the stupid USB device taking up one of my ports?  So, I have to say that the product is not really bad, and can be pretty useful, but this whole issue of making sure that the software is being run legally, and the annoying \\""Update\\"" messages makes me sometimes regret that I've spent the money. It's beginning to look like a money pit."
2,"This is pretty much just a note to say that downloading this product is the way to go if you have any chance of parting with the box. I had my hard disk replaced on my Mac, which rendered my old copy of Office unusable. I have the box, but it is in storage in deepest Brooklyn, and I am currently in New Jersey. I was forced with the choice of traveling a couple hours to Brooklyn and another hour or so rummaging through 100 boxes to find the original box with the product code, or buying and downloading a new copy. At least I did upgrade to the 2011 version from the 2008 version, but I haven't noticed anything I didn't have before that seems vital. Now at least I've got the product code stored on the computer. Should have copied it over when I got the original, if only I'd had a clue."
3,I saved about 5 bux by using the download version.  Works as advertised.  Can't go wrong and save some money.
2,"The product works as advertised, but it wasn't clear which version I should get ( Intuit moved some forms to the premier version...that's the reason for the 3 starts), fortunately I didn't sell any stocks...so Deluxe was fine for me.<br />PS<br />I'm a longtime TurboTax user, and back then it was great because I didn't have to worry about which forms to get (who doesn't sell stocks?)."
4,Good product and easy to install
3,I've used rental property managemr before and wanted to upgrade so I could utilize my lap top while on the job site. Love how easy to inter and pass the info to my main computer.
1,"Ordered it to replace existing Norton product. Don't feel the instructions as to how to replace existing Norton products were adequate or clear. I have had to go to the help desk severl times,  I wound up going removing the existing product through a online Norton removal tool and have still experienced problems in getting it installed and working on one of the two computers where I installed it,  I wound up purchasing McAfee  for one of the computers and got the product installed without problems. I will not be returning to Norton unless significant changes are made in the product"
4,Thank you
3,"Hey it's Quicken!  Great for home, personal, or small business usage but you have to use it to learn to use it effectively.  Msitakse easily made and mistakes easily corrected."
1,"I upgraded from Quicken Premier 2009 only because of their forced upgrade policy. It seems basically the same with a new look, which is annoying because now I have to discover where things are. For instance, Reconcile is now harder to find and use. Kinda like Microsoft Office Ribbon; doesn't have any new functionality or ease of use and just a lot harder to find stuff.<br /><br />EDIT: after using this for a few weeks, I'm removing one more star for this \\""upgrade\\"". They're fooling only the very naive with that term. I've found significant bugs that didn't exist in my prior version; for instance, it appears to download my Wells Fargo accounts, giving them a green check mark, but in fact no data is updated! I have to log in to my accounts in a browser and download the Web Connect format file; then it works. How can this company break something so basic to their product?<br /><br />I wish they would just charge $20/year for bug fixes and modest (genuine) improvements, instead of claiming it's significantly better.  I only \\""upgrade\\"" every three years when required, because there's nothing in this version that's any better than 2009."
3,I switched to Quickbooks online and billing my customers is easier then ever. I love how I can access my info with my mobile phone or anywhere I have internet. Price is affordable also.
3,Solid and easy product
4,I have used turbo tax for several years.  It is easy to follow and I have had no problems with it.
0,"I'm one of the victims of the schedule D changes. They say they are offering $25, but the program wants to charge me $30 to \\""upgrade.\\"" I tried calling the 800 number that they have been posting. Waited on hold for a half hour before having to go and resume my life. I've never used the Block software but going to send the email and see what happens. Might as well test drive it. Worst case I can always end up \\""upgrading\\"" my Turbotax if I don't like.    Otherwise the same as past years, but a little more sluggish (and this on a new windows 8 machine that is plenty fast on non-Intuit software). It takes multiple steps to get past the marketing and handholding, but I know some like that. And it asks you the same questions over and over again even after you've said no once. Not sure what is up with Intuit. Quicken is becoming ungodly slow and bloated and now this. I'm disappointed."
4,"Very easy to use, worth the money for easy legal advice"
2,"I'm happy w/ it, but I'll keep my 1 Terabyte One Drive service for free"
2,mcfee tp works well good online price
2,It no longer contain the information for rental property
2,"The product seems to be working fine now, but the download was not as seamless as most other software I download.  Turbotax is smart enough to recognize whether I already have the prior copy of the software. Norton made me redo everything.<br />I almost got the impression that they were artificially making the download process more difficult because the Amazon price was significantly below their MSRP.<br /><br />p.s. When I was buying the software from Amazon, nowhere did it say \\""old version\\"". Now that I've bought it, Amazon seems to have inserted that into the review description."
1,Only works with scanner on TWAIN drivers
1,"Have used several versions, this is about the most basic program that you can utilize.  This program basically provides a template layout that you are required to complete essentially every legalese verbiage not much 'canned code' included..."
2,My Quicken 2011 was working perfectly fine until I had to buy this new program.  We also have had to purchase new checks in the past and the wheel keeps on turning.  There is an error that occured that is not allowing me to properly backup my information and I hope to have that resolved soon.  In the big picture the program is good but if there were something new out that was consumer friendly I would take a hard look.  I don't know what happened with IOS users in the past but it seems that there was some kind of game going on where there was no support or the program was the absolute bear essentials for the Mac operating system.  It would have been nice to trust that people could have worked together to produce a better version for that.
2,I down loaded the product but there was no instruction manual so I had to feel my way through it making many mistakes along the way.
0,"Having recently purchased a MacBook Pro, I was hoping to break the chains for all things PC. Having used Quicken since the 2003 version, I was hopeful Quicken for Mac would make my transition easier. Not so!<br /><br />While I don't use Quicken for bank reconciliation, tracking investments or any of the other online services, I was extremely disappointed to find out that this version of Quicken is even incapable of making a simple register and or category report. After all, a simple register report is basic to every Quicken for PC I have ever used, through the 2011 version.<br /><br />My solution was simple, throw Quicken for Mac into the trash, install Parallels and a fresh install of windows 7 on a virtual machine.  Once I installed my quicken 2011 onto the windows 7 virtual machine, I had the best of both worlds... Good old Quicken and the grace and speed of a Mac.<br /><br />I would not recommend Quicken for Mac, at least not until they put some serious effort into improving it!"
1,"Download went just fine. Installed and started program. &#34;Unexpected Error...&#34; pop up.  Tried to update. Same popup.  Researched online at TT and web.  Fix is a manual download to update.  Update installed apparently OK.  Still no online update. Same popup.  Ran program and finished fed return.  Download State.  No way. No solution.  Gotta get it done this weekend.  Went to W*****t and spent another $90 to get Home and Business ON DISC.  Installed, updated downloaded State.  Worked perfectly.  Do not buy the download.  Buy the disc."
0,"After years of working on older versions of Quicken, my husband convinced me to upgrade to Quicken 2015. It is the worst software upgrade EVER! It doesn't reconcile, it doesn't void checks, it doesn't stand up to any of the features of the older versions! I wish I could go back to the older versions!"
4,Good deal
1,"1. This product is too expensive - $49 for a one-time use simply isn't worth it for what you get.<br />2. This product doesn't work as well as advertised - some of the applications that were transferred to the new PC simply do not work - registry values were fouled up, popups about missing dll files were experienced, etc.  I was hoping to avoid this.<br />3. I will not use PCmover again - not ever."
3,"Overall, this product is a good way to do your federal and state taxes. Occasionally, something was confusing, so it was handy to have a copy of last year's taxes on hand since they had been done professionally. If you want to review something you've already done, you have to go through several pagess to get to that part. There were 107 pages of filled in forms, summaries, and calculated worksheets at the end. Some of that could have been consolidated--such as an individual page for each charity I gave to."
4,"Great for the price.  Customer service is below par, but that was expected.  NOTE:  File your federal taxes FIRST, before trying to download the state update.  It will not work and you will be on hold for 45 mins so don't waste your time.  The state update will work once you file your federal taxes.  Also, know that to e-file your state taxes, it will cost an additional $19.95.  Next time I will file my state taxes myself, not worth the extra 19.95, in my opinion.  Great software though!  Would recommend to others."
3,I hate that it makes you pay separately for state efile.  Otherwise did a great job.  First time I used H&R after years of using another brand that raised their prices outrageously.
3,"While it's by no means perfect, it runs and operates far better than it's PC counterpart. Unless you absolutely must have bill pay, there is no better personal financial management program for Mac.    The PC version has become clunky, bloated and glitchy. Quicken 2015 for Mac is just the opposite. It's interface is clean, the transaction download is far quicker than the PC version and reporting is lightyears ahead. Editing and reviewing multiple transactions is a breeze, and transaction matching is a simple drag and drop method.    For investments, it does only offer basic transaction and cost basis tracking. The 2015 PC version offers a fantastic portfolio X-Ray tool that I would like to see in the Mac version, but not a deal breaker. The investment tools will be good enough for most people with IRAs and 401s, as well as casual stock traders.    Overall, I am glad they did not port over the PC code. Taking the Essentials base and adding the most requested features as absolutely the right direction. I don't think anyone claimed Essentials did not work well, because it worked very well, it was just too basic. Quicken 2015 added enough tools for too keep intermediate level Quicken users happy.    Definetly buy it here for $50! Intuit and Mac App Store prices are $75."
1,"So far, so good!"
1,I have never been impressed with Norton so I don't know why I thought this version would be any different.  Slows up the computer and causes many crashes.  It even let a virus get through.  This computer is only a couple months old and should not be slow or crashing.  Uninstalled Norton and got another brand... no further problems with slowness or crashes.
4,Once I figured it out I had no problem!
1,I found TurboTax to be intentionally misleading when it comes to &#34;State&#34;. They allow you to fill in your information but charge upwards of $20 to submit for you. Pretty shady. Not sure if I would buy them again.
3,"No issues with download; 7 min or so over fast cable modem, no issues on install.  Turbotax is what it is; high price but fairly fast and easy to use.    Note: I noticed that if you buy the cheaper \\""federal only\\"" then later add a state you pay more than deluxe which includes a state.  Nasty Intuit marketing practice.    But hey; its good; Amazon download saves money, thanks Amazon."
4,I am happy with the service Avast provides.  I  think  the updates are a very important feature. Good work everyone.
0,"Been using Quickbooks WIndows for about 5 years. Recently had office computer hard drive failure and decided to switch to Mac. First, the pros: ...<br /><br />Next, the negeatives: AWFUL! Interface is clunky. Often have to click out of the window and then come back in. General odd behavior when navigating. These wouldn't be so bad in order to have MAC stability, virus protection and time capsule back-up, but the following are serious flaws in design. Especially considering Windows version can do these without problem.<br /><br />1- No way to allocate items to specific clients when writing purchase orders. Quickbooks tech says you have to add client info only when enteriing the bill. How in the world can I remember which items are for which client 2 months later when receiving the items and creating the bill? Insane!! Some PO's arent received till months later and may have dozens of items for multiple clients. I guess I could break apart every order, create dozens of extra PO's for the same vendor and list the client name in the memo bar. Thanks for the extra work Intuit!<br /><br />2- No ability to add new items when writing purchase orders. You have to leave the PO screen and open the items list, create a new item and then go back into PO and look for it. Makes no sense that the item drop down wouldnt have \\""add new\\"" at the top of the list.<br /><br />3- Every time you open the item list and create a new item, the item box opens to \\""service item\\"" by default instead of inventory item. No way to default this or have it remember last used. Not a real problem, but annoying. My momma always said, its the little things!<br /><br />4- The entire enter bill, pay bill, write check is clunky. Why cant I just pay the bill and print the check right there in the same transaction? Just annoying...<br /><br />5- Tech support is AWWWWWWWWWFFFFFUUUUUULLLLLL!!!!!!! I have never asked to speak to another rep while in a tech support call, especially after waiting on hold for 48 minutes, but I couldnt understand anything the tech said due to the accent. Also, please dont just read the script to me without actually hearing the problem.<br /><br />I am 3 days into Quickbooks for MAC and I am seriously considering buying Parallels and re-loading the Windows version on the Mac computer. Very expensive lesson learned. I just dont understand how in the world anyone at Intuit could have created this after using the Windows version first. If they never touched the Windows version before creating this, then shame on them for dropping the ball and missing a critical first step.<br /><br />I can only imagine the remaining items I will find that don't work over the next few weeks as I really get into the MAC version...Templates? Sale Tax liability? Employee payroll? I dont even want to think about it!<br /><br />JUST ADDED!!<br /><br />6- \\""Receive item and enter bill\\"" option doesnt work. Every time I select \\""Receive and enter bill\\"" option, I get an error that says \\""warning - pending item receipts exist for this vendor\\"". After OK, I get a blank screen for the vendor with 0.00. Only way to get the open purchase order screen to pop up is to select \\""receive items\\"" and then I have to remember to select \\""enter bill\\"" check box. Why have the \\""receive and enter bill\\"" option on there at all if it doesnt work? Annoying...Always worked in WIndows..."
3,"Is somewhat complicated for anything but bank statements and checks, but the reports are good and easy to set up.<br /><br />Support is EXPENSIVE...this is where Quickbooks and Intuit make their money!"
0,"This product from 2013 was being advertised with the 2014 version.  I accidentally purchased the 2013 version.  Because you have a no return policy for software, I was stuck with last years product.  I was and still am unhappy about this."
2,it's okay.
3,easy to use and and accurate for the feds
4,"Been using Quicken since 2010 when Microsoft discontinued Money. Smooth transition. Very pleased with performance which gets better with each upgrade. Does everything I want a money manager tool to do, including exporting files for spreadsheet, database use. I use Quicken several times per week.  Highly recommend it."
4,I am using N360 for about 4 years now on 3 windows laptops/tablet and I am very happy.<br />No fault alerts and no work disruptions.
3,"Straight forward software which I downloaded from the Amazon digital center.  The product produces a lot of legal documents including an advance directive.  It would be nice if it produced a POLST form, but it does not."
3,"Found a coupon that would have saved me $10 AFTER, I downloaded.  It worked well, taxes are done and submitted - Federal is no cost electronic filing, State filing cost additional $$"
3,After all these years its good to see some things haven't changed. I can download and file federal taxes for myself and my business with ease. Downloading the state program was great. Thank You for a very good product. Makes filing taxes almost a pleasure.
1,"At the end of the program when it does its error scan, it kept telling me there was an error I needed to correct but it would not let me correct it.  It had something to do with Obama care and you can't be over 65 and on Obama care.  Could not finish my taxes."
4,"I do taxes for me and my relatives and this product does an excellent job in preparation, electronic filing and offering help where needed.  When filing electronically you often get acceptance from their center and IRS on the same day.  I think their competition is Turbo Tax - (I have used in past) is their major competition.  Turbo Tax offers help in more detail (which I do not have to use) however, the extra price is not worth the purchase.  I intend to stay with H and R because it does a great job at a reasonable price."
2,"This works about as well as Word worked back in the Windows 95 era.  Although it saves your data regularly, it sometimes crashes during autosaves and you end up losing a lot of your work. This is great if you're using it once in a while and don't have the money to shell out for the real deal, but if you're relying on it to come through for you while doing serious school or job related projects, you will be sorely disappointed. I gave it 3 stars because I like the price.  But it's definitely not on par with MS Word."
0,"I'm big when on reading reviews before I purchase anything.  This was a tricky one because there are a lot of bad reviews and a lot of good reviews.  What I noticed, however, is that most of the bad reviews were right around Oct. 2012 and most of the good reviews were around Jan. 2013.  Seems to me that they must of gotten all the bugs out by Jan.  The download version costs $29 and the CD version costs $69.  I downloaded it and made an extra copy as a backup since I didn't get a CD.<br /><br />I am very impressed with Quicken 2013 and I think it's the best version ever made.  I purchased it so I could sync my data with the Android app.  No more collecting receipts and entering them when I get home.  No more using a separate budget program on my Android.  I can purchase something at a store or restaurant and enter the receipt immediately.  It even uses my phone's gps to detect where I am and make suggestions of where the purchase was done.  I like that I can view my budget anywhere as well.  The new budget also uses rollover which I like very much.  So, like if I budget $10 for office supplies, but don't spend $10 this month, I have $20 to spend next month.<br /><br />My only drawback is while using the app on my phone, I must have a data connection to enter transactions.  If I have no WiFi or cellular service, it will not let me enter transactions offline.<br /><br />(update 8/9/13)<br />It used to work great.  The Android app stopped syncing with my bank.  Quicken did nothing to help me out with it.  I'm no longer a customer of Quicken anymore after 20 years or so.  I used EEBA now."
2,OK for the free part but I believe the sale tactics of (you need so much of these and that...) I am almost buying the year service but not sold on the needs. I have McAfee and no mention of those needs. Maybe later after finish Windows 10.
0,I have used quicken for over 20 years on the pc and it is great. This Mac version does not work as well. The reports are lacking so is not useful at all for my purpose. I wish I could return it.
3,"I'm still in the process of preparing my tax returns - so far, so good! TT is easy to use and relatively supportive. I ran into some difficulty with the foreign tax credit but in the end was able to figure out how to get it to work. In this case, TT's help facility wasn't of much use. If your return is above a certain level of complexity, you have to be prepared to root around a bit and explore some possibilities."
0,Totally worthless. Been using Quicken since its initial release. Each new release includes useless new features while the online payment and updating engine is totally broken and has not been modified in over 25 years.
1,"I gave it two stars cause it sounded so cool.  When I got it I found out it had &#34;limited&#34;  sounds available for trial version.  Meaning almost nilThe sounds that did come on it were a bewilderment to me.  It said guitar, drums ect...  But they didn't sound like any instruments I'd ever played or heard.  Terrible sounding loops.  Not even close to the demo's on their sight.  I have a great sound system and recoding studio at my place.  That's about all I can say.  Lousy loops.  Nothing else matters."
1,"Of course, I was looking for something simple to use, like SnagIt, but it works so I guess I'll get by. I just don't need all the features it has and instructions are very skimpy."
2,"Having used it many years now, the interface is familiar and relatively easy to use, though navigation feels arcane and data transparency needs improvement.  But it has failed to catch mistakes that it should have caught.  TurboTax remains an uninspired, not quite reliable tool that could use a fresh take on the User Interface and more intelligence behind the scenes."
0,"The software is hard to use and doesn't track loans automatically. Also, if you do buy, get it off the shelf from a reputable place. I bought this as an electronic download and tried to return it and it seems I'm out my $75. I followed the instructions to return it and they simply ignore my emails or tell me to be patient (more then 45 days).    I won't ever buy anything from this company again."
0,"I have used Turbo Tax forever. After ordering the download for 2014 through Amazon, I will never purchase again.<br />I am unsure if this is a Turbo Tax or an Amazon issue, but in order to install 2014, I had to delete 2013 which meant no information was carried over. I was also unable to manually override any figures.<br />I do have to say that the Amazon tech person that talked me through the issue was helpful and knowledgable."
4,Fast. total security. everything you will ever need! I will buy again this is my second time. and I will continue to but this very product from this very site!
1,Product worked great except where NYC resident taxes needed to be filled in. The form made no sense and there was no help anywhere to fill it out properly. Even brought it into a physical HR BLock and they recommended Turbo Tax for this section Ha. Ended up being audited because I initially filled it out wrong. I'd stick to Turbo Tax if you are a NYC resident.
1,"Even though I indicated that I was a first time homebuyer in the \\""Life Changes\\"" section, Turbo Tax recommended that I take the standard deduction and did NOT point out that I would be eligible for a $7,500 tax credit if I itemized. OMG! Glad I read my village newsletter! Then, yes, it did want to charge me $19.95 extra to FILE to the state return of $55.00.  No thanks, I'll drop it in the mail later for 42 cents."
1,"Every year I buy TurboTax Deluxe and a free state download is included. Not this time! They wanted an additional $40 for the state download. I guess I should have read the fine print, but I trusted TurboTax. Not any more."
4,"Outstanding product - simple to use and covers all tax issues that you may have, gets you the biggest refund."
2,"I feel like I was tricked into buying this version, when I really thought I was getting the one with one State Tax included.<br />Not happy at all!!!"
2,"This sure seems to be only an incremental upgrade, nothing earth shattering or mind boggling.  The biggest reason I upgraded (from 2012) was the bank forced me to (they would not allow online updates any more).<br />Otherwise, a decent upgrade.  But who really needs to access this data \\""on the go\\""?"
4,I have been using it for years and it is the best. Much less background running that McAfee & Norton. Very user friendly.
1,"I have been using Turbo Tax for many years, but this year's version was bad.  My major complaint is that I could not print the final version from a different computer as I placed the final version on a zip drive and hoped when I got to the office I could print it.  When I called your help desk I got a automated voice that did not answer my question.<br /><br />Then as per instructions, I emailed the IRS for a hard copy and so far have not received one.  This was a little over a month ago."
1,"I've had this software that I downloaded from Amazon, for a number of months.  When it works, it is great, and captures your screencasts.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work most of the time, and it crashes in the middle of recording and you get an error message and the entire recording disappears.  That means that you waste a lot of your time doing a recording only to have it stop and be worthless.  I am sorry I purchased this software, and would advise looking for a more reliable screen capture program."
1,It was na elephant but not a pleasnat one. Took up too much space and served very little purpose. Oh well
4,This is the tax software that I have used for 20 yrs. It never fails me - very easy to use; provides me with the right forms for mailing. Price is reasonable and data is privately kept on my own pc - not somewhere that is supposed to be secure on the internet.
2,"Quicken is like a bad customer service phone call: its aggravating, its what I use because I need to, I don't have to like it, but it gets the job done. I tried to give it 2 stars \\""I don't like it\\"" but I could not honestly say that. For instance, like calling a customer support line, when I negotiate the (new and improved) phone tree, and then a company eventually gives me a refund or provides the warranty service promised (even after a long wait on the phone), have I prevailed? Yes. Am I frustrated and even a little outraged? Yes. But its okay and I will get over it.<br /><br />Okay, enough with the analogy already. As most others have stated, Quicken \\""has to be updated\\"" every 2 or 3 years. What drives this? The banks? Some sort of protocol dictated by the FDIC or the Federal reserve? I sure doubt it -- Intuit (Quicken's manufacturer) does not blame it on anyone, so it must be their policy. No matter, online access (at least the automated online access provided by Quicken) will be UNAVAILABLE using software you purchased as recently as last month. (Yes people do buy Quicken 2010 in early 2013, its available at a bargain rate! It has not happened to me, but I am sure there are those out there who pay their $9.99 for Quicken 2010 with NO IDEA that online banking will not be available past April 2013!)<br /><br />Like Microsoft's Windows, they know they have a large segment of the market share. They can make their software better, and change the features, and make the previous version obsolete. It doesn't matter to THEM that you -- the end user, the customer -- are used to the old features and don't want to learn new ways of accomplishing the routine tasks the software does for you. (Imagine THAT! a company that gave you a choice to upgrade or not! oh, nevermind you don't have to imagine it.... almost EVERY OTHER MAJOR software program gives you that option.)<br /><br />You can tell I am still ticked off: oh sure, I had a moment of common sense and bought it online from a third-party instead of taking advantage of Intuit's \\""SALE\\"" price of  $20 off that is advertised repeatedly, almost every time the program starts. Yeah, its something like $69 instead of $89 from Intuit. An online retailer sent it to me, tax and shipping and everything for under $50. So I guess maybe I saved a few bucks from Intuit's targeted victims / captive audience / unsuspecting consumers.<br /><br />But seriously, that planned obsolescence ought to be against the law.<br /><br />Deserving some real reporting at the end of the news story, it does an adequate job of budgeting, charts & graphs, and reports. I have not bothered to learn the \\""new\\"" approach to how these features work THIS TIME but I have in the past and the growing pains are not terrible. Customization of reports -- sorry, based on Quicken 2010, which was only slightly different from the previous 2 versions I used-- could be improved.  (I am talking about formatting how the reported is displayed on the screen and/or printed on the page). But other than that, the workhorse engine (for how I use the software) is reliable and powerful. And that is what I will describe next.<br /><br />First: the checkbook or account register is intuitive, and relatively easy to use. (Like I said before, the buttons are not in the same places as Quicken 2010! ARGH, years getting used to a software program only to have it \\""improved\\"" for me).  It includes features like memorized payees, finding transactions in account histories, recurring transactions and reminders, suggested automation for frequently used payees or deposits, and the ability to make an entry name whatever you want it to be, based on what your bank called it.<br /><br />Second: investments. Quicken tracks transactions you make in stocks and bonds as long as you can get online with your broker to download the info. So your 401k, IRA, or simple investments fund is going to work well here. Quicken can identify new securities (stocks) and suggest making them new or associating them with a previously used ticker. (Why in the world a mutual fund with a different ticker would possibly be the same as a different mutual fund with a different name and a different ticker, I will never know, but Quicken would allow you to do that if its what you want). Transactions are recorded in much the same way that they are online. If you are a sophisticated trader, you are probably using some better software.<br /><br />Third (and last for me, I have wasted enough time on this review): the calender and predicting what is ahead, budgeting, reports/charts/graphs, password protection, and online access. I lump all this together because its functionality that is either built-in and used all the time, or something you take for granted and only use once in a while. It makes the whole thing work together and you can see where your money comes from and where it went. Categories and tax-related transactions are good. Tagging is a new concept and I am not sure what I would use it for (its different than categories). Account management is good and the ability to see or hide accounts comes in handy. Net worth calculation is kind of neat and the ability to change what is seen on your Quicken \\""home page\\"" is nice (this feature was already present in 2010). One-step update is VERY useful and probably the single solitary reason I am still using Quicken. As soon as someone else gets this right (who knows, maybe there is already another program out there that does) I will probably switch to them.<br /><br />Tax-related expenditures, tracking and predicting income taxes, and so on, is a feature that I do not use personally, but it looks like it works fine and it would probably come in handy if you are \\""OCD\\"" enough to stay on top of it. If you set up the tax-related features and use them faithfully, then April 15th would hold no fear for you (or your accountant would be impressed) I suppose.<br /><br />Overall: its worth it I guess. I will get over the \\""monopoly-like\\"" hold that Intuit has on the automatic banking download features of money management software. Heh, just writing this review has helped. A little.em new or associating them with a previously used ticker.

0,"Very buggy and I'm not at any skill level to correct it on my own. In my opinion, it shouldn't need fixing.  These were basic set up tasks that weren't working properly. In split items on the check register, items would be inputted then jump out (both descriptions and $ amounts) and with no consistency. I couldn't correct it. I would close out and come back in to restart fresh. It kept happening. I called Intuit Help 24/t that I'm actually paying for! My first call - it took 45 minutes & 46 seconds for a live person to answer with those scripted answers. The \\""Help\\"" kept putting me on hold to ask someone else for help. He finally dsconnected himself from my questions after 1 hour and 13 minutes total. He did not call back although he had the phone number. It's 3 hours later and Intuit hasnt even sent me an email to find out how favorable my experience was with them.  I suspect there are some BIG problems we'll be hearing more about. In fact, I came to this site googling to see if others were having difficulties. I have Windows 7."

4,"I have been using Quicken at least since 2003. Some times, it is hard to appreciate what the new features are and are not obvious unless you have a need for it and then you research it.<br /><br />There should be an upgrade available for the lower price so that the existing customers don't pay the regular price - same as a new customer!<br /><br />There should be some features that allow one to request new features in future releases."
2,"This software is the same quality software we all expect from Microsoft and I am certain you'll be pleased with it (more on that later)---but first, be very careful about what you're buying, because there is no longer an upgrade path between Office 2010 versions:<br /><br />I purchased this product for my brother, who did not need Outlook.  Once installed, however, I realized that the software labels itself \\""Not for commercial use\\""--meaning, it's not licensed for use in a business, and this was going to be for use in an office.  This was clearly my fault:  I was only looking at the included products, and not thinking about the license terms.<br /><br />No matter; I figured I would simply upgrade him to \\""Home and Business\\""--only to find that Microsoft's latest upgrade strategy is...well, there isn't one.  According to Microsoft, this keeps things simpler for consumers, because apparently we were having trouble understanding the difference between \\""upgrade\\"" and \\""full\\"" versions.  So to upgrade, you just have to buy the higher-level version at full price.  For this reason, I feel Microsoft should do a little more \\""are you sure?\\"" work during installation (for example, \\""Is this software going to be used in a business environment?\\"" would have been a great question in my case...)<br /><br />So if you're purchasing this for a business, OR you think you will need Outlook, Access or Publisher eventually, strongly consider buying either the Home and Business version (adds Outlook and business licensing) or Professional version (additionally adds Access and Publisher) instead of this one.<br /><br />As far as the software itself, this suite is everything most people need:  Word (the word-processor), Excel (spreadsheet), PowerPoint (presentation software) and OneNote (a note-taking app optimized for laptop and tablet use), with a number of nice improvements over 2007:  They replaced the big round button with a \\""File\\"" tab for a more consistent (and less confusing) interface, image editing is much improved (not Photoshop, but WAY better than before), and PowerPoint transitions are much easier to control now as well.  Not huge stuff, but I do think this version is worth the extra money compared to the 2007 version, and you'll find yourself becoming productive with it in a hurry--especially if you're coming from version 2007 (Version 2003 users will take longer, but it's worth it, promise!)<br /><br />(***UPDATE:  When I originally realized my purchasing mistake, I emailed Amazon asking them if I could return the software.  After re-reading the license terms, however, I realized there would be no way they could.  So, I just purchased the Home and Business version and considered it an expensive lesson.  After writing this review to warn others, however, I was SHOCKED AND STUNNED to find an email in my inbox explaining that my original purchase of the Home and Student version had been cheerfully refunded.<br /><br />This was nearly unbelievable to me.  I clearly didn't deserve a refund, but Amazon gave me one anyway.  Whatever gripe I may have with the Microsoft licensing strategy, it was more than made up for by Amazon customer service.  Wow.  I will never buy software anywhere else after this...)editing is much improved (not Photoshop, but WAY better than before), and PowerPoint transitions are much easier to control now as well.

0,"For some reason Quicken 2015 and Wells Fargo do not work together. I'm dissapointed in Intuit for not disclosing that before I bought 2015 Windows Premier, installed and worked through all the headaches... now trying to revert back to 2012."
1,"Beware that this version lacks a firewall or spam filter. Once you install the product, you will receive a pop up to upgrade to the full version for an additional $25. It costs less to purchase the full product initially."
3,"I am using Quicken Starter Edition 2014 on one home computer with Vista and (now) the referenced edition on a (newer) laptop with Windows 7 SP1. Backing up back and forth between the two versions is not as simple as I would like.  Before I was using Quicken 99 for a number of years with few problems. The two newer versions have taken some gettting used to and each time I log on is a new experience. Converting files from 2014 into 2015 was easier for me with these newer versions, I will admit. I find some of the new features quite helpful. However the reports available are not as informative as I would like."

4,"I have used the various iterations of the H&R Block tax software for several years now. The user interface is clean and clear, no &#34;pizzazz&#34; but very straightforward, just like a good H&R Block tax consultant would be. The questions lead you through all that's needed to complete your return. I have been totally satisfied with the product.<br /><br />You can get it as a CD-ROM or download it directly. The download on my DSL Internet connection took a few minutes, and worked fine from the get-go. You get the key for opening the program via email. This particular program covers both Federal and one state tax preparation. You will have to pay extra if you have more than one state in which to file. Also, there is an extra cost for filing the state taxes online.<br /><br />After you finish the taxes, it reviews it and finds anything that doesn't look just right. In some cases, it just asks you to double-check to make sure you entered the information correctly. Then it allows you to file the Federal taxes by e-File, which is very easy. I found the state e-File to be too expensive to make it worth it. You can also print out all the necessary forms for the state taxes and snail mail it.<br /><br />The Deluxe version is good for most average taxpayers to use. It covers regular income/expenses, investments and small business issues. If you have rental property or complicated investments, you will need to upgrade to the Premium version.<br /><br />I'm not a CPA, nor a tax expert. But I would recommend this software as an easy, and inexpensive, way to accurately determine and file your yearly taxes."
4,"Guess I came to the party late and installed this after update 5 came out. Maybe that was a good thing with most of the problems being fixed.  I have a lot of accounts setup in this, checking, credit cards, investments, money market, mortgage, car loans.  These are all setup to download transactions direct from the respective institution, I was lucky enough that they all supported Quicken.<br />My experience is from not using ANY Quicken version prior to this.  I'm reading that older Quicken versions were much better, maybe so, but I don't know any better.  When you start tying all of your accounts together and one is making a credit to another that's making a debit and so on, it can get complicated.  I can see why some people are having issues, a lot of the issues people are reporting are self-inflicted.  The information put out is only as good as the information put in.  If you're not following the Quicken way getting data in, your results will be disappointing."
1,"Easy to use, bit slow, but the software automatically renewed the subscription at a high costs ($80) that is more than buying a new program."
0,"The description for this product is false, inaccurate and deceiving.<br /><br />This is advertised as a software download, but it is not.  The only item that is downloaded is a document with a code.  The code must be entered on an external website (https://benchprep.com) which only allows access while online.  This can’t be used offline because it isn’t a software download.  So, I have no way to use this while traveling.  Plus, my internet connection is often slow and video does not stream well, so this purchase is pretty much useless to me.<br /><br />Also, the external website only allows access for a limited time.  This isn’t a “purchase” at all – it is a temporary subscription.  The website says I won’t have access after August 2, 2015.  This is NOT listed anywhere in the product description!  Buyer beware!"
4,Great price.
4,Recommended.
2,"I don't like it as much as previous excel versions, but it works pretty much the way you expect. I'm docking one star for not selling the installation media with the device, you can't even save the downloaded installer! This is an awful way to distribute products, but par for the course for a company like Microsoft.<br /><br />Unless you have some crazy macros, I'd really suggest LibreOffice which can handle excel files just fine. Plus, it's FREE. I install it on all my client's computers by default, there's rarely a compelling reason to buy any Microsoft Office product."
4,These flash cards are constantly updated and they are really helping me nail in the pertinent facts.  I highly recommend these as opposed to a crowdsourced anki deck because these have been curated and the facts are highly accurate due to this.

0,"Over simplified, over GUI-fied and not functional.<br />IMAP folders won't sync.

2,"It worked, I got my refund. Turbo tax was way more user friendly than this software and make it a lot easier to go back and adjust things. I am disappointed that I didn't spend the extra money on turbotax.<br /><br />In the event that I get audited and have local support that may change but I don't foresee an audit."
1,"Pros:<br />-- There are a couple of small fixes since 2010 that make it easier to connect to a bank account (or, at least MY bank account).<br />-- Customer service seems to be able to help with basic install/setup.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-- This version does not import all data made available by a bank (or in my case an investment brokerage).  I'm told that earlier versions of Quicken import all of the data - even data from years past - as long as the financial institution makes it available.  This one does not (at least not in all cases).<br /><br />-- This version doesn't include the option of importing old data via a CSV file.  What?!?!  This is a reliable standard that has been used for a long time and one option still available by many financial institutions for importing/exporting data.  Why would you take that ability away?!  Amazing. . .<br /><br />-- Customer support doesn't seem to know how the software works/is supposed to work.  For example, they told me that Quicken will only fetch data for the past 90 days maximum.  However, some of my accounts were pulling data for the past nine months, and others were pulling data for the past 2 years!  How can customer support be expected to help solve my issue if they don't really know how the product works?<br /><br />-- Customer support is quick to point the finger at the financial institution.  When they finally ran out of uneducated guesses, they eventually said that I'd have to contact the financial institution for a resolution.  I was in close contact with tech support at the bank -- someone who seemed to be as willing as I was to put the time and effort into helping track down the problem for Quicken to help them solve it.  But, they didn't seem to want to take advantage of it and, instead, acted as though they expected me to ask the bank to change their system (add QFX export) to work with the Quicken software.  I'm not going to do that.  If Quicken doesn't work correctly with a specific bank/institution, either don't claim that it does - or fix Quicken!<br /><br />In my experience. . .:<br />If you want an application that partially works, Quicken might be OK for you.  However, if you want an application that works comprehensively out of the box and/or comes with a customer support team that's willing/able to help solve bugs, consider looking at other options.  After all, there are plenty of other options out there and the Quicken option caused a lot of headaches for me and resulted in a lot of wasted time trying to get things to work correctly."
0,"Much more complicated than earlier version.  Takes more keystrokes, and as a result, takes more time."
4,"I have never had a problem with this program working correctly. My comments are really for the person who may not be familiar with electronic tax preparation or someone who is concerned by the negative comments. Those with experience will probably not find my comments useful, but are welcome to keep reading.<br /><br />My first experience with a tax program was Kiplinger tax cut program followed by H&R Block home deluxe. I used Turbo tax once years ago and finding it did not provide as much help and information. I have ignored it since, except to note it costs more.<br /><br />Anyone who has a situation past the basic of \\""here is my income and this is how much I paid in taxes\\"" needs to do some research at the source. Most tax programs guarantee their math is correct, they don't guarantee you know what you are doing. H&R Block software connects you to the source - the IRS - as well as providing its own explanation of the interview questions. (Anyone can go to the IRS website, the program simplifies the process.)<br /><br />Simply answering interview questions will only take you so far. Anyone preparing their own tax return needs to have some knowledge of the forms and the tax code. As someone mentioned, the program will question whether someone is truly a dependent. The IRS website goes into great detail on this issue because it is not easily a yes or no depending on your fact situation.<br /><br />Like many things in life, there is a lot of bad information passed around to the point people assume it is fact. Don't assume - look it up. Do you know the rate for mileage for medical and that it is a different rate than using your vehicle for employment or charity? Do you know what items you can expense vs. amortizing the item and which choice is best for your tax situation? The good thing about this program is you can easily override their answer. You can also open the actual tax form to see what you are working on.<br /><br />Using a tax program, I found several things that benefited me directly, all of which H&R Block does well:<br /><br />1. The deduction pro which belongs to H&R Block, has saved me money. I discovered I was consistently undervaluing my donated items. A few years ago that value made the difference between itemizing and not itemizing, which resulted in enough of a difference that I went from owing to receiving a refund.<br /><br />2.  You can create multiple returns to determine if different scenarios provide better outcomes - sometimes separate returns or not claiming someone as a dependent are beneficial, especially if you are trying to obtain college grants and loans. What you lose in taxes can result in significant benefits for a student. If you are in the middle of a divorce, you can figure out how much you lose or gain which can be a negotiating tool in settlement offers. Just make sure when you file your taxes you are in the correct return.<br /><br />3.  The program easily checks the status of your return to confirm receipt and processing. The person who discovers their return was never filed is someone who did not use the program correctly and was too lazy to check it to see the status or they would have known there was a problem. (He must have owed money as I suspect most of us watch for our refunds closely.) One year someone else claimed my son and my return came back because of it. The program told me my return was returned by the IRS.<br /><br />4.  The program allows you to have your refund deposited into more than one account.<br /><br />5. You can save the return as a PDF file. I have put all the PDF files on a USB drive so I had easy access when applying for a mortgage. Being able to save it in a PDF file also makes emailing it easy. The program lets you save just the return or the return with all worksheets. I save it both ways. The PDF file allows me to print specific pages which is helpful for No. 7 below.<br /><br />6. I have the option of printing just my return or printing all my supporting documentation. The latter is a lot of paper, but sometimes necessary to have.<br /><br />7. I itemize so I use the tool boxes that allow me to list items and dollar values and then insert the total, such as doctors, prescriptions and different categories  of expenses incurred in maintaining my professional educational requirements. It helps me budget for the next year and allows me to compare them. That information is useful in negotiating employment benefits.<br /><br />8. It checks your return for things you may have missed or to warn you of possible problems. I know every year it tells me my medical expenses are higher than norm and may trigger an audit. But it has also saved me from accidentally having too many 0s at the end of a number and from a mistyped address.<br /><br />9.  If I am in a good mood I can offer to do the kids' returns.

Great price, great features and for the price on Amazon you can't beat it.<br /><br />While using Kaspersky I have never had a security threat or virus. It stops it before it even starts. I've even installed this on computers that were bombarded with issues/viruses and it cleans it right up.<br /><br />Look no further, great product all around and for this price, you get three licenses to use. Again, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
3,downloaded  quick. key code match 1st try. good options equalizer for sound and visual settings. lot easier than the 3 letter program. better than spending more & using less.
0,"This download doesn't work on a Chromebook. Now, Amazon won't let me return it, even though I could not even download it."
2,i  DID NOT FIND ANY GOOD INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM AND HAVE NOT USED IT YET BY TODAY
2,"The Home module works great for our tax needs.  It works just like it has for the past dozen years.<br /><br />This was our first try with the Business module.  On a Windows 7 laptop, the check boxes and text never lined up correctly.  So we had to hunt and peck to fill in the questions.  They also do not have the state modules.  I would just say this module is a work in progress."
3,seems to work well
2,I am not sure if it was my computer or the program but it stopped working on a program I was doing and would not add any more data.  We had to complete the program for an event on another computer with Illustrator. Debbie Shoup
2,"I needed a product that could take an image of my face and turn it into an amazing figure; so I could land an acting job.  I tried and tried, but I still looked more like Ru Paul than Robert Redford (early years)."
2,"Slowed down my pc considerable but that is perhaps to be expected as my computer is almost six years old.  I had AVG virus and security protector installed on my computer after my computer got \\""highjacked\\"" by a \\""hack\\"".  What a pain in the neck!  Anyway, my only complaint is that with AVG it updates and runs everytime (and I do mean EVERY), I get on the computer which is intrusive.  The Tuneup appears to have not fixed my slowed- down computer problems at all but has added to the problem.  But -- no more viruses at least."
0,"This product doesn't tell you that at the very end, it'll charge you $19.99 for e-filing the state return.  It also won't tell you that it'll charge another $29.99 as a &#34;refund processing fee&#34;.  This should be illegal, and I'll definitely report it to the IRS Office of Professional Responsibility."
2,"While some folks have experienced problems with the Rosetta Stone download, I did not.  I waited for an Amazon Lightning Sale which made the download much more attractive.  Download was smooth and it worked right the first time I started it.  I am able to easily use the online tool set (\\""Totale\\"", I think they call it) without a problem using a Hughesnet satellite connection. Though there is noticeable latency in the connection, the latency does not seem to affect the ability to use the online system.  Lessons are bite-sized and there is a lot of \\""circular review\\"" in the program making it a good learning tool.  It's completely immersive in the sense that it's picture-word/phrase association - no English.  I have found that I'm using Google Translate on some lessons to check grammar, especially in plurals and pronouns.<br /><br />EDIT 7-23-14:  Well I \\""almost\\"" had my first online \\""Studio\\"" session with a coach today.  I say almost because even after all the technical checks were passed the system failed.  My side looked good, I could see my headset and microphone were working OK.  Rosetta Stone Technical support was less than helpful.  I did all the normal stuff, including system reboot and changing browsers/cleaning cookies, and still failed.  By the time we thought we had it fixed, the Studio session expired and I was not able to sign up for a new one until the next day.  Later, I went exploring around my account tab and found that it was permanently linked to the Rosetta Stone \\""Japan Store\\"" and all prices were in Yen.  Another chat with a CSR was singularly unhelpful and they even wanted to take over my computer to poke around to see if they could understand the problem. (I did not oblige).  Rating down to 3 stars."
3,"I've been using Avast Free for about two years now, and it has worked as it should. Granted, I am careful with websites but occasionally a search may lead you astray, and so far I've avoided some virus headaches. It has even caught an infection or two that was backed up on CD-ROM, which AVG hadn't caught. Overall, I'd rate Avast very highly and recommend it."
1,"Unable to import last year's Turbo Tax file because TT saves the 2013 file with instructional pages that can't be deleted and which interfere with the transfer to H%R Block.  Also can't import the filed forms in.PDF file format.  So basically, it can't import!"
0,"First let me say I'm a loyal Amazon customer and very happy with them. They clear understand how to treat a customer with a strong focus on ease of use. Quicken is another story. I recently updated to Quicken 2013 for one reason only - they held me hostage. I was unaware until one day the software informed me that a key benefit for me, sync'ing all my accounts in a one click download, would stop working. Wonder why they aren't clear about this upfront?Beware that you are not purchasing the product, you're simply renting it. My 2010 version was just fine. I'd be happy to continue to use it if would continue to sync up my accounts. Without that it is useless for me. Also as stated by other consumers, the product is buggy. Even the basic sync is not reliable. I simply refuse to deal any enterprise that has this low regard for honest business practices. I will be looking for another product or writing my own before this lease runs out."
2,Some years ago I had avast! & it was good.  Now I am just annoyed by your nagging.<br />I rated avast as OK because i don't really know if they are good or not.<br />Their business practices make me doubt how good they really are.<br />I get constant reminders that unless I buy more avast! my computer is in dire trouble.<br />This makes me feel their free antivirus isn't very good so I am shopping around for<br />something better.  I hate their constant nagging.  They don't really explain why I need<br />to pay for more.
1,I admit my review may not agree with those who are more experienced than I at using this type of software but I can't see me spending the time it would take as a new user to actually learn and use this stuff. There has to be software out there that it doesn't take a degree to use.
4,fantastic antivirus. catches so many threats and removes them.
2,Free price can't be beat. Had some issues though compared to Norton.
0,"This is the worst Quicken ever.  I am not a novice, actually a computer consultant.  Couldn't get this version to install on Vista 64.  Tried everything including the worst ever support.  If you have a choice don't install on Vista although read about problems on Windows 7 and 8 too. It wouldn't even install in Compatibility Mode. Not pretty!"
2,I have been a loyal annual upgrader for many years.  I can say that I have had no historic issues until this year.  It seems that this years upgrade is querky.  I have had no data integrity issues but it is very annoying when attempting to utilize an 2nd monitor.  Quicken does not re-size properly and makes the extended monitor screen dysfunctional.
4,I feel safe knowing my computer is safe and protected. I would recommend this program to everyone I meet. Thanks
1,I've had a version of Intuit's Quicken and all it took was a simple download from my online banking and it took care of itself.
4,Avast has saved me on more than one occasion from new or known bugs. I would not use any other means for protecting my system.
4,Worked
4,"I've always taken my home computer to a computer service store to put on the anti virus programs. I decided to do it myself. I trust Norton, it was the anti virus that had been installed on my computer. I also trust Amazon, so when they offered Norton I ordered it and it was simple to understand, simple to install. I'm very pleased with this product."
2,"Wasn't what I anticipated, but okay under the circumstances."
3,all good!
1,I used this product last year and was quite satisfied.  This year?  No so much.  My computer now freezes and it never did prior to loading this &#34;protection?&#34;  I also now have an increase in junk mail entering my inbox AND my spam mailbox.  I'll have to have one of my computer geek friends take a look at all of the files on the computer and perhaps clean my system.  Will not purchase it next year.
4,Fast and easy to do!  Free to file!  Saves so much time!  LOVE IT!
4,I have used TurboTax for over 2 decades and see no reason to change. I particularly like the option of downloading it through Amazon and the Amazon price is the best. I have a single owner LLC and this version is perfect for me.
3,"I have used this software for the last 4 years. Will use it again next year. My taxes are relatively simple- this software works for me,"
4,"Used turbo tax for years, easy to download and to use.  Would recommend to anyone who does there own taxes."
2,"I have used Quicken for years and just upgraded to 2013 because of the warning of updates not being allowed with my older version.  I use it for general account tracking and check book reconciliation.  I also auto-update/download data from credit card every day or so and brokerage data weekly.  Regular credit card data is fine to help spot identity theft.  However, I have always been frustrated that the brokerage data never matches numbers when I compare it with the brokerage data on line.  The stock, bond and securities price updates never pulls in all the prices for items the brokerage has purchased in my account.  In talking with the brokerage I am always told the problem is with Quicken and there securities symbol data based not being properly maintained up to date with all the symbols.  When I update the account Quicken is constantly putting in \\""place holders\\"" until missing data is entered.  No one what to have to enter volumes of missing data.<br /><br />For years I have added a \\""correction account\\"" and compare the actual value of my brokerage account with the total value in Quicken and enters a large + or - correction factor to make the net worth numbers match.  Hope it gets fixed some year!!!"

4,"Very easy to use, makes complicated portions of tax laws simple. Just follow the steps. Have used it in the past and the importing of prior year records reduces importing of repetitive annual info."
2,"I've used Intuit tax programs for at least 10 years; they are very reliable products.<br /><br />Changes to the 2013 program made both the &#34;It's Deductible&#34; & the W-4 calculator made both tools more difficult to access.<br /><br />Also, the multi-layer user agreement required for the refund bonus gift card had too many strings attached to actually utilize. This was a disappointment."

1,"I don't know if you can consider what I'm going to write a full review, but it is an overview of some of the changes I've noticed (compared to Office 2010) and what I think about them. It's pretty long because I tried to be really thorough. I mostly use Word and Excel, so I'll talk about those most (I don't use OneNote or PowerPoint much, so I can't comment on them much besides causally things I noticed or read). I will focus on the new Metro/Windows 8 look that Office now adopts first. It's about flatness, removal of gradients, simulated 3D elements, and round corners. I gave it the benefit of a doubt, and I can use it, but it's not an improvement or benefits productivity. Some defaults implemented are questionable, like \\""Why? This offers no benefit.\\""<br /><br />==New skins==<br />First off is the default white theme. I have no idea who OK'd this decision. It's silly. There's so much white! The top of the window is white, the ribbon is white, the scroll bars are white, drop down menus in the ribbon have to be white, and many of the icons in the ribbon can only be white or off-white by nature and/or have been changed to white anyways (perfect example is the Insert tab in Word)... all while the work area below the ribbon is usually white too! Everything has a tendency to blend together, and how can it not, since it's all white to begin with. My eye feels like it wants to wander around. And to top it off, the ribbon features low contrast with little color. Things you expect to be black are actually grey or a lightened black (all the fonts used, the outline of the page in Word, the paragraph tools, the separations between columns in the ribbon, the font size increase/decrease are all examples) and a lot of the color has been toned down and desaturated. This low contrast gives the ribbon an even WHITER feel. Even the separators between groups in the Ribbon has been lightened to grey and are less noticeable. I think their idea was to \\""subdue\\"" everything so it's not competing for attention, but it has the opposite effect. Going back to the Insert Tab in word, it's almost like the icons/commands available blend in with the background due to all of this and the flatness. Even hovering over an item is somewhat dull. Without any shading, gradients, or contrast, it's like the UI and work area compete with each other. Nothing really \\""pops out\\"" as a control element. Something just feels wrong. In Office 2010, I use the Silver theme (I abhor the default blue theme), which is another non-colored theme, but it has none of the problems of Office 2013. The work area was the focus of attention. And due to the brightness of the white theme too in 2013, if your monitor is not very bright, it can look a little dull, but too bright, and it can be fatiguing. They have two grey themes, light and dark, but they should really be called \\""barely darker than stark white\\"" and \\""slightly dark than that\\"". Both are better for separating elements, so why was white chosen by default? Maybe because they were boring... just flat areas of grey and are not eye candy at all. And about eye candy, not all of the icons could easily take to the new minimalist flat look. Some things like Equation, Symbol, Chart, and Conditional Formatting look good, but other elements look ugly, like the Filter icon, and others are just so basic, like the page tools which are basically white rectangles and do not \\""stick out\\"" from the background like I said earlier. So from the get go, Office has been uglfied.<br /><br />==Ribbon==<br />The ribbon also features ALL CAPS IN IT'S SECTIONS, LIKE HOME/INSERT/REVIEW/ETC. You can easily change it, but again, why was this done by default? They said it helped separate the tabs, but this was never an issue in previous versions and many people look to change this when first starting. The ribbon is also vertically longer in ALL programs by a tiny degree. But the worst thing is the new File menu. When you launch the File menu, it overtakes the whole screen, similar to the Windows 8 Start Screen. 2010 does it too, but it opens it up like a Ribbon section... 2013 hides the other ribbon sections and the even File button (it changes it into another icon). It drives me nuts because I HATE how it looks. It's just ugly. Gone are icons for the buttons too, like Open/Save/Share/Export, now they are all just plain text. And when using Open, Save/Save As, more mouse movement and clicks are necessary to do the same amount of work as 2010 (assuming you don't use SkyDrive, which I don't) due to the \\""backstage\\"" that has been implemented. Same when you launch any program (Word/Excel/OneNote) or attempt to create a New Document - now you need to choose a template to start with, or click Escape to get a blank document. This was an annoyance at first but I actually like this feature. It might encourage more people to use/make templates. You can turn most of these changes off, and I found how to do it quite quickly, but there is no way to turn off the File Menu's Open using the backstage, so now I just pinned it to the quick launch toolbar. They also introduced auto hiding the entire ribbon, but it was implemented how it should be done. Unlike auto hiding the Windows 7 taskbar, you need to click on the 2013 Ribbon after hovering over it to get it to come up. Effectively it requires more one click on every use, when it could have just been on hover over.<br /><br />==Animations + Missing shortcuts==<br />The entire suite now features more GPU acceleration than 2010, which is great, and it also brings a new animation fluidity. In Word, the cursor is ever so slightly is behind what you are typing. You can't fully see it, but you can if you just hold down a single key (the cursor is always BEHIND by one character then). I think its fine though, much better than how it worked in the preview. Menus are also a bit \\""different\\"" when they pop out, it's subtle but I like it. Excel also has a different fluidity when selecting cells and selections are colored and sometimes animated. There is a way to disable these changes (via Windows, the Registry, or by just turning off hardware acceleration), but why not make this an option in the program? I know people would use it. Mysteriously absent also is the fast way to use Ruler and Split View in Word and Excel. Before, you used to be able to just drag from the top to create a split view, or use the button below to make the ruler visible, but now you need to manually switch to the View tab and change those options. Why was this implemented? I loved this simple feature. It's anti-productivity by changing it! If they could afford to increase the length of the ribbon (for no reason), they can afford to keep those two shortcuts.<br /><br />==Font Rendering==<br />Office 2013 also changed font rendering... fonts now look hideous. It has a look to it that is both blurry and/or too crisp simultaneously. It's like the font smoothing is too prominent. You can try to fix it via disabling hardware acceleration, subpixel smoothing, or updating your drivers, but none of those methods worked for me. I did some research and found 2 links at Microsoft Answers. I'll save you some time though and summarize: the new rendering (which is also present in Windows 8) does not support ClearType. Why you ask? Well, there is no official answer from MS, but somebody did post a bunch of reasons about it in the context of tablets... ClearType doesn't rotate with the screen, ClearType font animations don't look right, plus their new system is \\""good enough\\"" for high pixel density screens (so much for monitors). The new rendering looks only greyscale too, not RGB based. This whole issue is pathetic. The Metro philosophy emphasized using fonts and typography in design (for I'm assuming a benefit)... yet they can't even get font rending right and offer no flexibility with it. Who is responsible for this!?<br /><br />==Word==<br />Word is pretty much the same 2010, changes are sprinkled around. Headings can now be collapsed and I LOVE this feature (the only problem is that it captures ALL non heading text under it, so you may want to work in a table if you only want certain text to be collapsible). The Ribbon now has a Design tab dedicated to Themes, Colors, fonts/etc (this takes the place of the Change Styles button in the home tab in 2010). One annoying thing though is that when changing styles, you no longer can see a text list of styles... you see a preview now (which is useful) with a text hover over, but having to find a style by look is not as fast as knowing what it's called (and there is no option to change this). The new default fonts and paragraph styles are slightly changed too, there's a new Word 2013 style set (one change is 1.08 line spacing vs 2010 at 1.15). Word also gives an option to return to the exact location where you last saved a document, that's really nice. The reading mode is ok but lacking in options and I don't think of Word as a reading program (especially with the font rendering problems). Several functions that result in popups in 2010 are now in side panels, such as Spelling. And on the subject of spelling, apparently Microsoft doesn't want us to use AutoCorrect much. Autocorrect is removed from right click menus and the spelling panel (it used to be there in 2010). If you use this a lot, to correct words it doesn't catch (such as \\""posoin\\"" > poison), you'll have fun manually digging it out in options every time and then finally entering the changes. The dictionary has been removed too and now you need to sign into a Microsoft Account to use it (since it is an Office Web App now and a MS account is required for all Web Apps), but oddly the thesaurus has been left in place. The bottom status bar (with spelling count, view options, etc) is slightly larger and doesn't show outline or draft in the GUI options. Track Changes has had comments cleaned up, but for some reason it now doesn't tell you when it gets to the end of a section or document (why remove that?). When using CTRL+F for find, you now presented with the less options version stored in the Navigation Panel... more mouse and clicks required to see all options than the Find/Replace one. So more mouse movement is required for a commonly used feature... One last thing - if you choose to not upgrade, but instead install 2013 alongside 2010, you may run into some problems. 2010 (and occasionally 2013) will sometimes show \\""Please wait while Windows configures\\"" when you start them. They take a LONG time to complete on their own, and even when cancelling them you need to somewhat wait... 2010 gives me an error when I do this and says I need to repair a functionality that is no longer working, but whatever it is must not be critical because it loads after anyways and works just fine. Also, your new blank Documents will launch in 2010 compatibly mode by default in Word 2013 and when saving them, you will get a prompt saying it will upgrade them to the newest format.<br /><br />==Excel==<br />Excel has quite a bit of changes. The formula bar and name box are slightly larger, the X and check mark icon always visible, and there is a lot of padding (blank space) around it. Why was this done? It only makes it less compact. In addition, the sheet selection at the bottom is also larger too, so by default, you can now only see 45 cells, not 47. Do elements really need to be more prominent? The entire Layout tab for Charts is gone from the Ribbon too and I find this disappointing. You can manually recreate it again though. I didn't recreate the whole thing, but I tried doing a bit of it to see if I could and I could, so I'm guessing the rest should work too. Anyways, the replacements they've implemented are a text only menu accessed via a + button at the top right when selecting a chart, or a visual version like in 2010 via Design Tab > Chart Layouts > Add Chart Element. Formatting has also been changed a lot too. Instead of being a popup, it's nowa docked panel at the right side and completely reorganized. It contains the same options but everything is somewhat moved around. And if you used PowerPivot, you can kiss it goodbye. The feature has been completely removed. It is now only available in Office 365 (subscription) or the Professional Plus edition, which is the most expensive non subscription version of Office and cannot be bought via retail as it's only available through volume licensing (it's easier to obtain illegally than legally - talk about completely botching this up!). Another thing - remember when I earlier said that a lot of UI elements are grey, not black? Yeah, it applies that style by default to charts too - all the once black elements are now the 35% lighter version. I couldn't find how in program to change this default action to black, but it still uses black as it's automatic color. Like I really want to have to manually change text colors each time now. There is now a Quick Analysis feature at the bottom of data tables, it gives you shortcuts to Conditional Formatting, suggested Tables, Pivots, etc. It reminds me of the Mini Toolbar and when the Ribbon was introduced... it makes common/useful functions more upfront/visible for well, people who haven't explored much and don't know everything that is possible. It empowers them by showing them what it capable and a preview. I don't use it that much but it's a nice touch. Also, in PivotTable options, 2013 shows you less things to do yet takes up more space. Now you have to right click to Sort/Filter as well as \\""summarize values by\\"" and \\""show values as\\"" (can't add those last 2 back to the Ribbon).<br /><br />==Additional Features==<br />I don't really use the Cloud features of Office 2013, but I did log into my MS account to see what it could do. Useful if you do use their cloud services. You can open/save directly to the cloud, email things as attachments, create web browser presentations, and other social media site sharing all within theprogram. You can also post things to blogs (a bunch of third party ones too, like WordPress). Office 2013 also introduces Apps. They're jumping on the app bandwagon, but it's actually a good thing because it helps popularize and consolidate additional functionality, instead of looking for independent add-ons. There's a Word app called \\""TaskIt\\"" that creates task list panel. Simple but really useful. Things are more interesting on the Excel side though. Ablebits/Tyrant Ventures has a lot of free, useful Excel apps, such as a random number generator (for those who don't want to use a formula and want a random value written directly into a cell), change case options (like in Word, but without having to go to Word), and Range Calculations (for when you want to change a bunch of cells by constant values (add, subtract, etc). Maybe in the future Apps will be something that draws people to upgrade, but right now there aren't loads of apps. Another thing to remember is they are WEB based apps - they aren't available offline, they are tied to your Microsoft account, and you are probably at the mercy of the developer because you don't install them (Microsoft itself officially says \\""An app for Office is basically a webpage that is hosted inside an Office client application\\""). This means that if an app changes and you don't like it, well, you don't have a way to downgrade and can't use a saved installer for a previous version. The built in App panel/manager viewer is pretty dinky too. You're better using your browser to get and manage apps.<br /><br />==Overall==<br />Office 2013 is not an upgrade to 2010 (actually with everything I mentioned it is a downgrade). Visually, it has been changed without productivity in mind (not to being somewhat ugly), has questionable new defaults, and not any must have features. The removal or moving of certain features also makes it feel somewhat dumbed down. Only for people who really want the newest or extensively use Microsoft's Cloud."
3,Never had an issue except the whole pay for e-file thing (not all product issue).  I will likely continue using next year.
3,"Chris gave a good review that summarizes the push to add new features and fix as many old bugs as possible. I will add a review of some features that I know have been requested by customers in the past.<br /><br />1.  For the lack of a known terminology, those of you who want to enter data in your registers &#34;upside down&#34;,  that is, new entries at the top of the register instead of the bottom; you can now do this and it seems to work as reliably as the original way. I expect the next round of complaints of this method will be people who want Quicken 'upside down' to exactly match their bank statements line by line.  I can not see how this will happen.<br /><br />2. One Intuit Password.  Many people have requested less password entry while inside Quicken.  This year if you elect OIP you will be prompted for you Intuit Password when you open a file, and that is the last time you are prompted for it.  You must make your Vault Password be your Intuit ID and you must choose to have the data file password protected with your Intuit ID.  Those two done, you will be prompted when you open a file for use and that is it.  I think for safety, Quicken also requires you to enter your Intuit Id to print your Vault.  I guess that is in case you do not close down the program and go do something else, that another person can not print the ID's and Passwords from the Vault.  That could be a disaster.<br /><br />Those are the main features that were added this year.  As Chris mentioned many other things that were not working well in 2014 are now fixed and working properly.  The two new features are Credit Score which is available in Deluxe version and the X-Ray Portfolio Analyzer, Powered by Morning Star is available in Premium or higher.<br /><br />I did not test either of those, as I use Deluxe and do not have investments to test in higher versions.  My personal opinion of Credit Score tracking is that it is a scam, to start with, that many people think is important.  I am aDave Ramsey guy and could care less about credit scores.<br /><br />2015 is a solid stable version and I know that many bugs from prior years are on the fire to be fixed in the next few months and have been assigned to development teams."
4,Great price!
4,"Enhanced payroll is very easy to use and I don't have to think about a thing.  I get notifications when I need to pay and with a few clicks, I'm done and back to working on something else.  Very useful and a great time saver."
3,McAfee is an  awesome product. It does what I need it to do no hassels.
3,"Software work well, with some minor, unusual, strange results.  After understanding these unexpected results you will find a work-around and avoid further frustration/confusion.  Their software &#34;wants to check for updates&#34; every time you start the program, and accepting the update option becomes a little confusing.  They send you to the same page where one downloaded the program the first time, the wording is less than clear, and it appears that you're downloading a completely new version, that &#34;maybe&#34; a test version(?).  There could/should be a better/cleaner path for updating the software.  Or, as I did - turn off their option to check for updates completely.  Their screen capture of videos is excellent, just fails to tell you that, after the capture, you need to convert the capture to a video format.  But, once you learn that the output is really great.  All in all I'd certainly recommend the software and would purchase it again."
0,"After over 10 years of using Basic, the 2014 version is no longer useful for me. Like others i used Basic because it was simple to complete 1040 and supporting schedules A,B,C, D and E. Paying $80 for Premier compared to $30 for Basic in 2013 is unreasonable. I do not use or need guided interview or diagnostics. Premier has no added value to me. I am switching to H&R Block.<br /><br />Also, I  have used Turbo Tax for Business to prepare a 1065 and K1s for a LLC for the past 6 years. I never before considered options other than Turbo Tax; the actions of Turbo Tax this year demonstrate that other alternatives have to be considered.  K Magee"
4,This is a good product that covers a broader spectrum of potential issues than some other products. Have had very good experience with it for many years.
2,I'm sure product works well but I had an old 2012 version of quicken deluxe and file conversion is not compatible with this product. You must get quicken deluxe 2013 to convert old files to new version. So I had to request a refund for the starter Edition.
0,"I've used Quicken for years. This is an absolute dog of an update. It kills my computer. The biggest issue is that it has just deleted a vast number of expense categories in my category list. So, when I say the categories themselves are gone, this means that I have years of records that are now randomly uncategorized. Talk about years of record-keeping just corrupted in one update process. It has made changes to my accounts in it. Forgotten names of currently used accounts. Brought back old, closed accounts, given them old balances and won't let you delete them. Doesn't even start without several tries of clicking the program start several times. It has removed most of your access to control OneStep Update and pin vault; and in the process screwed up all the accesses so you already had so you really do need to gain access to fix them. But you can't. It tries to duplicate accounts from Chase Bank every time you open it. It doesn't try to duplicate accounts from anywhere else, it just really wants me to have a lot of accounts from Chase, And it deleted all my register information from Chase that I had tracked in Quicken 2012. Tech support has been even more mind-shatteringly useless. Really a terrible update that's not ready for prime time."
1,"Like many others here, I have been using TurboTax since the beginning, with one exception about a decade ago, when I used what I then considered to be an inferior product.  But I noticed last year that I was bumped into a higher category based on having a few rental properties and a sale of a property and it appears the same thing is happening this year, except now it's a further higher category.  I've done all the work, but by ordering online directly from TT with my financial institution's discount code, I have the option to simply copy my work onto paper or another tax program.  In the past, I felt such a tactic to be dishonorable and always paid Intuit.  I'm beginning to have second thoughts since Intuit is acting dishonorably here by automatically moving me to Premier despite the fact that I started at a certain price point with Deluxe.  There are numerous discount codes for H&R Block online.  I've found one which will decrease my cost to $17.99 for a Federal Deluxe filing.  Let your finger(s) do the walking."
4,"I have been using this product for years. It really helps me manage my finances, investments, and help my wife (who always does our tax returns) with accurate tax information based on various reports."
3,"Turbo Tax has been a pleasant surprise, It was very user friendly, and the help feature was very handy."
3,Turbo Tax did everything I expected.  The only difficulty was in correcting an earlier input.  Turbo Tax is difficult for me to review and change things.  I had to get help for that.
1,"We have used Quicken since it ran on DOS: 20 or so years.  It was good then, and Intuit was good.  But in recent years the software has gotten bloated and seems buggier and worse ith every release.  Why don't they just debug it and make it work right??!!  We'd still be happy to pony up $40 to Intuit every three years, but just make it work!<br />We &#34;upgraded&#34; from Quicken 2013 to this, and again, it's worse.<br />We are looking at MoneyDance and GnuCash and will switch soon.<br />Goodbye, Quicken!  We had some good times, but it's over now.<br />Two stars, for old times sake."
2,"I'm a student of several foreign languages including Japanese, Arabic, Farsi, and Hebrew. Office suites for Windows have the option to purchase language packs that allow for formatting that I need to use but these are unavailable for Office for Mac. That being said, it's useable, but if you do word processing or presentations in languages that use non-Latin scripts, especially right-to-left scripts, exercise caution when considering purchasing this because I've encountered serious formatting problems for Arabic."
2,Ok product. Upgraded from 2008 version. Had no problems with upgrade. Am now able to download bank & credit card transactions to Quicken. Like it.
3,It does the job for personal tax filing.
3,Easy enough to understand!
4,"I've been using this video editing software on the go with my Windows Laptop and Desktop. Coming from iMovie, this software actually works great for what I'm using it for.<br />I love the downloads as well where you can download free soundtrack, themes, templates, etc from their website without additional costs! Also great support in regards of updates on their products to continue to add features and also fixing bugs.<br />I use this software to do my gaming youtube videos as well as walkthough, tech reviews, etc.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great software with lots of features and tools, this is the software to get without having to spend Sony Vegas or Final Cut Pro."
3,"A great product, but I purchased it because the Basic version was no longer available.  While it did everything that I needed, it offered much more than I actually needed.  My home is paid for and my wife gets one 1099 and I get two, with some various interest statements, so our return is fairly easy.  While the Deluxe model handled that with ease, I felt that it was overkill for our return.  The Basic version would have been adequate for me.  Just my thoughts...."
4,I have used this program for a few years. It has always done what I wanted. Recently I upgraded my computer and OS. My Movavi Video Suite 9 did not work too well in the new system. Movavi staff helped correct my problem and then offered the current version (11) at a very reasonable price. They were very fast in responding to my concerns.
0,"I have used this program since 1993. This year will be the last. I found I had to upgrade to Premier for one item on a Schedule E. I read the reviews back in January, but was happy in the past, so I went with TT once again. this was a BIG MISTAKE. Now it will not allow me to use the &#34;free&#34; state download. They want another $40 for the convenience to do this? I tried several recommended &#34;fixes&#34; without success. While once a big fan, I will never use this program again."
4,"If you need QuickBooks, this is where to get it.  We opted for the Pro because we do not require internet access to our book keeping."
2,"Power2go has its pros and cons...  pros.. price , user friendly, lots of apps.... cons... crash's at times .. make sure your video card and processor up up to snuff ..!!"
0,"I am infuriated that I have to set up an account with Microsoft, using personal information, to be able to download software I purchased for work.  You don't need my phone number, birth date, or gender to let me put Microsoft Office on my new laptop.  The obvious pending switch from downloadable software to subscription based software makes me want to stop using computers all together!  I will create an account with fake information because I cannot return my purchase, but I will never purchase Microsoft again."
4,"This is the best antivirus program I've used and I've used quite a few.  I had 2 Trojans on my computer and this program was the only one - after using Kapersky, Malwarebytes, and Norton that found them!  I also like how it protects me from dangerous websites.  The others say they do, but AVG doesn't just make promises.  It delivers.  Great product!"
4,"The upgrade took about 5 minutes (on a fast laptop); procedure was simple, right click &#34;My Computer&#34;, click on add new features, enter code, and everything is downloaded and updated automatically. Painless and quick. Hyper-V works great!"
2,Office for mac is retarded i haven't used it yet but all i wanted is to change a pages file to work with word and was told i needed office for mac to do so well i don't and feel retarded waste of money actually its most likely better dammit 3 stars
3,"I buy this not a higher end, because I know what items i'm looking for. I use it just because it could take small business taxes too."
3,Cheap quick install and cheaper than other sites. Program was a little different to get use to I learned on a much older version but I was able to figure it out recently fast.
3,"My third year using this H&R Block downloaded version for my small business, and I'm still a happy customer. Easy walk through that imports the previous years basic info, eliminating a lot of  work.    This year the only slightly annoying feature is the 'update'  as a notification states that the next Federal update for windows is on, or before Feb. 12. You could still file before the update, but no one seems to know what happens if you file BEFORE the update? Not sure if it's H&R, the Federal Government, or Windows fault for the late update, but it certainly should have been completed long before Feb. 12. I can't seem to find out for sure if this package will submit a 1040X (extension) if the update requires any substantial changes    If not for the late update (also had to wait for State update to file) this would have been 5 stars, and I do recommend, and I'll continue to use the H&R Premium download from Amazon.  ...but someone please speed up the updates for early filers.    UPDATE: 2/12/15 The latest update was installed, and even though I already filed, no further action seemed to be needed as nothing was changed for me. So even though I'm still not 100% sure about updates, I can only conclude updates are for extraordinaire circumstances."
2,I ordered twice by mistake.  I need a refund
4,"Excellent price for Norton Internet Security.  Plus, download function is easy.  Best thing about Norton software is product support.  Whenever I have trouble with installing software, Norton support is there."
0,"Their software did not include one of the forms that was needed for my state return.  Subsequently, Indiana says I filed late since my \\""on time\\"" return was rejected and deducted over $200 from my refund.  Customer service are morons, who can't access any info or transfer you to someone who can.  Jumping through hoops I don't need to jump through right now and all because I cannot rely on the tax software I chose to do it's job!!"
1,With Quicken 2014 I have lost access to my investment accounts. Attempts to access these accounts causes a system crash. A plea to Quicken Support has had no result. Been using Quicken since 1993 but can't recommend Quicken 2014.
1,I could not save MP4 video files
1,"I wish I could get my money back. I bought Quicken thinking it would work at least as well as Mint and Mint Bills, but this software is lame. It was such a hassle to setup. It won't sync with my 401(k), which was the point of upgrading for me. Very disappointed."
3,"I have been using Elements 11 now for about a month. It is a new learning experience since some of the steps I used to do are quite different. Getting used to the different placement of the Undo, Redo and other icons takes some getting used to. Also accessing hidden tools have changed. Since I have been using elements for over 5 years, I move the cursor to the old places automatically and things don't happen. I will get used to the new format eventually.<br />I love the new light colored background, the ability to use the entire screen for a picture, the new Sketch filters, and the simplicidy of accessing the Quick, Guided and Expert mode.<br />I wish it was simpler to get to the offline help.<br />In all, as usual lots of new tools and things to learn so that my pictures can be better.<br /><br />Rosita"
3,good
4,"NEVER  a question of whether or not Norton is securing my system...always checking and reporting.  Have tried the rest, back to the BEST!"
3,QuickBooks is a solid base to  my business.  Just wish you didn't have to upgrade every 3 years.
4,Needed it for my new Macbook Pro and saved about $20 buying it here. Either way it is still expensive! Works well on my Mac and haven't had any problems. Download was relatively fast. What more can I say?
3,I think this program is as good as any others out there - not sure if I go along with the best  refund sware out there but ????.
0,Once you have the software installed do not uninstall it or it will crash your computer.
1,I can't get this to work with my online banking no matter what I do. Other than that it is good. I have always used quicken for all my financial needs and this one is just as good except for the problem with the one step online banking . I have to go to my bank and download the quicken file.
1,"I had forgotten how bad PC software is, especially when written of Apple computers! The interface really is bad and it still keeps asking me for the software license serial numbers."
3,Easy to use and does the job.
4,Have used for several years. Very satisfied with ease of use. Have found to be very thorough and complete. Will use again
4,"I've used this for over a year and I like it better than Microsoft Office. It has everything that you need for free. If you're worried about format, it gives you the option to export your text documents as pdfs so that everyone can open them."
1,"I had trouble with the new version for about a week.  Since I don't have a mobile device, I can't really see any difference in this version."
1,"quicken runs like something that would have been written by civil servants from the old soviet union.  I've been using quicken for 15 years and this iteration is particularly maddening.  while there's a lot quicken 2015 can do, the program is clunky and unresponsive.  first, when upgrading from a previous generation (in my case quicken 2012 because the nice people at intuit won't support their programs after three years - buyer beware), the existing data in quicken home inventory could not be imported to quicken 2015.  i have done extensive research online and from what i can gather intuit changed the file format for home inventory data and there doesn't seem to be a way to convert it to the new format, one has to re-enter all the data from scratch.  the program for no apparent reason will seemingly randomly change your program to particular formats and default options which are different than what you have set as the default options in quicken &#34;preferences&#34; or to previous default options of the program itself.  intuit has a virtual lock on the personal finance software market with no serious competitors, and it shows.  They have little incentive it seems to create a top quality product or provide good customer service."
0,"I have had the Cyberlink PowerDVD 9 software for years and it works fantastic on Windows XP and Windows 7 with ISO files.  Then I bought a brand new Sony Flip 15A Ultrabook which has Windows 8.1 on it, but the Cyberlink PowerDVD 9 software doesn't work properly - yet it is the best (fastest and most powerful) computer I now own.  The PowerDVD 9 software installed with no issues on Win 8.1 and it played my home movie DVDs with no issue, BUT it won't play the home movie Blu-Rays.  Cyberlink software tells me my drivers are outdated, but they aren't, they are all current and updated.  I installed the Cyberlink BD Advisor as it recommended and I passed all tests perfectly.  The issue isn't with my new Ultrabook or Blu-ray playback, it is with the interaction of PowerDVD 9 and Windows 8.1.  So I read on a couple forums it was Cyberlink's way to get you to buy the new software because earlier versions don't work with Win 8.1....nice.....or not!!  And of course, they won't give us a patch to make it work.<br /><br />So out of curiosity, I downloaded the Cyberlink PowerDVD 13 Ultra 30 day trial off the Cyberlink website to see if all the reports are right....sure enough, it played the Blu-ray home movies on Win 8.1, but honestly, not as well as PowerDVD 9 does.  When the Blu-Ray ISO first loads on Win 8.1 with PowerDVD 13 Ultra, there is no sound.  The only way to get the sound to work is to switch from \\""Classic Mode\\"" (which is best for laptops) to \\""Cinema Mode\\"" (which is designed for a remote, which I don't have with a laptop).  Then the audio will play once you switch modes.  So to make the software work as it should with a laptop, you have to then switch back again to \\""Classic Mode\\""....so it is about a three or four minute process just to get audio to work right.  Then all is good, if you call it that.  Again, PowerDVD 9 NEVER did this.<br /><br />And as far as buying the PowerDVD 13 Ultra on Amazon's website:  Right now it is charging $70.61 for a digital download.  Last week, swear to you, the digital download was $44 from the same Amazon Digital Download vendor.  So you are telling me, for a digital download, which has no physical copies to run out of stock on, suddenly goes up that much in a single week?  What's going on with that?<br /><br />I am frustrated because Cyberlink's PowerDVD 13 Ultra isn't as good as my Cyberlink PowerDVD 9 software, yet they are sort of forcing you to purchase the new software if you want the Blu-ray ISO files to work.  Which is ironic, because I read on another customer review on this Amazon site where Cyberlink actually responded to the post, that Cyberlink doesn't force you to buy the newest version to make the older software work, and that they support all of their versions - yet this isn't true.  Unless they could please respond to this and help me get my PowerDVD 9 to work on Win 8.1.<br /><br />I'm just afraid it'll be just a short amount of time until Cyberlink doesn't support this 13 version either and makes you then buy their newest one instead.  Ugh!t week, swear to you, the digital download was $44 from the same Amazon Digital Download vendor.

1,Big impact on performance.  Stops all internet access randomly for long periods (tens of minutes).
2,"Turbo Tax is priced at about $40..and it charges 40 bucks for every additional state (it provides one state for free)..if your work requires you to file at more than one state, steer clear of Turbo Tax.."
3,"Just another iteration. Different interface, new features, heavy cloud marketing. I'm sticking with 2010 but this is as fine as any other version in the past 2 decades."
2,First off I use TurboTax every year; hard to imagine doing my taxes without it. Over the years I've experimented with various versions to see if they provide much enhancement over the Basic edition. This year I decided to give the Premier version a retest and well I'm still not seeing much to recommend it over the cheaper versions. Maybe something will crop up as I get into it deeper but not yet. So by all mean get TurboTax but you can probably save some $$ but getting one of the less pricy versions.
2,"I found that I have a lot to learn about how this version works. I have used older versions with some degree of competence, but this one challenges me,"
2,"I tried installing the Quickbooks Pro 2013 software at my office.  After completion, the balances picked up 2006.  It took an hour to try and fix it.  Called Quickbooks support.  It took two technicians, three specialists, and one accountant three hours to repair and get me the correct balances.  The next day, the old balances came back and, again, couldn't change the balances.  First phone call, I was on hold for two hours with no response.  Tried a different number for the second call and it went directly to hold with no message.  Went to live chat where I was told I'd get a call back within ten minutes.  An hour later, tried another number where Thomas cleared everything and was very polite and helpful.  Today, opened and all was ok.  I do NOT like the new format.  Have to enlarge screen every time I open to see the numbers and names.  When writing checks, I need more space in the \\""Account\\"" column and, so far, can't find where to widen it.  Quickbooks called back after the problem was fixed.  Finally, they sent two e-mails requesting feedback.  There was no place on either form to respond.  This fiasco took over 10 hours of my office time."
3,I really enjoy Quickbooks. Everything is very easily accesible.
4,This is just  code that was used to upgrade my windows 7 home premium to win 7 professional.  It worked perfectly with no issues.
2,My biggest disappointment with Turbo Tax was it stated I would have one free state tax filing and then they charged me $19.99 for filing my state taxes.  Other than that it was a satisfactory program.
0,"I thought I bought the version that included State, but it did not. By the time I found this out, it was too late and they charged me more than what I paid for this version. Was not happy. They should just charge you a small amount for State since you already bought this product."
3,"Good tool for managing credit, checking, savings accounts.  Nice mobile app component which is great for receipts.  Loss one star due to some minor but inconvenient bugs in mobile app and intuitiveness of desktop interface."
2,Not a lot features but will do for card and flyer projects. Thanks.
1,We were not able to DL this to 3 PCs. I do not recommend downloading this version; better to outright by the software on CD.
2,It gets harder every year to figure out the total cost before buying it.  Maybe Intuit thinks it's necessary to play games with different pricing packages but I resent it.
3,Lots to learn since my original version 4.0 and not enough time to right now.  Looking forward to working with it over the summer.
1,"I have tried several times to download this software but it duplicates the message to install. It will not download, I wasted my money"
4,Best price found<br /><br />Easy to download<br /><br />That is all I have to say but need to fill out the words
4,"if you are looking for non-add supported web-based simple  financial accounting system, similar to Mint(but without advertising), this version of Quicken is good. It is not a continuation of the PC quicken platform- this is a different product. It includes good web integration, allowing for synchronization with a phone app, so you can maintain and access a record of ongoing financial activity against budgets. I have had no problems in 7 months with 2 credit card accounts and 3 bank accounts, plus an investment account."
4,"A thumbs down and then two thumbs up!  First off I purchased liteCam HD to record PC game play.  After an easy installation I started the record process, launched the game, played a longer game than I should have, stopped the recording and went to preview it.  It only recorded my desktop screen (and my mouse movements) but not the game.  I checked all the settings, read through a bunch of help options and was NOT a happy camper.  I contacted their support team who promptly informed me that I needed liteCam Game instead of HD.  That's where this review takes a turn.  I was prepared to be very upset at the bait and switch, BUT, their support team was fabulous!!!  She asked what I was planning on recording, informed me the liteCam Game was the better option, had me uninstall the HD version, provide a link and activation code for the Game version and off to the races I went!!!  Probably the best customer service experience I have had in a LONG time!!!  The best news, the version I have works just as I expected."
4,love it
2,The accounting portion is ok but the property management is poor
3,"Pretty much the same. It's a solid product, but I wish it didn't auto-fill the categories with the last entry."
0,"The stars in this review are all to do with the changes that Intuit Turbo Tax has put in place for 2014 tax software. 1- Advertise that it is free and then add a charge to file... 2- force your loyal customers to find out why this is not the same product for the past years.<br />My advice to intuit is take your feedback seriously. If, you are going to surprise your customer this is what you should NOT be doing. If, you want customer loyalty this is NOT the type of experience that will keep customers returning."
1,OK
3,"Easy to use, love the credit card function. Wish it had a few more functions without upgrading and spending the extra money."
2,Had to download 4 times before it would work.  Try the free download first to see if you even like this product.
2,I have used Turbo Tax for many years but this year Turbo Tax made charges to it program.  I got a copy last year just like this years copy and I was told that it was a mistake and they downloaded a new copy.  The copy last year was limited copy that Turbo was testing  and they then released it this year.  I have the most basic tax needs and I did my taxes and then when I went to file on line I was directed to upgrade my program at cost of $39..99 on top of the fee that I had already paid.  I was told to wait until February 7th and Turbo was upgrading free.  I will not be using Turbo Tax next year.  Just up the cost of the program but do not sell it and then tell customers that they must pay more after they input tax information and want to file. I always file EZ so why do I have to upgrade my software.
2,"Well, where to start on this....<br /><br />I've been a career long Windows user and switched to Mac about 1 month ago.  The core programs Word, Excel, and Powerpoint all work great and as expected on my Mac. The new versions of these core productivity programs are really slick and full of powerful features.  Way better than trying to use Open Office.<br /><br />MS Outlook works fine as an email client, way better than the lame Mac Mail that comes with Mac OS x Lion (10.7.3).  I use it with Gmail and it works flawlessly there.  I also use it with MS Exchange which leaves a lot to be desired.  If you're one of the unlucky persons who needs to connect to an older Exchange server (prior to Exchange 2007), then you'll have to use the IMap protocol instead of the native Exchange protocol and this means that Calendaring will be severely limited.  You won't be able to see other co-workers calendars to know what time slots are free.<br /><br />Even worse is the fact that Outlook maintains it's own Contact list that is separate from the built-in Mac Address book.  The product offers a Sync feature, but I've found it to be completely unreliable and useless, especially if you are trying to keep contacts in synch between iPhone, Mac, and Outlook."
3,"Having a few issues, I'm sure they will be corrected."
3,"Good product, nice seller."
2,Its OK.  More features than reasonably needed.<br />Earlier versions easier.
4,"I upgraded from version 11 to 12 to improve the rendering speed.  Version 12 is a 64-bit application and also includes the ability to use the GPU (graphics card) to render.  I've not been disappointed.  Rendering time for a sample video went from 33 minutes with version 11 to 13 minutes using version 12, once I found the place to turn GPU rendering on.  (On the render dialog, select Customize Template, see the drop down box near the bottom of the Video tab.  My Radeon graphics card uses the OpenCL setting.  I believe Nvidia cards use the CUDA setting.)<br /><br />I haven't noticed any problems and my version 11 files have been opened with no problems.  Version 12 also includes a preferences file for my Shuttle Express controller.  The sound effects shipped with version 12 appear to be the same as those from version 11.  Most of the music is also the same, but there are a few new tracks.<br /><br />Prospective new users need to realize that while this is &#34;consumer&#34; level software, it is quite high-end and does have a fairly steep learning curve.  If you are only looking to put together a few clips of a dance recital, there are probably better and easier choices."
4,Works good simple to use
4,I like that concern for viruses are not an issue in my using the internet.<br />I appreciate the value that I receive for free from Avast Antivirus.  Thanks!!
3,I wrote the whole deal on the review of the book that is supposed to make it ez.  I am sure if this is all I had to do for a month it would come to me!!
3,"The download was quick and simple, and the product installed easily.  I was able to upgrade the data from a previous version without any problem.  The download took a while because of its size, but went smoothly.  The product has a change in its interface but it's still easy to navigate.  I was up and running within an hour after the download completed.  So, it was simple with no problems and was up and running quickly.  That says it all."
1,"I have used HR Block software to save money vs. Turbo Tax for several years without issue.  This year I switched my brokerage to TD Ameritrade and now I find that the software won't import from TD Ameritrade.  It is one of the selections for import but it doesn't work.  TDAM says that the HR Block software \\""just doesn't get along\\"" with their system.<br />Since there is no way I am entering this by hand, and Amazon doesn't let you return downloaded software, I am out the money i bought this with and the extra I will have to pay for Turbo Tax.  Just adding a little joy to tax season.<br /><br />Update: After several more calls to several help desks and several waits I was able to locate someone who could tell me how to do this; hint: the software asks for a user name and password - you don't enter either your user name or your password to make the download work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I already bought the Turbo Tax and since it is having other difficulties maybe in the end I will have one working tax return.  It would be nice to get some standardization here, but I think - like our whole tax system - there is not enough money to be made in making it easy.<br /><br />I will go from one to two stars."
0,Poor business decision to strip away user ability to process investments from the Deluxe version.  This is way over priced and includes items most wont use but you are forced to get it for simple investment transactions.
3,"I have been a TurboTax user for years, and was bitten by the change in TT offerings.  I took advantage of the H&R Block free download for unhappy TT customers and decided to also investigate TaxACT.  I am glad I did.  I have a Mac, and thus had to use the online version, and found it easy to use.  The most irritating part was the failure of TaxACT to read my old tax returns; not a huge deal, just a bit more time consuming.  The interview format is slightly different to TT, and took a little getting used to, particularly when filling business expenses; I had to do my own calculations for business usage of home and vehicle.  Again, not a big issue, just something to be aware of.  I completed TaxACT, TT and H&R using the same information, with the following results:  TaxACT and TT were very similar; the only difference being the gain (loss) for sale of a vehicle.  I put TaxACT ahead of TT here as: a) the bottom line was better and; b) it was clear how TaxACT came up with its numbers (TT changed the depreciation on the vehicle for obscure reasons - I couldn't trace them back, which negatively affected the end result).  H&R fell out of the competition pretty quickly when I discovered a calculation error on business usage of a vehicle (the raw numbers were correct; the software failed to correctly divide one number by another).  As with any new software, it took a little time to get used to TaxACT.  Now that I've used it, I won't be using TT or H&R Block"
1,Turbo tax this year seems somewhat different than previous versions. I actually had an accountant look at my return and immediately found a big mistake. This is very concerning. It was about the placement of income for self-employment. I had a difficult time finding the schedule C and understanding things myself this year. It is likely I will not be returning to turbo tax next year.
1,"I had to update because of the usual Quicken 3 year rule.  I have used quicken for at least 9 years.  I loved the update from 2007 to 2010.  I don't like the 2013 version.  I thought the idea of the ability to use it on my phone would potentially be nice but you really can't do much in there.  Well perhaps my wife's Nexus 7?  It does have a little more functionality but it cannot sync investments which is what I would be looking at when sitting somewhere so not really useful. Like others I find the user interface on the PC less useful as well  - not much, but enought that I would consider it a downgrade.  The graininess of the graphics is my biggest complaint.  It almost feels like we just barely moved out of the DOS era.  ALSO like others, make sure you have backed up your old quicken file with a shorter password or you will have problems opening it in the new quicken."
4,great program
3,"Costly, but dependable. You save a lot of money buying it here at Amazon. I surf the web a lot and am prone to catching Trojans, Viruses, Spyware, etc.. This handles all of that really nice, just running in the background. I bought it because I was sick of the pop-ups and ads from the free Antivirus products out there. This is truly ad-free and they don't spam you or telemarket. I only gave it 4 stars because it seems to use a lot of system resources, but this may be a function I can correct in the settings. I will update this review later at the one year point. Reviews are an important part of the Amazon experience."
2,Easy to install and use and gets the job done.<br /><br />One gotcha...<br /><br />There is a lot of confusion over the extra $19 you have to pay to file your State return vie efile. It's not included with TurboTax.  The only workaround is to print a hard copy of your State return then mail it via the postal service. Of course that takes longer and you open up your personal financial data to it being lost or stolen on it's way there. To avoid that you have to pay an additional $19 to file it electronically. This is really fluff money for Intuit since transmission costs are pennies.
3,I have like Quicken for years.
2,"Avast would have received 5 stars except that you are shady about installing s*** that I do NOT want on my computer.  The latest update, with Dropbox, was NOT something that I wanted or requested.  If I want hassle, I'll use another anti-virus software.  You have been great for years, don't screw it up now!!!"
4,I use it on all my PC's.  It works great.  The price is right!  Will consider upgrading in the near future.
0,I was never able to get it to complete a full system backup. Tech support offered me no options other than to leave my computer on all day with full remote access enabled so they could get to it at their leisure. This was unacceptable - I would not leave my computer open without my direct supervision. There's a reason we have firewalls and passwords!
0,I'm trying to enter in my children and it won't let me do it! The program keeps<br />coming back with no.  So going over my answers I entered it to make sure I<br />didn't answer incorrectly it still says no.  So after the 4th time looking it<br />over with no changes and clicking back and forth it's finally says yes!<br /><br />So now I'm trying show that I took a early IRA distribution.  So I click<br />on the link and answer a few questions and it won't let me do it. Now<br />I'm stuck in a loop.<br /><br />Don't buy this!<br /><br />Here's an update:<br /><br />I just added 8K in income and it's still showing I owe<br />the same taxes before I added the income!  I even quit<br />the program and restarted it.  Still<br />not seeing my additional  income!<br /><br />This program must be broken or just really retarded.<br />Even laughable at this point!
4,Great program for photographers....makes you organize and process your pictures by batches and editing capability is superb. Great value for money....
4,There is little danger in allowing Turbo Tax to guide you. Just follow the prompts and you can't go wrong.I have two friends that work in the IRS and they tell me the IRS regards Turbo Tax as some of the best tax guidant software out there.
1,I was force into buying this version because my client use this. I dislike the new layout a lot.  The older version is much better.
2,"There is a glitch somewhere in the system because it asks me for my activation codes almost every time I click on it, even though I have already put in the code."
4,"We have been very satisfied with the Avast antivirus program.  Our previous antivirus program allowed many viruses to infiltrate our computer.  We took the computer to a specialist that cleaned it.  He was the one that recommended Avast, and it seems so much superior to other antivirus programs we have had in the past."
0,"I support Amazon they were nothing but great.<br />I no longer support Norton.<br />I had a couple of days left until the old one expired<br />It would not install current subscription<br />It just gave me same amount of days I had left.<br /><br />I winded up finding a deal with someone else<br />but it still was doing the same thing.<br />So when I was installing what ever it asked me about the proxy settings<br />I choose the opposite of the 1st install and that worked.<br /><br />Now I have to check of the box in tools, internet options, and connections LAN settings<br />Check off automatically detect proxy settings.<br /><br />There was an hour wait with the live chat.<br />I called the 800 number which takes a lot of digging to get to also had about an hour wait<br />And I never got through on either one."
3,It work as far as I know.
1,"Bit Defender was a great disappointment. Not because it's not a good product , which it may or may not be, but because Amazon version won't run under Windows 10.  True, Amazon never claimed it did but I figured that must be an oversight ... everone else already had a Win 10 version.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  Amazon's version does not run under Win 10 (they are now processing a refund) and I had to go with something else ... Kaspersky, in fact."
0,NortonFree down load.  I think its very nice to let us down loas free  . I;m sure if its a good product and easy to down load so we will buy at end of our free trial. Thank toy Carol Fite Well today I am not so happy they took it back off my computer WHY I have no idea. The product seemed to be working well an would have bought it but they removed it
2,"Now that I have seen this product first hand, yes, the instructor is very thorough, however, he only covers the basics and from what I have seen on other sites such as youtube, what is covered in this video isn`t anything that you can`t find simply by searching online."
2,"Microsoft Office is expensive, confusing and far from perfect. But who's kidding who? We all have to use it, and there's no way around it. It's nearly impossible to survive without Word, Excel and PowerPoint.<br /><br />I wish these programs were easier to use and not so expensive. But I've been making that wish since I was a little kid, and I never got my wish."
2,Some of the features don't work correctly. Seems pretty buggy.  Hard time downloading account transactions.
3,"I completed all my forms without too much of an issue. However, there was a very small measly income from my wife's line of work that made us have to fill out a business expense form. I was able to fill out the form, but Turbotax won't allow me to file taxes without an upgrade. What is the upgrade for exactly? It's not like its adding any functionality to the \\""premier\\"" version, and the upgrade cost is on par with the income of my wife's work. I understand when an upgrade is necessary for functionality, but in this case it doesn't seem to add any value or functionality to my taxes.    I've never used turbotax before and I only considered this for the amazon bonus. However, this is annoying enough for me to consider competing software next year. I've used H&R in the past without any issues.    UPDATE: Adding 2 stars- I just spoke with a turbotax representative and they allowed me to upgrade for no cost. I was impressed with how they handled my questions and fixed the issue without it being a bad experience."
0,"I purchased 2015 as an upgrade from 2012 because Quicken informed me that I would lose my connectivity for 2012.  The first thing I hated was the Intuit ID.  I don't want an intuit ID, I don't want to save anything in the cloud, I just want to open my file and use it but Quicken won't allow that.  Every time I open the file, I have to go through their advertisements and input the intuit ID in addition to my password.  Their cloud is just another hacker opportunity and I don't want any information in their cloud but they won't allow me to escape it.  Additionally, I have an account that won't properly download. 2015 wanted to reset the account so I let it.  Unfortunately, that meant it sat there spinning for 20 minutes telling me I had connectivity issues.  In reality, there was nothing wrong with my connectivity but there is no way to cancel the transaction since the cancel button is grayed out and my only option was to kill the program.  This is probably the worst software I have ever used and I have been a quicken user for many years.  I am looking at alternatives and will consider 2015 an expensive lesson in what not to buy"
3,"Very good, has a tendency to take over your computer and make it a little slower in response time when surfing the web"
0,"Unable to download and &#34;help&#34; section was of no help.  Tried to email Amazon but I did not have the correct email system, so I couldn't even request help."
3,"Great price, good product but the online download site, account setup by Microsoft was a bit tedious.  Guess I'm old school, like my discs to load sofware from."
3,I would have preferred a CD rather than the download as I did encounter problems and had to contact Norton for repair. Otherwise it appears to be working fine to this point.
0,"The product has only one transition, not several for variety.  No better than the free windows version. I tried to get my money back within 20min. of purchase, I never even got a response."
4,"This program is much better then I expected! It is fairly easy to use, has tons of options that allow you to edit/make a cover/letter with ease. Better then all the other programs I have tried!"
0,"This version of Quicken was supposed to work with the data versions from older Quicken programs.  Unfortunately, the process of adapting the old data files so they can be used with this version is cumbersome, replete with errors and excessively time consuming.<br /><br />I would happily exchange it for any version of Quicken that will work with the data files produced by my old Quicken 2000 software."
4,"Gives me a detailed overview of where I am financially on a daily basis. Automatic updates ensures that I know what my bank, credit and investment account balances are every log in. Budget planner is excellent to help me managed my debt."
2,When transfered the data brought in old forms that were printed with the return.  Deleted all and started again.  Time consuming.  Had trouble clearing up data errors.
1,"I have used Quicken for 15 years or more.  The version I downloaded is incredibly buggy.  It was so bad that I reverted to 2013.  There were double entries in my check register, some transactions showed transmitted to my bank but were not there and the program froze after an online update, just to mention a few of the problems.  I did work with Quicken support and was able to get a major patch that seems to have resolved my problems.  (I call it a major patch because my version was unusable without it.)  I cannot be sure until I have tested it more though.  In any event, it would be good if Amazon could make sure they have the very latest and less buggy version available for download.  I was close to giving up on QW 2014 and I still might if I run into other serious problems."
1,documents would not print.
3,"Love how quickly it installed!<br />Only problem I have is sometimes it freezes, or lags really badly. But other than that, it's great!"
1,"Don't buy it, not worth it.  I actually have uninstalled and am just down loading transactions from my bank into a spreadsheet."
0,"I have written to Senior Management as well as Support located in the United States. I had serious problems with Quicken in 2000 and Scott Cook, Quicken's founder, looked into it and acted. That is no longer true. I wrote to him and never heard back. A support staffer called back and told me that all of my issues were actually \\""design improvements\\"" When I pointed out that the design improvement either did not work, or did not reflect the real world I got no where.<br /><br />I am desperate for another product where you actually get value from a new release and new releases make the product more flexible and responsive instead of less. These guys released a buggy program and take the position that flaws are \\""design improvements\\"".<br /><br />Yes after using this product for almost 20 years I AM REALLY ANGRY.<br /><br />3/21/13 (Current Release R11)<br /><br />I have decided to be specific with my problems.<br /><br />1) You can not monitor a credit bill. If you have a credit balance on an account Quicken does not let you manage it as an ongoing bill. If arbitrarily converts a minus of a credit balance to a plus and creates a line item to make the transaction positive. This has NEVER been true in ALL the other versions of Quicken I have used since around 1995.<br /><br />2) The redesign of the mortgage function FORCES you to use the Categories that Quicken wants. This means that you have to either correct the transaction after you enter it, or reclassify all of your mortgage entries. The redesign also does not pass the mortgage interest amount correctly to the Tax Planning module.<br /><br />These two issues and the company's reaction, give evident of a company that does not care about their long time customers, and based upon my experience and the experience of other reviewers seem to be badly rewriting their coded to address what they see as a new market, mobile computing, without fully testing the old routines to make sure they work. They also seem to have neglectedany customer feedback. The support guy told me neither of these issues were actually problems.<br /><br />If you have to upgrade, like I had to, seriously see if there is a work around. If I knew then, what I know now, I would not have upgraded and not wasted the $60 or so dollars.<br /><br />BEWARE, BEWARE, BEWARE !!!!<br /><br />Release 12 (4/19/13)<br /><br />This release does not address the above issues. I also discovered that you can't use \\""tags\\"" with mortgage transactions. I have been using them for the last two years. I now have to go in a fix the mortgage transaction every time I pay the mortgage."
2,"Why bother?  OS X has the same functionality built in for free - screenshots of the desktop, any window, menu, or area plus timed screenshots and video recording - all part of the base operating system."
0,"After upgrading my MacBook, I couldn't transfer Office from the old computer to the new one. I was forced to buy another copy of Office. Apple gives away Pages and Keynote for free."
0,After entering all my info and ready to file I got a message saying I couldn't complete with the software and I needed to go to a professional. When I called H&R Block they said they would switch me to their on line &#34;Best of Both&#34; at no charge. I had to re-enter everything on that. At the end it told me I had to pay the difference ($54.80). This is the short version. I have spent many hours on this. I have done my own taxes for many years and never had this trouble. Should have used Turbo Tax.
3,works pretty good
2,Its a MS application on Mac and has a few differences. I really just needed this quickly for files I received to edit/comment. The purchase experience to buy and download went easy. The only problem with these Apps is that they have a memory leak and slowly your Mac starts to slow down if you keep running for days like I do. Just quit the App with Force and then restart. They need to fix this.
1,"Try to download to my netbook it took about 4 hours to download, after hat my computer said it had a virus and was deleted."
2,Better software than the rest although this particular one has too much ads
3,Having your raw footage and VFX in the same package makes me much more productive. Also their support is 2nd to none.
1,"This is definitely a case of getting what you pay for....and it was free.  I've not been a huge fan of open office since I've used mainly Microsoft Word, but I figured for what I need at home opposed to what I need at work, it would be fine.  My biggest complaint....well my only one but it's HUGE....when I copy and paste, the program throws an error at me saying the program crashed.....8 out of 10 times!  I am now saving my pennies to buy Microsoft office.  In the meantime, I will keep trying to use OpenOffice....thankfully most of what I am trying to save is in a PDF form!  It's the only thing saving my sanity!"
0,On word. A horrible app. doesnt even show up as a folder on a PC. Have to launch the application and select the folder to upload data.  Works fine on mobile devices but sucks on a PC. I pay extra for storage because I upload videos also but if they dont fix this soon I am going somewhere else.<br /><br />drop Box offers 1 TB for $9.99 a month which is less than what I paid amazon for a 200GB storage.<br /><br />Amazon please fix this if you are reading this
1,"So far, it's screwed up two of my credit card accounts by changing my log-in code, and messed up my investment account because it won't handle my option trades, properly."
3,"We appreciate how user friendly the program is to use however, we can never get all pages of return to print this is frustrating."
1,"Not user friendly, limited print options,"
3,Works great thank you
4,Easy install. Great all around product. If you already have a Norton account registered you can see the upgrade instantly
2,"But all of the security systems are about the same, something at some time will make its way through and cause a problem."
2,It is OK.. Has a fancy interface and does what it says. Problem is it does nothing special and insists on running all the time wasting system resources.
4,"AVAST WORKS GREAT, I LOVE THAT THEY GIVE YOU THE OPTION OF STAY FREE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO UPGRADE"
2,"I decided to upgrade my 2013 version as I generally like newer versions of software and figured I'd see some nice changes. My initial reaction is...there's not too much different and in some cases it's worse. Maybe I'm not seeing the improvements because I don't use the more advanced functionality of the software, but visually it's 95% the same as 2013 which is ok, but I was hoping to see some visual design changes as it's starting to look very outdated. Some things that annoy me are:<br /><br />1. I set the memorized payee list to remove payees after 18 months of inactivity, and Quicken NEVER removes them. As I had some free time I decided to clean the list myself and removed a ton of payees from 3+ years ago. Why offer this functionality if it doesn't work? I'd love to hear from someone that it works for.<br /><br />2. Attaching files to register entries has taken a turn for the worse. I'm annoyed that I can't add an attachment from the Bills tab when I record a bill payment (I was hoping that they were going to fix this). Instead, I have to record the bill and then go into my checking account register to add the file there. Why? Also, in Quicken 2013 if you click the paper clip after uploading the file the attachment used to immediately open. Now, when you click the paper clip you get a smaller window showing the generic PDF file icon and you have to then click on that icon to open the file. Really? This is a downgrade from 2013.<br /><br />3. The Preferences menu is an utter mess......it's stuck in the stone ages and they need to make it more intuitive.<br /><br />In hindsight, I should have just kept 2013 as there's nothing different that is making me excited about this version. If you have 2013 I recommend sticking with it. If you've never used Quicken before this is ok to purchase as I haven't seen anything better (aside from Microsoft Money, but that is long gone).<br /><br />Oh, one positive is that every three months you can receive your credit score fromEquifax so that's nice, but it's not worth upgrading just for that."
1,"Quicken forces you to buy new software after a set number of years, they will turn off your online access unless you update. They used to be a great company that offered worthwhile improvements with each new version, now they sell the same thing in a new wrapper. I have been a user from the early Windows versions from over ten years ago. They basically dump on their customers as they are the only game in town. Bring back Microsoft Money or any reasonable competitor and it would be adios, muchachos, to Quicken"
0,Biggest waste of money. Product is garbage! I bought this to create DVDs for my sons all star team for end of year party. Spent few hours building DVD only to burn it and then load it on DVD player ...the buttons don't work and you can even play the thing. I had started this Thursday and I had to get DVD done by the party on Sunday and I tried to contact their customer support but had to wait 48 hours to get an email response which I got a response 3 days later today Monday... and that was utterly useless support reply. I am a network engineer and very tech savvy. I found a different program by Coral DVD Movie Factory Pro 7 which was fantastic and worked fine with no problems. I asked for a refund and was told I could not get one but I could get a similar crap product for same value instead.
4,"Download of product was without trouble. Product works as advertised. However, consumers should be notified that In order to install a new anti virus product you must first uninstall the old one. A link to that uninstall program on the sellers site would be a big help."
4,Switched to this tax software years ago and it always does the job.
2,Not a significant upgrade from the Quicken H&B 2012 that it replaced.  Was disappointed that it is not compatible with my Windows Surface and that the&#34;receipts&#34; option is klunky.
4,"I was looking for a video program that would let me reverse video and not cost a fortune, Power Director fit the bill."
1,"I've used Microsoft Money successfully for years but with the purchase of a new laptop I could no longer use \\""Money\\"".  I purchased Quicken 2013 and, when installing, was unable to do the recommended updates.  I was reminded again the next time I opened it, tried to update, and still can't.  In Money I had three different accounts listed in one section.  It appeared the only way I could do it was to use the automatic download.  {Uncle Sam requires separated info on medical bills so auto downloads would not be specific enough.]  I emailed for help twice and the info helped - some.  I Finally figured out that I should have used the \\""Cash\\"" selection instead of the Bank Name selection when creeating a new account.  I was not told this by the help desk.  So simple - once I realized how to do it.  No instruction book to help with anything.  Highly experienced computer users might know and realize this;  at 68, I'm definitely NOT extremely proficient in computers - or Quicken!"
3,Great program and even better with the Ancestry subscription. However I havem't found how to do maps to show migration or all places.
4,Finally got my 2003 version updated to this 2013.  Lots of new and interesting additions to the program.  Worth the buy.
0,I agree this product is practically useless for my purposes to edit and crop files.  Go go to Corel free trial and decide for yourself before buying.
1,Not sure what the purpose of this version of Quicken.  It seems Intuit needed to just have a change ... it's just not a functional or useful one.
1,it is no bad
4,Really nice Anti Virus!<br /><br />Well developed software. It is very user friendly and works better than every other antivirus programs I have used before.
0,"I've been a Quicken user since 1990 and have been using the budget feature for many years.  I purchased Quicken 2013 in the hope that it would fix some of the bugs I was experiencing (some lost transactions).  Unfortunately, I still see some of those bugs and worse, budget reports that used to work fine in Quicken 2011 are now missing the Group subtotals that I depended on for completing my budget summaries.  I would like to save my Quicken file in 2011 format so I can return to the previous version but I don't believe I can do that.  Stay away from this version if you use the budgeting feature."
1,"Turbotax has gone to junk. Good product going down the tubes! Next year, I will try one of their competitors instead."
2,"Stayed loyal to Quicken Essentials until forced to convert to Quicken 2015 for Mac and pay for the privilege--yet, familiarity is a parent of loyalty.  Although it took some time to find where things were in the new format, moving to Quicken 2015 for Mac was easy.  To the layman, the changes seem more cosmetic than revolutionary.  While I've tried other financial programs, I stay with Quicken's &#34;adequate-for-my-needs&#34; approach.<br />+ It serves me well for tracking financial accounts, bills and spending.<br />- The Budget feature is limited and doesn't serve me well.<br />+ At tax time, it's useful for gathering, summarizing and preparing for tax filings."
0,"I am seeing all of these reviews and majority of the people says that this software is absolutely bad news. Until I see proof that it is not, 1 star."
1,"I am very disappointed in Amazon. I was planning to make this my primary cloud storage because of the unlimited capacity. However, I did the 3 month free trial and now notice that the sync application no longer works and the have this new garbage. You have 90 days to fix this or I will not be paying to keep unlimited storage or my music storage. Ill keep my Prime free photo storage and keep using Google Drive and One Drive. They may offer less space but at least they mount a drive and sync it!"
2,"Slower to run than 2013, update function needs work (just gives you a blank screen), you don't know when it finishes updating."
0,"I have used the H&R Block TaxCut software since 2007 but always from a CD provided via post mail. This year I decided to purchase a download through Amazon. After completing my federal return I have been trying to e-file. Software tells me I must update. I've ran the update 10X+ and it keeps telling met to update. I went to the support forum at hrblock.com and downloaded the update manually to my computer. Followed the recomendation to have no external drives attached to the computer, have all windows updates in place, turn off firewall and also run the update as administrator. I went a step further and rant he tax software as admin, tried to run the update from there. All of these scenarios are not working. The program thinks it needs an update. Wont' let me efile, can't add a state until these are complete. After countless hours trying to get this done I am giving up and looking for an alternative way to complete my taxes and efile. Hopefully a competitor will allow me to import the block tax file I've already created."
0,"I've used taxAct, turbo tax and now H&R block tax software.  H&R block is by far the least intuitive to use.  I waited 2 hrs for someone to tell me all I had to do was review a single yellow box on a questionable part of my return.  There were no directions for what to do when I was directed to re-check part of my information.  All they had to do was say it. As in &#34;please check if the information found inside any yellow-marked box is correct.&#34;  This wasn't obvious to me what they wanted me to do.  Also I totally missed one income question and was directed to file, but knew a big chunk of income was missing.  I had to go and hunt down where to put the information.  It was buried within a long list of more obscure income generating things.  Other software packages are better at walking you through and alerting you to what kind of income each section is about. Furthermore, the cost of the state returns is expensive.  After the free state, every other state is $60, first for the $40 software, then the $19.99 filing fee.  So if you are one person, with one state, it may be fine.  But if you have multiple state returns, or multiple family members using the software, it adds up.  It is also the most restrictive software for free state filing,.  For some reason, H&R block decided not only must your income be below a certain amount, you also have to be 53 years old and under for the free e-filing.  How is that NOT age discrimination?  Anyway, for those multiple reasons, I won't be using H&R block again.  TaxAct seemed easier to me."
0,i have no idea how to work it
4,"same as last year. easy to order, download, update, use. have not filed yet and did have trouble with that last year as an overseas filer with majority of income falling under foreign earned income exemption. maybe better luck this year."
4,"Tried to go with a competitor, it couldn't handle my situation with respect to health care insurance.  After waiting for weeks to get my issue resolved with the competitor, switched back to TurboTax, which it handled it smoothly."
2,"Would rate higher if TurboTax didn't remove functionality/features they now have in the deluxe version which is overrated in price. Because it was a download (which was good) and it imports all of my financials, I gave it a 3."
2,"I appreciate my accounts syncing to my iPhone 6 - along with the free Mobile App that works with the Desktop version. There are some quirkiness when updating my credit card / debit card accounts. For example, I get error messages alluding to syncing or not being able to connect to a certain bank. The issue is not necessarily with Quicken but the banks themselves as they implement security measures such as typing a captcha code periodically. I appreciate the security but it does detract from the seamlessness of updating my accounts. Another quirk is when I do manually input a record, for example, and I download the latest transactions, about half the time they don't match or reconcile properly. Overall, the idea is there, the implementation is not. Hence the 3 star rating."
4,"It only works to upgrade Word Perfect X6 if you already have X5 or X4.<br /><br />Sadly I only had X3 so was out of luck. However a sharp eyed Amazon Customer Service person who I explained I couldn't afford $300 for a brand new WP, spotted a excellent new Standard X6 version. He helped me buy that, refunding my first attempt to move into better software, and it worked out swell.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon<br />Claudia Strasbaugh"
0,"Hangs and crashes. Problems with bank account downloads. Real pita to change from a good working version to a new one with bugs, but what ya going to do, you must &#34;upgrade&#34; every 3 years ... but $16.67/yr is acceptable I guess."
3,"I've been using an integrated home finance software package for decades, and so my uses and needs have essentially &#34;matured&#34; in parallel with these packages.  I started with Microsoft Money and transitioned to Quicken when MS pulled the plug on its Money product.  Make all the fun you want of Microsoft, but at the time Money had probably about 80% of Quicken's functions and features, but 500% of the usability.  IMHO there is nothing like Quicken on the market.  Whether package software or web-based, everything else pales by comparison in terms of the breadth and depth of functionality.  Depending on your current requirements, there may be a better, faster, and cheaper approach for managing your finances.  But should you live long and prosper and seek an integrated approach for managing your wealth, eventually your requirements will demand something like Quicken.  So here's why I gave Quicken 4 vs. 5 stars.  The user interface is inefficient and difficult to learn.  If Quicken had some competition, maybe they'd spend a few bucks on improving the user interface.  But statements about user interfaces are for the most part subjective.  So here's an objective statement -- even &#34;Release 5&#34; (most current as of 3/28/2015) is somewhat unstable.  I've never lost any data, but it's really annoying that a program that has been around as long as Quicken crashes more than once in a blue moon."
3,"Update: stopped working on my windows 7, and auto fixed could not fix it either still is working on my windows 8"
0,"I have had only problems since going to quickbooks 2012.  The only reason I upgraded from 2007 is they cut me off from email and creditcard services unless you upgraded.  Tech support is not very knowledgeable, I have spent over 15 Hours of my valuable time this month with them on the phone.  Find another software program, save yourself the headaches."
4,excellent
0,"Very slow data entry response times make this upgrade not only disappointing but unusable. After long frustrating calls to support desk, we returned the software and reverted to Quicken Essentials"
2,"Read the &#34;fine print.&#34; Buried in the product description (in grey type, no less) is the revelation that e-filing state will cost &#34;an additional charge,&#34; which turns out to be $19.95. Other than that bit of bait-and-switch, everything is okay. The software worked as intended with Windows 8."
1,I filed MN (non-resident) first and WI resident. I received notice from WI Dept of Revenue that they didn't receive supplemental form OS (credit for income tax paid to other states.) I had to submit manually.  Wondering why I purchased the WI state form and pail the efiling fee.
4,It is a amazing product and I just love it. Easy to use and very useful. Must have for anyone.
3,"Tried numerous Anti Virus software over the years and they either are resourse hogs, interfere with other applications, numerous false positives and worst of all it would take special instructions and time to remove it from your system.<br />Avast! finally came around, used the free software for a year and found that it did a very good job for what it was intended. I have had the purchased bundle for over 6 years with only one complaint. They resently changed their interface and it is not as user friendly as it was."
4,downloaded less than 5 minutes and up and running.  Best product yet.  would recommend to friends and amazon shoppers.  love it.
4,"Really helpful for a person like me,  helped me out so many times."
2,"Not super user friendly.  The Help section is less than helpful.  I think overall, TurboTax is better for DIY."
0,I think this put a virus on my laptop 💻
3,This has been an easy upgrade.  I have used QB for a long time and rally like it
0,"I am disappointed in it because the process to balance accts to bank statements does not exist.  Also auto payments keep popping up each time you enter something with that date, even after having noted the acct it is attached to and even when you have put in another payee name.       Microsoft Money was much more easily used and within minutes accts could be balanced and expense reports ready to show where the $$ went."
1,Don't believe the free fed and State e-filing claim.  Not very upfront with what you need to purchase to get this.  I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I believe this will be my last.
3,This is a good app.
1,"One of the most useful reports in checking the accuracy of the return, the two-year summary (this year verus last year) is gone!  I've used this program for the past 8 years, but I will probably switch to Turbotax next year if this form is not put back into the product.  Very frustating."
3,I like it pretty well. Many others out there.
2,Wonderful product
2,"Good product, but requires a lot of reading"
3,Possibly the best Free tax software available. Similar to other brands without the high price.
2,"Debut is okay, but it's lacking a lot of the great tools that Manga Studio EX has. I'd say it'd be worth it to buy just EX. I thought I'd try out the program with Debut, but I ended up buying EX for a lot of the better features. Like the Perspective rules, 3D help stuff, mesh thing that allows you to warp a tone pattern like  it were legitimately on fabric."
1,"I'm a long time user and fan of Quicken.  I get a new version every 3 years because of their requirement to get a new version to keep the downloads active.  This version adds no significant features that I found useful.  It crashes from time-to-time, not enough to make it unusable but enough to make it annoying.  The revised feature to allow some accounts to be treated separately works but is very clumsily implemented.  If you're converting from an earlier version, I would suggest waiting until the errors are corrected."
3,With a very tight budget having the ability to use a free product that never causes glitches and crashes but protects from the newest viruses is a joy for me.  Thank you Avast!
4,Avast has always caught the virus. Ha They continue to catch all the bad ones now if they could help me from catching the cold or flu virus that would be a true blessing
4,I have used Turbo Tax for several years and find it very easy to use.
1,"Difficult (or impossible) to upgrade existing installations.Lost several days on each system installed. Symantic wants to sell the upgrades at close to full price, not honor this kind of purchase.<br />Should be labeled as &#34;Not for Upgrade, Update of existing licenses&#34;, or clear instructions provided."
0,did not owrk on mycomputer. asked my it guy t look and he coulsn't figure out why it did not preform.
4,"Used TurboTax for years and it makes doing my taxes SOOOO much easier! Using the &#34;Its Deductible&#34; section for my material donations to Goodwill is super easy, too."
4,I keep books for two businesses with Quickbooks Pro.  It works great for me.
1,"Well, I've used Quicken for many years and this Deluxe 2014 version is the worst by far.  I was using the 2011 version and it worked pretty well, but when I was forced to migrate to the 2014 version what a decline in performance I'm experiencing.<br /><br />For some unknown reason Quicken has designed this 2014 version to have to communicate on-line with the Intuit's Cloud on each transaction and therefore the performance is very, very, very slow.  After each entry or transaction you wait for the entire page to be refreshed, with other delays of course, and finally you can execute your next step.  VERY slow and completely unnecessary as I don't use any functions provided by the Quicken Cloud anyway.<br /><br />The only not-unfavorable thing I can say about it is that it's pretty cheap...and that's it!"
2,"Helps do your taxes, although I wish they provided a multi state version. My taxes require at least 3 states."
0,"Intuit is one of very, very few software companies who release almost annual &#34;updates&#34; for which it charges current users almost the full purchase price (or discounted sale price) of a new release.  Sometimes, Intuit gets way with this practice because the previous version is not upgraded to Apple's newest OS.  Every time I upgrade (buy a new full version) of QuickBooks I feel cheated.  The value received for the price makes me feel &#34;ripped off.&#34;<br /><br />There is something not quite right about this practice, but QuickBooks continues to get away with it and will do so until another firm develops small business accounting packages at a reasonable price.  Developers should take note ... and it would be great if a competitor to QuickBooks were able to input QuickBooks data.  Until then ... or until Intuit develops a true &#34;update&#34; strategy as opposed to selling new releases to existing customers ... I'm forced to purchase.  But, as you can tell, I don't feel good about it."
3,i have used norton since ive purchased this computer.i havent had any problems so therefor i figure that its doing its job. the price was right and the installation went smoothly. and during the year norton has updates for free.good all around deal.
1,"I was told I had to upgrade to the Quicken 2013 because it would not work for online downloading, etc. after April (I believe).  So I spent the money to get Quicken 2013 even though I was very happy with my Quicken 2010.  Every few years I am forced to do this.  I am a retired senior with limited income so it makes me mad to have to spend money where I don't think it is necessary.  I have had quite a few problems with this version.  I have never had problems before.  You should never have put this product on the market."
2,"Does the job of keeping your income and expenses which is useful at the end of the year for tax purposes, however I was disappointed I couldn't enter a revised budget."
2,The software would just not install in Windows 7. I had long conversation with Turbotax personnel who tried to help me with different versions of the software. But nothing worked. Ultimately tried to install the same in Windows 8 and it was flawless.
2,I like it
0,I downloaded this POS 5 times but the damn thing won't install - it keeps giving an error message and won't complete the installation. Don't waste your f.ing time with this stupid thing! I have just wasted a precious hour trying to make this happen!
3,"1st time H&R Block user after 20+years w/TurboTax.  Wasn't buying TT's excuse for jacking up the price & moving key features to more expensive package so I switched.  Completely satisfied with H&R Block; no problem importing last year's TT returns, interviews simple to follow."
2,I don't use the full power of this Quicken.  It is great for keeping track of expenditures and checks.
1,i cant tell the difference between this and the 2011 version of the software.
3,"I wish they would give you a translation of what you're saying/reading.  I just have to guess at the answers to most of their questions.  But I suppose that is a decent (and probably more effective) way to learn.  It's really hard, but it works."
1,"In my small business, I've been depending on SecureAnywhere Complete for several years, and I'm marginally satisfied at best.  I know that it has saved me from malware intrusions many times because it pops up a dramatic warning when that happens.  On the other hand, about once every other week, when I come into my office in the morning, SecureAnywhere tells me that something called the &#34;Morto Trojan&#34; has appeared on my hard drive.  SecureAnywhere seems to clean up that infection without letting it do any damage, but nevertheless, it allows the same malware to reappear again and again.  The more serious deficiency of SecureAnywhere is, however, its automatic cloud backup feature.  To begin with, setting up a backup schedule is infuriatingly counter-intuitive.  Then it's very hard to determine if the backups are working as intended.  (For example, in Internet Explorer, SecureAnywhere's yellow dot on a file name can mean &#34;This file is not yet backed up,&#34; but it can also mean &#34;This file is backed up identically from more than one folder.&#34;  When my hard disk crashed, and I went to restore my files from the cloud, I found that SecureAnywhere had stopped making backups of my Outlook folders several months earlier, and I had lost everything from the intervening weeks.  I'm motivated to write this review today because I just checked the backups of my Outlook folders to ensure that they're okay, and I found that SecureAnywhere has again cancelled my daily scheduled backup without notifying me.  I'm going to have to look at other security packages.  ADDENDUM:  As soon as Amazon published this review of SecureAnywhere, the manufacturer commented on it and invited me to contact Webroot support for help in resolving my problems.  The support team did respond promptly, and they did resolve my immediate problem.  After that, however, I asked how I can ensure that SecureAnywhere doesn't turn off my backups again without notifying me.  In response, the Webrootsupport team told me how to check the activity log to determine if SecureAnywhere is in fact working.  They summarized their recommendations as follows:  &#34;Each back up [sic] software has different strengths and weaknesses, and most require the user interaction [sic] to ensure that they are working correctly.&#34;  I'll let that reply speak for itself.  ADDENDUM 2:  A year later, I still have to check SecureAnywhere every morning to see if it has backed up my new files overnight.  It's not at all unusual for me to find that it has NOT.  Whenever I see that my new files are unprotected, the &#34;Backup & Sync&#34; tab of the SecureAnywhere control panel  shows that Backup and Sync are both inexplicably turned OFF.  Rebooting the computer seems to resolve the problem — until it happens again, usually within about a week.  The anti-malware features of SecureAnywhere have been effective, but this HUGE flaw in the backup feature is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.  ADDENDUM 3:  I give up.  Every morning, SecureAnywhere reports that it ran my backups as scheduled during the night, but when I look at the backup copies that are available for restoration from the cloud, they're often two weeks out of date.  A support person instructed me to uninstall and reinstall SecureAnywhere, which did get the backups working again for a few days until everything returned to what is apparently NORMAL —  confident but completely false assurances.  On my most recent call, the support person told me that SecureAnywhere is an anti-virus package, not a backup package, and I would probably be happier with dedicated backup software.  I thanked him for an honest answer."
1,"I bought this just for the mobile device sync capability.  Come to find out, Quicken will not sync all of my accounts.  I specifically need to be able to sync accounts in foreign currencies.  I sincerely hope that Quicken will enable this functionality in a future update but I'm not holding my breath.  A little bit disappointed..."
3,Purchase Quicken 2014 to replace my earlier 2013 version. Negative:  Can no longer produce individual reports on accounts.  It aggregates all accounts into the summary.  No work around available
4,I do not know how to type at all.and now i am up to 13 words per minute.
2,"Intuit tried to pull a fast one this year and stripped out some features and forms from Deluxe, they gave you a free upgrade if you called them on it, but why be so shady to begin with?"
2,"Program locks up constantly, not sure why, but needs to be updated. Also program does not default to current date automatically."
3,"I just purchased and downloaded the Mac version of Turbotax. It downloaded instantly and in a few swipes and clicks, it was installed. Updating was just as easy and took a few minutes. Just opened it up and it found my 2010 returns and I'm ready to go. I've been using Turbotax for years and never had any problems, although it does help to know in general what you're doing as I've caught little blips here and there that required overrides. This doesn't occur very often and is usually due to a unique situation. Enjoy...as much as you can considering the subject matter."
1,"I almost purchased this yesterday for my Wife's Windows 8 touch screen laptop while looking for a MS Office home/student edition.  I had not heard of Office 365, and they had a seemingly good deal for a Military appreciation version ($69.00!).  I figured I'd look at the feedback, as I was concerned that it required an annual subscription.  The five PC was tempting, but all my PCs are Vista home Premium, which is not listed as compatible...IF this is they way MS is going, I'm probably done with MS Office and will stick with OpenOffice which will read and save in MS format...AND IS FREE!"
1,"I've been using iBank for a few years now and was waiting for this upgrade hoping to sort some things out.<br />This latest upgrade to 5 is in my opinion so bad, I am considering going back to the 4. I would go to another product if there was a better one for Mac... Try all of them every other year.<br /><br />Here are some of the more annoying problems (all of them would take too long):<br />- This thing DOES change the transaction's number when importing and sets the same as the first one that became import rule. There's no way of going around this. I cannot turn that off if I want to do it manually. It's freekin' maddening. I deleted all templates but it keeps adding them automatically. That's a deal breaker. I cannot trust software that changes things on my bank reports. Now I have to go back and verify every transaction with a number.<br />- Every time you change Category manually and press \\""Enter\\"" it keeps asking if I want to create a rule and to answer you have to leave the keyboard and point the mouse at the NO button. Every time! And no matter what your answer is it still creates both import rule and a Template and assigned them automatically on the next import.<br />- It never learned to distinguish between (incl. the previous version) different regular amounts to the same payee and would put them always in the same category.<br />- Still does not import properly transactions with two-lined description, like my bank does it, part of it goes to the Notes field and I cannot use it for, well - notes.<br />- when adding a new transaction there's no deposit field, just withdraw, have to enter number with \\""-\\"" to get it.<br />- The new design is horrible - bland and colourless - why? Because Apple doesn't like colour any more? I do.;<br />- Cannot export for Excel;<br />- Reports - when creating a new one still cannot un-select all accounts and have to un-check them one by one like an idiot, (come on guys, that's ridiculous!);<br />- The new \\""New transaction\\"" banner is so big, it covers most of the category picture so you cannot see it;<br />- The Budgets are useless, as before, I do them on Excel;<br />- A, and the mobile version has not changed for maaany years and is basically useless for anything but occasional reference.<br /><br />On the Plus side (not much, but worth mentioning):<br />- Good, nice looking, Click-able Reports, that's why I'm still using it. You can go down to transaction level through the report, change something and save it. That's great and not so many of the optional software has it;<br />- Can Attach files to a transaction - important for me, use it often (couldn't figure out how to do it in the beginning, needs to be added to the drop-down menu);<br />- Has pictures for the Categories, so I can easily distinguish transactions when I'm looking for something;<br />- Split transactions and sub-categories - those are a must for any financial software;<br />- Synch with the mobile version is good and fast.<br /><br />Recommendations: I wouldn't bother, there's nobody listening out there..."
0,"Purchased this to use on my MacBook Pro , couldn't download it, followed link to Norton, that didn't work either, but Amazon refunded my money.  I don't recommend this software download."
0,"When you pay good money for this product you are given a code to unlock the software. When I typed in the code I was informed that my code was invalid. I tried a second and third time. same result. I emailed Kaspersky  but since the product was not purchased from them directly they would not help. I will be purchasing a disc from one of the local retailers and NEVER AGAIN PURCHASE A KASPERSKY PRODUCT. I'll also never download ANYTHING OFF OF AMAZON AGAIN. They got my money and i got nothing. Well almost nothing. The download did give me a 30 day &#34;free&#34; trial. Since this fine &#34;free&#34; trial program opened up in my system the computer has been sluggish with lots of hesitations, a fine thing to have if you like to watch videos."
1,The description was not helpful to me and it ended up not being the product I needed. It is just the smart book and does not include connect. There is no refund for digital products so I just wasted $115.
4,This product is by far the best I have used and I have tried 3 other very popular brands that are on the market.
0,"After signing up with email, verifying email, setting password, Microsoft says that my email and password are invalid.  There is no way to fix this.  I cannot download the software on any computer or other device.  All they do is give you a graphic image to copy, but even that does not work.  Unable to call or email Microsoft.  They are horrible people to do business with.  So sorry that Amazon got trapped in this.  Believe me, I am very capable of knowing my email and password for this situation.  As usual, their Customer Support and Customer Service is inaccessible and/or non existent.  Even Amazon reps were unable to contact Microsoft with their &#34;special&#34; access telephone numbers.  Waste of time.  Thanks for trying Amazon.  I hope this eventually gets fixed."
4,I would recommend Avast Free Antivirus to any pc user.  It has been protecting my computers for over a decade.  The thing I like most about Avast is it updates itself and stops any malicious websites from running anything when the website is hacked with malicious software and you don't know it.
2,it did what it was suposed to do but know i can't print a copy for my records. this sucks.
3,"I've used TaxCut for more than 10 years and have always found it to be more than adequate for our joint return and my son's return.  I have no reason to believe that this year's edition will be any less useful.  However, when you factor in the cost of e-filing 2 Massachusetts state returns [...] on top of the cost for the program [...]  the total seems a bit steep even for the convenience.  This year, the IRS is offering FREE efiling for ANYONE, if your return is not overly complicated and includes only the forms included in the program.  [...] Some states may also offer free efiling services, so it may now make sense to save the [...] (or more) and do it for free - you may not get all the bells and whistles but frankly I've never used them much in the past and my situation hasn't changed much from recent years.  Something for those of you concerned with the costs of this program (an TurboTax) to consider ..."
2,"The product itself seems to work.  I cannot figure out how to use the add-on Grimefighter, though.  There does not seem to be any button or link to that that I can find."
1,"There is a steep learning curve to this one.  Unless you are an architect, you probably won't care enough to stick with it.  I was just remodeling a house.  I went to pen and paper after a few days mucking with the floor plans on this thing.<br /><br />I've read it is very powerful, but for a one time use (more or less), it's not worth the time investment."
2,"Not happy that they took out the section for reporting withdrawl's from stocks. I had to pay an extra $30 just for that one item, shame on you Turbotax"
3,"I run Avast Internet security on all my computers and my cell phone. I changed to Avast after a major brand of anti-virus allowed two viruses to infect my PC.<br /><br />I decided that a second pair of eyes, so to speak, wouldn't hurt. Getting a Lifetime license on this product looked like a good deal.<br /><br />You can never really know if something is working until maybe a lot of people get hit with something and you don't. But remember that no product will protect you if you don't follow good safe-computing practices."
2,"I have used Turbotax for several years for my personal return, and I am an accountant, so I feel like there will be many other people who come to the same conclusion that I did this year.  Because the IRS had not completed some of the instructions and forms, the technicians that program features into the software were delayed in completing the package, yet they went ahead and sold it to the public before everything was up to date.  It has been annoying to get to a place in the input and find that you have to wait for some updates before you can go forward with your return.  I finished 1 return for a friend, and there was difficulty in e-filing and I had to contact my computer guru to help me go through the e-file step by step.  The instructions on each step were totally greek to me, and with his help, we finally got her return done.  Hers is a very siimple return.  Mine, not so much.  I'm waiting a little longer before I put some things into my return because I know there are problems in it.  I'm usually filed and through by the end of February, but I will be happy with the end of March this year."
3,good program
0,"I hate it, please send me a refund ASAP. Thank you.<br /><br />Dr Robert W Eckles"
3,"Complex editing of a pdf with Power PDF Standard requires saving the file as a Word document, etc., modify this saved document, and convert the saved document to a PDF.<br /><br />I prefer to easily edit the document as a PDF.<br /><br />Delete and Insert of pages can be done in Power PDF Standard for a PDF."
4,"I am a photographer who uses Lightroom all the time along with Adobe CS6. I was using a previous version of Lightroom, version 3.2 and I must say, there were so many amazing upgrades in this version.<br /><br />It has taken some getting used to, but I am loving it! Lightroom is such a valuable tool for the professional photographer."
2,"For my purposes, it does not do much more than the deluxe,which I purchased a couple of years ago! It updates automatically."
0,"Well, I thought everything was great until I tried to e-file using their State program. Federal return was accepted but State (built automatically from Federal data by program) was rejected 3 TIMES. Could not &#34;correct&#34;. After reaching ESCALATION department at HR Block was informed that the issue was a KNOWN &#34;formatting&#34; problem without a correction. Early filers were required to allow HR Block to submit manually on their behalf. However, as it was now close to deadline, that was no longer an option.<br /><br />I was told I had NO CHOICE but to manually assemble and mail my return!<br /><br />I will NEVER use this product (or anything I can avoid from HR Block) again!<br /><br />Good riddance!"
4,"Thanks to QuickBooks, our business runs much smoother."
2,"My advice to microsoft/amazon: provide better, more clear, accurate instructions when it comes to using this product. You should not be listing &#34;input activation code&#34; anywhere on the page that sells this product because YOU DO NOT supply the buyer with an activation code. Luckily, I found a review that was not only berating the seller for their incompetency, but also enabled me to successfully download and activate the product via some sound advice.<br /><br />Do all you are told to do when it comes to &#34;continuing to the office website&#34; and &#34;setting up office account&#34; and download the Microsoft Downloader to your computer. Then when it asks how you want to activate your product, choose the middle option, it should say something relating to logging in with an already created microsoft office account. Use the account you set up and--at least for me at this moment in time-- everything worked well. I now have office."
2,"Disappointed that I didn't purchase the state at the same time, BUT when I tried to buy the state within the program it kept shutting down due to unknown causes.  I had to do the state by hand."
2,"Been a Quicken user since the first version. Usually get the Deluxe version. I upgrade every few years. My last version was Quicken 2012, so I figured 2014 would be worth a shot. No change at all in the way it looks. Unless you check you would never know it was a new version. And so far I have found no amazing features or something that makes it a worthwhile upgrade. The only thing I can say is I am glad I got it on Amazon and didn't pay full price!"
1,the subscription model is a royal pain.  I did not need an upgrade other than Quicken decided to stop talking to by Bank and thus a new upgrade.
3,I downloaded a new Norton. I wouldn't have it any other way. Now the is a pestering onslaught of ad asking me to buy other versions ~ I wish they would STOP. I understand marketing. What I do not appreciate is the endless ongoing drive for me to upgrade my now defunct previous version. STOP
4,my old Norton expired purchased downloaded and was ready to go. No issue and it works for all three PC's
4,I have used Turbo Tax for years. Great tax prep software.
4,"Always recommend turbotax no issues, very seamless and works well. I paid one year for H&R block to do my taxes, I feel that my return was less or equal to all the times I have tried turbo tax. I believe that turbotax will get you what you want!"
4,Great delivery. Just purchase and downloaded it. never had bought before digital media from Amazon. I thought it was going to be an issue. to the contrary. Simple. fast. reliable. good price
0,Couldn't make it work for us.  Had to take ours to a professional.  Will go back to turbo tax in the future.
2,2012 was a more people friendly version!
4,It meets all my expectations
3,Quick and easy but if you want to get more complicated you can without bouncing in and out programs.<br />only problem I had was trying to import pictures can be confusing .
0,They want you to pay an additional sum of money for lightworks in this particular version of TC. A rendering engine that was included with all previous versions that i'm aware of. 1 star since this seems more like a downgrade than an upgrade from v21
3,Can't get it to work on my I-Pad though.  Any hints?
2,"I was required to have Microsoft Office for my work.  Since I work at home I was force to find a download of the program.  It's fine, it's Office.  There are other free resources available that work just as good (maybe even better) than a Microsoft product, but for my purposes it works fine."
3,"I am new to video editing and at first it took my some time to learn PowerDirector 11 Ultra.  After using it for a week or so, I like it.  It is fairly easy to use, with the exception of a few confusing transition default features.  My son who has been working video editing on a Mac says its a lot like iMovie.  I've been creating MP4 videos with music from short videos and JPEG pictures for my son's baseball tea.  It seems to render movies quickly and uploading to youtube is fast and easy as well."
0,"Beware, they promise you flexibility , many different options of subscrition. They try to insureyou  that you can cancel subscription at any time but true is you have to pay for full year. Support is terrible, hard to contact. Better think abuot  software on CD one time paid."
3,use it to read office docs works great
4,As usual TT worked smoothly.  No.issues.
1,I found that the downloaded software would not allow me to download my state software even though the initial download clearly stated that I was entitled to one state program plus electronic filing.  After a couple of hours of trying to make it work I finally had to contact H&R Block Customer Support and they furnished me a special download.  First time I have had such a problem with H&R.  Very irritating.
2,"They allow it for the personal edition, but not for business.<br /><br />I don't know whether they do this for regulatory, liability, or security reasons, but it's sort of absurd to offer it for personal and not the business edition."
2,I HAVE BEEN USING QUICKEN AND TURBOTAX FOR OVER 15 YEARS.  WAS USING TURBITAX 2004 AND VERY HAPPY WITH IT. IN TRANSITION ( ON-LINE)  TO QUICKEN 2013 I HAVE DISCREPANCY IN BALANCES ON ONE ACCOUNT.  HAVE TRIED TO GET SUPPORT FROM QUICKEN AND GET NOTHING BUT A RUNAROUND. MAY BE OTHER GLITCHES WHICH<br />I HAVE NOT FOUND BUT IT BUGS ME THAT SUPPORT IS NOT AVAILABLE .
1,"I just bought this item and downloaded it.  I didn't want all the budget capabilities, so  I selected the starter addition.  If you have stocks you want to track, you will need the Deluxe version.  Now I am faced with having spend additional money to get what I need.  I'm not sure I'm willing to do that, but it was my mistake.  So I'm just warning any potential purchasers"
3,"Not sure what I can add to the other reviews.  H&R Block is a useful tool for filing your taxes, and if you file electronically it really speeds up your refund.  I have use both H&R block and Turbo Tax in the last few years, both work good for me, H&R Block has been the better deal the last two years."
1,"I've been running this since November.  Today I suddenly had a serious computer problem...very serious. I ran a scan with AVG and it locked up. I called their support line and spent about two hours trying to understand the guy's thick accent.  Just when I thought we were making progress he said he would turn me over to another person who would fix or remove EIGHT different things and it would cost me $280.  I said, WHAT?  Why do I buy your software so you can charge me a ton of money to fix what your software didn't prevent. He started to protest so I hung up on him.<br /><br />I just do not understand why we even have virus protection if it cannot be counted on."
3,I have been using this product for about 4 years.  I used to use Turbo Tax which I stopped using because this is much cheaper.  Turbo Tax is more user friendly but they both do the same thing.
2,Difficult to use and no instructions either.  Should allow test printing of selected forms.  Basic Block software is much easier in format.
2,"While the program is simple, I did not like the surprise at the end ($20 to e-file). This detracted from the attractive cost of Federal & State."
1,"it is sooooo slowwww it's unbelievable! I don't have patience!  I regret getting it :( I even thought my laptop had gotten a virus, that's how slow it is."
1,The download caused a problem with my computer that I had to pay Microsoft to fix--cost me $195.00
4,Quickbooks 2015 is an outstanding business tool that provides a complete accounting and reporting system for our entire business.
4,excellent
3,I was a little concerned about purchasing this since I had never heard of the company before... Works great and no issues. Does everything I need to do. Quick Download.
0,Downloaded it tried to use it and POOF ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! I will NEVER use this site for anything again!! I am sorry I ever trusted these idiots in the firs place!
2,Still cost to much.
3,The new Quicken is a nice upgrade to the older version.  The investment addition alone makes for easier oversight.  The bill paying and budget are easy to review and monitor.  I like this new Quicken a lot.
1,"Not for me. I was hoping to find something that allowed me to create a simple budget. It had that capability and could've been useful... What I didn't realize was that my bank would charge me a monthly $8 fee for using it. The point of my getting it was to help save money. The monthly fee charged for using it defeats that purpose. I realize this is not the fault of quicken, but it should be disclosed more obviously before you spend the money on the software. It could get expensive if you use more than one bank and are charged multiple fees."
0,"I have been a happy Quicken user for almost 30 years.  It has been \\""intuitive\\"" for the most part, which calls to mind the Intuit company's name.  I just purchased 2013 Quicken and am having a lot of trouble using some of the features that used to be nearly flawless.  In particular, creating a \\""lender loan\\"" is nothing short of a nightmare, even with the R10 update and with lots of help from the user community online.  Quicken support is not helpful, in fact they have written an email to me incorrectly stating that Quicken 2013 cannot create lender loans.  When I do want to work with the files I restored from 2010 to 2013 versions, and create a \\""Excel-compatable report\\"" I am now no longer able to open this report using Excel!  Yes, Excel is installed in my computer and was previously able to do this using the report generated with Q2010.  There are many more frustrating features with the so-called upgraded version."
4,"With regards to the download issue, no there is no .exe file. Instead, you're given a big set of zip folders that you need to unzip to whichever directory you'd like to install Poser in. The installation file is located in the \\""Poser9-Poser9-Installer\\"" folder. Not too tricky, but maybe a bit much for novices. It certainly would have been nicer had they just included a .exe file, but I'm sure there's a good reason why they didn't. The total file size is 4.3 GB, which only took about 20 minutes for me to download. Not bad!<br /><br />If you can't afford to shell out the dough for Poser Pro 2012, then Poser 9 is a decent substitute. It's the oldest version that's going to be compatible with the latest DAZ figures (with converter), and that's all I really needed it for personally. Note: If you're importing your Poser work into an older version of Vue (prior to Vue 10), then it's my understanding that it's not compatible. Poser 8 is compatible and Poser Pro 2012 is compatible, but due to some weird release date issues, Poser 9 will only work with Vue 10 and later."
3,"I purchased Norton Anti Virus for my home laptop. Except for minor Trojan attacks (which i rectified by downloading additional patches from Norton website), Norton Antivirus software has been very efficient. I will recommend Norton to anyone interested in a cost effective and reliable anti-virus software."
2,"I upgraded from Quicken Home & Business 2011 in order to maintain tech support.  I have not experienced any improvement as I have used 2013 version.  I have notice that now, when printing a check, you can't just hit the enter key (which is easily located) to confirm the check printed correctly, you have to click on it with your mouse, which means your have to move your attention from the keyboard to the mouse, determine where your cursor is, then move it to the \\""OK\\"" button, and click on it.  Maybe there is a setting somewhere I can change, but having used Quicken for many years, I prefer having the option of hitting the enter key."
2,QUICKEN 2012 WAS MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY.
2,A lot of pops and a little slow
0,Biggest Rip off on Amazon.  Only for one computer and wont do half what a watermark program should.  Amazon should never allow such junk that you cant return.
2,"I tried intuit last year, tried H&R block this year. I would rate using them as exactly the same. H&R block pulled in my tax info from last year, was easy to go through, asked the exact same things, my refund was the same, took 2 hours to do. But this software is cheaper. There were 2 problems however with H&R block, one bigger than the other.  1.  When you are toward the end and everything is getting reviewed, the program may detect an inconsistancy and pulls up a pdf form for you to edit and make it right. The problem is you can't edit this pdf form, so you are stuck with the error. So if you don't have any errors you will never get to this point. If you do then you're screwed. 2. It got the math wrong! It correctly calculated my taxable income, taxes with-held, and taxes I should pay. So to calculate my refund it should subtract taxes with-held minus taxes I should pay. Unfortunately it did not subtract correctly. This caused a change in my refund, and an eight week long wait to get my refund as the government took time to correct this math error.   In summary, probably would have gone with inuit in retrospect."
4,"is the bazooka in the world of office software.  Most of us only need a BB gun, but why not have the power available just in case?  I'm a long time (since the late 80's) PC user recently come over to the Macintosh world and this was my first Mac software purchase.  I was surprised and pleased to find out how similar the Mac version is to the Windows software I'm used to.  Moving files from one platform and also Google docs to my Mac was surprisingly trouble free.<br /><br />Amazon's software store makes the management of your downloads simple.  No more having to look for discs and license codes if you need to reinstall the software, Amazon keeps them all handy for you."
0,After many years of using TurboTax I am leaving because of the changes made in pricing this year.  The new requirement for filing a simple Schedule E requiring the Premier version instead of the Deluxe version at a cost increase of 50% is causing me to leave for good.
3,"The best anti-virus program that I have dealt with.  Far superior over Norton and over AVG, it is much more user-friendly and much less intrusive.  It is also much lighter on resources while it does its job.  It will not just eradicate files on you without allowing you to see what it is doing and why."
0,This was crap it never downloaded
0,"I was a long time Turbotax user....for the last 12 years....but this version along with the issues of losing features was too much.  So, i finally switched to H&R Block and it was one of the best decisions.  The H&R Block software is not only less expensive, but has all the features and forms that were removed from Turbotax,."
3,"I always used TurboTax in the past, I stopped using it because they increased the price so much on the version that I needed. H&R Block worked out great but there was a slight learning curve."
2,"I downloaded the trial first and all my blurays played without issue.  A couple weeks after buying the full version I updated my video-card drivers and one particular series of blurays would never play... after the first second or so of the menu it would freeze and every action would give a &#34;forbidden&#34; message.<br /><br />Other blurays still seemed to play fine, rolling back the drivers didn't help, reinstalling didn't help, and the disks played fine on other players.  I downloaded other trial players and the disks played fine.<br /><br />Unfortunately this particular series of disks was the primary reason I bought the software.  Support was responsive but unable to diagnose the problem and ultimately gave a refund.<br /><br />I had no complaints with the interface or playback aside from the one series of disks."
0,"This year's program was terrible.  You were unable to pull updates.  This is a known bug, because they have a manual work-a-round documented.  You cannot get updated state forms, since there is no workaround for that bug.  You can't file the return without getting the latest updates, but you can't get the updates.  I spent more time on the phone with customer service (multiple times and multiple tickets opened) than I spent completing my taxes.  And there customer service was terrible.  They would not resolve my problem (after hours on the phone), they would tell me they were going to have the next level support contact me, then the next day I would get an email that the ticket was closed.  This happened TWICE.  I have used Turbo tax for years, but never again.  If I could give 0 stars, I would."
4,"A must have for any medical student! Anyone who is studying for step one needs this app; it's exhausting to make your own flashcards, keep them organized, and hopefully get around to using them. This app gives you pre-made flashcard from the USMLE step 1 content, and keeps everything organized, as well as, provides drills to ensure you understand the key points. The best part? You can't lose them, or accidentally spill coffee on them! All of the facts provided as straight forward, and are quick study tools! I recommend reading through the chapter once, attempting to learn it (at least attempt!), and then using this app to make sure you know what you're talking about!"
2,"As I don't use Movie Edit Pro, this is about my experience with Video Sound Cleaning Lab, which is included as a bonus item with Movie Edit Pro 2013.<br /><br />The box says compatible with Windows Vista / 7 / XP, and the editing software product name says \\""2013\\"" so I optimistically and wrongly assumed Video Sound Cleaning Lab could run under Windows 8, as most Windows 7 software will.  But Video Sound Cleaning Lab didn't run for me on Windows 8 (freezes right on startup and requires the Task Manager to dismiss) and it didn't work in Windows 7 or Windows XP compatibility modes.<br /><br />Then I found this:<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />[...]<br />Is Video Sound Cleaning Lab compatible with Windows 8?<br />Unfortunately  this software is currently not compatible with Windows 8 and there are no plans for a patch to be released.<br />You can only use the software on Windows XP, Vista or 7.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />So if you are interested in the bonus \\""Video Sound Cleaning Lab Full Version worth $59.99\\"" please note that Magix says it will not run on Windows 8 and probably never will.  And that's unfortunate because it looks like a useful product.<br /><br />UPDATE NOVEMBER 2013<br /><br />Magix released \\""Video Sound Cleaning Lab 2014\\"" and I am running this program on Windows 8.1 with no problems."
4,I have used this antivirus for a long time. By far the best antivirus out there. The paid version is even better & reasonably priced.
1,"Not very helpful.  I thought all was well, but now have been audited for my failure to enter (or be prompted to enter) my non-imputed income from my 401K contribution which I was not aware was to be included in my &#34;Income&#34;.  Not really &#34;income&#34; for me, but hopefully will be in the future.<br />This was not explained in the H&R block software.  It resulted in my needing to do an amended form for 2011 because it affected specifically my Property Tax results.  Just wish H&R would have caught this and would have made it clear to include this information.  I guess from now on I will have a tax consultant assist me for the &#34;hidden things&#34; I didn't know about."
0,It says 1 year but only have 1 month. Scammed.
3,It was an easy way to update Office 2007 to 2010. It was nice that it kept the default settings from Office 2007.
4,"Easy to use, totals your math automatically, fast and accurate. Can get it at Amazon at a better price than their own site. Downloads quickly."
0,"Ordered this software via download. I'm running an OS version that's supported. But the \\""Amazon Software Downloader\\"" crashes repeatedly. So for the purchase price I have a useless downloader that I never wanted but not the software I bought. I don't need a downloader. HTTP works well enough. It's a stupid process.<br /><br />To add further insult to injury, Amazon won't process a return.  But my bank just did.<br /><br />This is probably my last order from Amazon. I've had enough"
3,"I had several of our computers here at home about to have their Norton 360 expire and found this for $34 (although a good price, the joke was on me because one week later it turned up on an hourly sale price of under $25). I working on PC's and clean viruses for a living and can honestly tell you that no matter what anti-virus suite you purchase it will not protect you 100% of the time (70% is a closer figure), but we've had good luck with this product over the last decade and the two &#34;most liked&#34; features for myself are: The safe search; where you search for something on the web and if the site is okay you get a &#34;GREEN&#34; Light, and the password vault. This allows me to make absurdly long and complicated passwords for each website and not have to remember what they are - Norton takes care of that. If you happen to spend any time searching websites like PCWORLD or PCMAG during the course of a year you'll see at least 3 or 4 &#34;TOP 10 ANTI-VIRUS SUITES&#34;, and usually you'll find the top ten in different numeric positions each time. Read reviews, ask your friends [unless they recommend Microsoft Security Essentials, in which case you'll have to wonder what sort of friend would do that to another :) ], or your local computer shop for suggestions and make a decision based on that."
2,"2014 Tax Planner Errors identified<br /><br />1. LTCG are taxed at 5% for 10% & 15% income brackets instead of 0%<br /><br />2. AMT uses $150K for AMTI exemption phase-out instead of $156.5K (2014 value). The AMT exemption phase-out should be a tax table value updated each year with income brackets because it is also indexed for inflation.<br /><br />3. AMT LTCG taxed at 10% up to the phase-out value and 20% above phase-out value instead of 0% for balance of regular TI remaining in 10% and 15% brackets  and 15% thereafter.<br /><br />4. LTCG is correctly included in AMTI and the phase-out amount is applied to the regular AMT income tax calculation. If the phase-out value is corrected no change is needed.<br /><br />5. If using the scenarios feature in Tax Planner, be aware a previous year's tax rates are being used even when selecting the current year. You will also notice the Years columns are incorrect in the table. This appears to be more than just a typo and is an indicator the wrong year's rates are being pulled from a hidden table.<br /><br />6. Kevin O pointed out in Quicken Community post other shortcomings in more complicated aspects of capital gains which I would be willing to give Quicken a pass on if they could get the simple stuff sorted out. QDI is one aspect that I agree with Quicken should be left to the user to reclassify by transaction if so desired.<br /><br />7. Scheduled State tax quarterly estimated payments made in the following year are included in this year's tax planner deduction. Q1 (last payment due) scheduled estimated payments made in following year should not be included in the current year estimated state tax deduction. They are handled separately in a last year's taxes paid this year input box.<br /><br />8. Tax Planner is a valuable tool and the primary reason I update software each year. Correcting the calculations in the code would not take more than an hour so I don't understand why they still persist in Release 6.<br /><br />9.Until then, I will continue to enter a tax credit manually to account for the overestimation of taxes owed."
3,Norton is a trusted product and does provide excellant protection. I use it on 5 computers and always buy it from amozon as they have the best price. I just use the license from the new product and do an update.
1,there was nothing wrong with it....it just was not what i was looking for.
2,"I purchased this online thinking it would be so easy, as it had been in the past, but something wasn't compatible and I ended up having to take it into a computer store to get help which took over an hour...fault of the program? my computer? can't tell you."
2,"When I purchased Quicken Deluxe 2014 I was excited to use the Android App, but found it to be terribly buggy. Now, having purchased Quicken Deluxe 2015 the reviews for the upgraded App are still dismal. I'd like to know when Quicken intends to address this issue and completely resolve the problems? I won't even seriously consider an App unless it has at least a 4.3 rating and currently your App has a 3.3 rating with countless negative comments. I'd love to be able to refer folks to Quicken but this issue must be addressed before I can do it. As for the Windows based Quicken program...excellent! I have used it since Quicken first became a program and I would rate it a 5 stars on the Windows side of things.    Thanks  Tom Sparks"
1,this is very poor software it will crash on you in the matter of weeks and its hard to get support involved to help you.
4,So much less expensive than other security options- excellent product- absolutely no issues
0,PROBLEMS--bank account file protocol--print preview amount zero<br /><br />The 2014 protocol does not allow the update of prior data such as 2012.  2014 protocol bank account file information contains the routing number.  2012 bank account file information does not contain the bank routing number.  Thus 2014 software will not update 2012 data but rather creates a new file.<br /><br />The 2014 print preview does not carry the amount due in an invoice to then print preview image--the last column --the amount column--in print preview has 0 values.<br /><br />How about some updated software with these problems corrected???
4,Thank you.
1,"I upgraded only because I was about to lose the emailing capabilities from my previous version.  I'm not wild about the sidebar because it takes up a lot of room.  I know you can hide the sidebar, but then you have another step to get to an invoice, purchase order, etc.<br />  I don't care much for the color scheme, or the fact that I'm stuck with it.  It also seems to be at odds with Windows 8. It's very slow to load, seems to crash a lot, and for some reason I have purchase orders that refuse to be closed.  Not all of them, but probably a half dozen or so.  That also happened with my previous version so maybe it's more of a computer issue than the software.<br />  I really like the previous one and am annoyed that I was forced into the 2013.  For $200+ I feel like I've lost ground."
2,"Love Quicken - have used it since 1999.  Upgraded recently to Quicken 2015 and I'm finding it difficult to read and navigate.  I suppose I will eventually figure it out and get used to it, but I miss the old format."
3,"Still getting used to the changes, but the basics are good for what I need. If you are still at 2003, go for the new."
3,"When it comes to making your own website, it can be a really daunting experience as there are so many different software's available on the market, some which require you to have a decent knowledge of HTML, some that don't, but there's also the other main question; \\""is it user friendly?\\"", to get straight to the point, this software doesn't require you to have any HTML knowledge as you build your website with tools that are similar to paint/photoshop and the software does the HTML code writing for you, this makes it extremely user friendly.<br /><br />This version of Xara's web designer is `version 8', previously I had used `version 7' and can say it's pretty much the same handling, but with extra/improved features and usability, as I actually started with `version 7' as a \\""Newbie\\"", I can assure you, if you give some of your time to this software and give yourself a chance to get used to the tools, you will produce some great results.<br /><br />Even with the new features & upgrades I still stick to my opinion that this web designer is NOT suitable for big companies and businesses, reason is although it features a lot of tools/options, it still doesn't compare to what more expensive software's such as Dreamweaver have to offer, however when it comes to personal websites and small businesses, I think this software is hard to beat.<br /><br />My main tip when it comes to those who are new to this software would be not to jump straight in trying to make a website, I would advise playing around with the tools on a blank page whilst now and then going to \\""File\\"" - \\""Preview web page\\"", this will allow you to see how things would look if it were to be published.  Also explore the pre-made layouts which can be selected by going to `Design gallery'(located on a bar to the far right side) then `Website Template Themes', there are loads to choose from and will give you a really good idea on how you can do your website, or you could just use the template!<br /><br />One feature that I would really like this software to have is the ability to make your website \\""fit screen\\"". You will notice that when you visit websites such as Amazon or Google, it doesn't matter if your on a computer with a screen resolution of 1280x800 or 1920x1080, it will always fill your page.<br /><br />However, if you follow some basic rules, whether the persons screen resolution is small or large, they will still be able to view your website clearly:<br />* The most popular screen resolution (stats based from January-March 2012) is 1024x768 & 1366x768, however I personally use 955x700 as a base template and then expand if needed.<br />* Use font sizes no smaller than 10 point.  On my web pages I normally use font sizes of 11, 12 & 14 as these look good on 1920x1080 res screens, whilst not being too big on the smaller ones.<br />* Use simple text fonts for main texts, most popular are; Microsoft Sans Serif, Arial, Verdana, Comic Sans MS & Tahoma, this is to ensure people can clearly read your website.<br /><br />There have been some small issue's I have came across whilst building my website, however they are normally things you can easily resolve; one being is when embedding YouTube videos, you use the `Designs gallery' tab followed by `Page Elements' - `Audio/Video (widgets) - drag the `YouTube' widget onto your page, once done you need to find the video you want and click on \\""share\\"" then \\""embed\\"", you will then be provided with an HTML code which you need to highlight & copy before clicking \\""insert\\"".  The problem is once it's on your page, you can't resize it to a smaller size without it cutting video and when you make it \\""bigger\\"", it actually stays the same size by the width and height stated when embedding it, so the best way is to adjust the size in the html code before copying and inserting it.<br /><br />The main problem I had ran into was when optimizing images(a very important option to keep your website at low memory usage), it would turn transparent `.png' files background into a solid white, I had reported this to the support team and the next update that came out resolved this issue, this shows that Xara's software team are updating issues and are gradually ironing out the small bugs that exist.<br /><br />Uploading your website is super easy, first you will need to \\""Export website\\"" before publishing, once done go to \\""Publish website\\"" and type in your FTP host address, username & password, it's really that easy! #NOTE: The FTP address can be found(if using the Magix hosting site) by going to the control centre.<br /><br />Overall it's a great web designer package and would recommend it!es background into a solid white, I had reported this to the support team and the next update that came out resolved this issue, this shows that Xara's software team are updating issues and are gradually ironing out the small bugs that exist.<br /><br />Uploading your website is super easy, first you will need to \\""Export website\\"" before publishing, once done go to \\""Publish website\\"" and type in your FTP host address, username & password, it's really that easy! #NOTE: The FTP address can be found(if using the Magix hosting site) by going to the control centre.<br /><br />Overall it's a great web designer package and would recommend it!"
1,"I haven't had any success with the Home Designer Interiors 2016, even after about 8 hours of viewing the video instructions (some of them twice).  I watched a number of the videos before purchasing too, and it looked do-able.  Now however I believe some graphics software experience is necessary to make this software work."
0,"Sigh...  Each 'upgrade' takes months to get everything working again.  I would rather just pay Intuit a ransom every couple of years in order to keep using the older version instead of being forced to upgrade and struggle with a new set of bugs  (and countless hours of online search for workarounds).  Having used Quicken for almost 20 years, recent 4 - 5 upgrades have been nothing but dreadful.<br /><br />One hard-learned lesson: do NOT upgrade until you have finished filing tax return and can afford losing some key features for a few weeks (sometimes months)."
3,"Some of the services I used in the 09 version were not available any longer so I was forced to upgrade.  Program works as before but there are new things I haven't utilized yet.  Recommend for someone wanting simple accounting for small business or nonprofit.<br />Regardless of what I read about the delivery company, product was delivered early and in good shape."
2,NOT NEAR AS  EASY TO SET UP A BUDGET THAT I WANTED TOSTART WITH AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

4,"No issues, the young folks like it... i don'see any problems yet it depends how deep yougo with the program"
0,"I have been a Quicken user since the early version 3.0 days. Navigation is an issue to retrain oneself on how to get basic things done. Transfering funds between accounts, not the accounts at an institution but the accounts you set up within Quicken, never found the method as used in previous versions. Setting up loan accounts and refinancing accounts is still a mystery in this new version. What Quicken needs to do is NOT assume they are the sole financial institutions for Quicken users. Most any use or navigation help question I have is based on Quicken being the bank. For me and probably to the majority of users, Quicken is used as a tool to record and track finances NOT to do financial transactions. I'd rather go back to the 2011 version because Quicken no longer suits my needs. I doubt I will buy Quicken again.[[ASIN:B008S0IMCC Quicken Deluxe 2013 [Download]]]"
3,Been using H&R Block for many years - it's one of the best tax programs out there - still needs a few improvements to clarify certain elements.

4,PERFECT
2,"I don't have a huge amount of deductions or credits but I do have a rental room so I needed the Premier edition.<br />While the step-by-step makes doing your taxes easy, it still seems to lack intuitiveness for the odd-ball situation.<br />While the Federal E-File is free, you still have to pay for the state e-file.<br />In my case, the charges would have been more than I was getting back; the state went hardcopy via snail-mail.<br />If I couldn't deduct the cost of the software as a tax preparation expense, I don't know if I would get it.<br /><br />For the person who doesn't know the difference between a 1099 and a 1040, it's a must have."

I would this give a better rating if this column could be added. I also have printing check issues with the  2013 version. The date and amount do not print on the check.

4,"I was looking for a more 'reputable' AV given my online use so I called my PC manufacturer and they recommended this product - however, they took me to McAfee's website where the price was $44.99. I told the rep that Amazon had it MUCH cheaper and he verified this with his supervisor so we went ahead and bought it and installed it. For $17, you can't go wrong. It's fully functional and subscription is verified by McAfee."

0,"Punch Home Design for Mac v.17 misses the mark on ease of use, usability, features and stability.  The documentation is a dictionary of menu items and the tutorials are pure marketing.  It is almost impossible to create a floor plan that will be accepted by a building department as elevations are photo realistic instead of line drawing.  Printing is a night mare as you have NO control over what is printed or the framing on the page.  Use of cntrl/cmd Z to undo an action frequently results in crashing the program and corrupting file  - rendering all saved work useless.  I have requested a refund from Encore and would only recommend this product to someone who is a true master of CAD and plans to dedicate their life to learning this product."
1,"(Note: Amazon is using the old naming of the products, and I accidentally downloaded and installed Complete - see the Webroot site and the Amazon comparison chart).<br /><br />I've been using \\""Webroot\\"" for about four or five years, including when the product was Prevx. Webroot acquired Prevx and eventually replaced their Webroot flagship product with the Prevx product (you can do an Internet search if you want more info). I'll focus this review on my experience with the company and product.<br /><br />I'd decided to downgrade from SecureAnywhere \\""Complete\\"", for two reasons - their Backup and Sync feature currently uses Sugarsync technology. So, if you are using Sugarsync, you might want to drop down to Internet Security Plus, which I did. Also, a PCmag article states that the Webroot password feature uses LastPass password technology. Unfortunately, there is no warning from Webroot on this (Sugar Sync and LastPass), you just get to find it out on your own. The other reason is that I do not want the \\""Permanently Erase with Webroot\\"" for Windows Explorer (XP/7) feature that comes with Complete. If you've ever accidentally erased a file, you might understand why ... a personal preference. (Unless it has changed in the past month, you cannot control how this feature is permanently set on your local computer.  When there is a Webroot product update it changes the setting back to default, a downside to cloud-based.)<br /><br />In addition, their default config may setup Webroot to \\""Maximum\\"" Self Protection security setting despite the fact their own suggestion is that \\""Medium\\"" \\""provides maximum possible compatibility with other security software\\"".  If you are using Norton 360 you are likely to get a recommendation from Norton to uninstall Webroot.  If Webroot wants to proclaim they are compatible with other programs, then should offer specific settings with a few of the leading products in the marketplace.  That would not be hard for them to do.<br /><br />Regarding usingwith other security programs ... when using this program, I've always used it with another computer-based security program, in the past with the Zone Alarm full suite (which I eventually had too many issues with after using over ten years), then with Norton Internet Security Suite 2012 and now Norton 360 2013. While I am not a tech, I started in computer sales in 1985. and software sales in 1993, and would put myself in the intermediate category. From this level, I have not seen any significant issues running with another security program. Could there be something on a much more technical level where there is a conflict? That is possible. When I first started using Prevx, it was a very simple anti-virus, anti-spyware program. Now, \\""Complete\\"" includes a \\""firewall\\"", backup & sync, password management, etc. So, that opens up more opportunity for conflicts. But, I think I have only experienced one virus in the last five years. So, this dual approach has worked fairly well for me.<br /><br />Regarding support ... One criteria I look at with software is what support does the company offer, and when. Webroot only offers technical support for consumers from M-F, 7am to 6 pm MT. They have sales there later at night and on the weekends, but not support. In this day and time that is very weak. Recently, I submitted a support ticket online and 29 hours later had not received a response. I finally just called them. After about a fifteen plus minute wait, I got a helpful USA-based technician who answered my questions. If you are having a malware issue, do you want to wait that long? What if it happens Friday night? Update: Well, that issue ended up not being resolved, so I started again this week. After waiting on hold for over thirty minutes, I spent the next hour and a half with a tech that remoted into my computer. He spent time deleting items from my registry (not a comforting feeling) and in the end was not able to resolve the issue. Then I was told it would be escalated andthat someone would be contacting me. I asked when and was told basically when they get to it, maybe a couple of days. Then this afternoon, I get an email from the tech that I worked with (I did not know it was him until after we exchanged a couple of emails, that gave me instructions of what to do to resolve the issue (on my own) ... it did not work. Update2: Today, Support answered the phone quickly and this time resolved the issue remotely.  Amazon not labeling the software version properly (still not) turned out to be a mini \\""time\\"" nightmare.<br /><br />In closing, personally I like \\""Webroot\\"", but would not use it as my only security program for the reasons stated above.  I would recommend their basic product (SecureAnywhere Antivirus) - that I've used for a few years, maybe Internet Security Plus (your needs versus features), but NOT the \\""Complete\\"" version."
2,"Havent spent much time on it.  But, I have found it easy to manipulate pdf files."
2,I am sick.  I just purchased this software from Intuit and paid 109.00 plus an additional 49.95 for state and discoverded it here on Amazon for 75.00 for both!  I will look on Amazon first from now on before going to Intuit!
1,as expected
1,"Updating account information (passwords, etc) seems buggy.  It doesn't store them as you would expect - even though it says you have stored them properly.  When it syncs/checks your (bank/credit card) accounts online to display on the screen, it says it synced and updated using your old password even though you have to login to your (credit card) accounts online with a totally different/new one.  How is it giving me up to date information on my main page when it's clearly not using the correct login credentials?"
1,way to difficult to use
0,I cannot be honest about my problems as amazon will not post it.. purchase disk only
3,Can't beat the price and all the extra features.
3,"Easy to download and install. Seems to be working well. I find the &#34;High Disk Usage&#34; warnings annoying, but that can probably be eliminated."
1,Would  not  download  Error  2753
1,Best anti-virus is common sense.  That coupled with Microsoft Security Essentials (a free download from Microsoft) and the built-in Windows Firewall is all anyone really needs. If you're running Windows 8 then Microsoft Security Essentials is called Windows Defender and already installed. Third party anti-virus suites are no longer needed.  This isn't the 1990s.
2,"I bought this to go with Windows 8.  Not really excited about the UI design, however.  Marginal upgrade.  Really not worth the price."
0,"This download doesnt work for 1041 income tax return, it keeps saying  the form requested by the interview is not installed, the latest form can be obtained from updating , and I keep updating and nothing happen. complete waste of money and time and the frustration from not being able to do it...every time I update it would say update succeseful .Its not user friendly. and this is not refundable ."
4,"My Kaspersky Pure 3.0 expired earlier this year so I bought this Internet Security suite as a replacement (which was WAY cheaper by buying the digital version, and who needs disks nowadays?). The install was painless, the product code was emailed to me and the ability to install on multiple devices meant that every computer in my house got a sparkling new security suite. Next year, when this expires, guess what I'll be buying again? Yup, Kaspersky."
2,Difficult to learn.
0,"Had so many problems,gave up!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!It wasted my time and money!!!!!!!!Adobe systems susks it only asked for my lic key once and I entered order#"
3,Have used this program for many years; buying through Amazon made it a little cheaper; buying through Amazon Smile helps our school.  Programs functions well; no download issues.
1,"I unchecked History; CCleaner deleted History anyway. I wanted my History so I could look up something I needed. Recent posts on Facebook disappeared. What the heck? It's hard to tell, but my computer does not seem to be working any faster; the problem must be deeper than this simple fix. I wish I had not run this program."
2,Took several times to download. Get the disc!
4,Simple enough for me to use but complete enough to have all my business needs for accounting and invoicing.
0,"Trouble from the get go. I have been using Quicken for years, and while I haven't been impressed, it's gotten the job done. I had to 'upgrade' to Quicken 2015 from Quicken Essentials because they were stopping support). This version does not work. The only thing that has worked right for me so far was the purchase and download. I can not properly link accounts so I can't download information from my bank. The account I was able to link to the bank shows a wildly incorrect balance. The other account simply will not, can not, link. I was able to &#34;add&#34; the account but that doesn't accomplish what I need, and what was easy in the past when shifting from an older version of Quicken to Essentials. I spent 2+ hours on chat (no phone support - chat is horrible for this sort of problem) with Quicken attempting to explain and address the problem, to finally be told, &#34;this is a problem your financial institution needs to solve.&#34; I then spent 2 hours on the phone with someone at my major national bank (she couldn't solve the problem and resorted to google herself) only to finally have her give up and tell me that &#34;this is a problem that Quicken needs to solve.&#34; I'm amazed that Intuit gets away with this and there's not a class action suit, and that they still take people's money for this product. The question now is - what to use instead???"
3,I'm a casual user and had great results recording videos for a company project.  I'm having problems recording a previously recorded football game.  Tech support is awesome!  I can always count on them for help.
1,Seamed ok but just didn't work for me
2,"It's great software to use, but if your State Return gets rejected, it is difficult to go back in and make corrections.  Especially if the software offers to take you back in and make corrections.  At that point, TT leaves you standing at the bus stop with no bus in sight."
2,"JUST HARDER TO USE THE OFFICE ON XP, THAT I WAS USE TO.  WILL TAKE TIME TO GET TO KNOW IT."
2,"I am satisfied with this product for for bank accounts.  I had offline data in another product which converted accurately.  Aside from a tedious time deleting downloaded duplicate transactions to get everything in sync setup was easy.  I find the reminder system to be rather nice.  I am not satisfied with this product for investments accounts, and am on the verge of giving up an going back to spreadsheets.  After several false starts I found a decent  methodology for getting share balances and basis in agreement with accounts.  It was tedious but doable to fill in recent transfers between bank accounts and investments.  Now, I'm having a terrible time filling in the transfers between investment accounts.  I can't find a way to do it and get correct tax and account balance reporting.  I do have questions in to the support group.  FOLLOW-UP:  I found by trial and error that the reporting on investment accounts works better if the first transaction in each investment account buys shares rather than transfers funds into the account.  I also found that a fairly complicated way to make both transfers between IRA's and IRA distributions work at the same time.  So, I've upgraded my rating by a star, though I still think getting started with investments is much more difficult than it needs to be.  This has been aggravated by my inability to get investment account registers to filter like the bank account registers.  In fairness to the product, investments require lots of difficult to implement capability.  On the other hand I paid extra for the capability."
1,Turbotax is more friendly and easier to use.
4,"I bought this subscription directly through Adobe and I gotta say, it's the best thing I've bought for my hobby!<br /><br />$120 a year is a deal especially when LR costs $150 standalone.<br />Without this subscription I would never be able to afford Photoshop, $10/month is easy on the wallet and Creative Cloud's platform is simple to install.<br />Updates for Photoshop CC are simple, painless and quite fast, comparable to how Valve's &#34;Steam&#34; platform installs applications.<br /><br />One thing I will note that is a bit of a pain: Updating Lightroom is like the standalone version, which I never found impressive.  It installs via Creative Cloud but still bugs me when I open the program (vs a system notification on Photoshop CC) and requires to go to a webpage, download the installer and run it.  It's 2014, all programs should be able to update themselves.<br />Not enough of an annoyance to take away a star, but still a pain when compared to Photoshop CC."
0,"I have been a Quicken user since 1993 and have purchased upgraded versions every 2-3 years. Until this year, I have endorsed their Quicken product. Quicken has been doing a series of patches in late April through today. Their R5 & R6 patches didn't block access to my data file as it did to so many others. Last week they announced that an R8 patch was available for download that would insure that you wouldn't have any future issues in gaining access to your data files. Even though I didn't have file access problems up to this point, like a fool I took the bait and download the R8 patch yesterday (5/30) and instead of protecting me from future data access issues, it now asks for a password to get access to my data file that I never set up, so Quicken has now blocked my access to my data. The irony of all of this is that they claim that these patches were to improve security for mobile app users.  Well they have accomplished that goal. No hacker can access my data including me. Tried to use chat support yesterday together get help fixing this,  but chat was also broken likely due to overload. Before you buy this product do yourself a big favor and do a web search for Quicken 2015 patch R6, R7, R8.  This is all from the same company that gutted major parts of their TurboTax 2014 Deluxe product and forced users to buy their most expensive version (they did end up doing a refund). Once I get to a support person, I know that it will involve hours of investment on my part to get back to current data. If I'm lucky that process can start today."
3,This product has worked well for me and easy to use. I've tryed other software and I like this one best.
3,"Print copies are crisp and clear.  Scanner works well, too.  I have not had the opportunity to use the fax yet, but I expect it will work as well."
4,"Easy to download, install, and configure. Haven't seen an infection the whole time I've used it.<br />Wish they didn't keep pressuring me to buy something, but I suppose that's to be expected when the best costs nothing... they gotta try and make a buck somehow."
1,i searched the web for this product at a better price and i found one for less then half of what these guys want heres the link.
0,"I also have been a loyal TurboTax user for the past several years, because of the consistency of the product and the seeming integrity of the company.  With the recent change to the 2014 tax software and the lame excuse by the company I am currently looking for a new software that is compatible with prior year turbo tax files.  I'm switching"
0,Much trouble and still cannot download.  Very frustrating.  The help does not help.  I would like a refund and search other products which will do the same.
0,Won't download!
2,I was never a shy spelling geek. But  I would of never made it to the second round of any Spelling Bee. This is a great game (easy download). But I feel like it should of had more option and more mini-games. Otherwise anyone would really love this game.
0,"I bought this for protection against spyware, trojans and malware and that specific scan doesn't want to update and scan"
1,BIG problem with this download.  I am not sure why it isn't working because I've never had probs with Turbo tax before.  The state won't load and updates don't work!  I keep getting a runtime error.  UGH this is so frustrating after working hours on the Federal.
2,"Downloaded Norton 360,because my other security package expired and needed a new security package,i had problems with error<br />messages Ithink your down load contained a virus"
1,I was hoping for something with an easier learning curve. It took me two weeks to figure out some basics and I'm still learning how to do some more advanced projects. I find myself resorting to old programs just to finish what I've started through Paint Shop Pro.
4,Love Acrobat. So handy!
4,"PagePlus is an excellent desktop publishing application that I have been using for years. Since version 6 is already out, this is an old version as clearly stated but it is extremely powerful nonetheless. I found it capable of doing everything I need to do in my self publishing business. And, at the present price it is a great bargain that I gladly recommend to anyone interested in any kind of desktop publishing."
1,Does not work well with Outlook email dictation.
3,I have been happy with TurboTax for over 15 years....but no more.  They have changed the software for 2014 without notice - and only so you will have to pay more to get the same as the years before.
0,"I bought Quicken Mac 2015 because I assume Intuit will not maintain 2007 much longer and I thought I would get through the pain sooner rather than later. My Quicken 2007 data goes back to 1982 and the accounts are all tied with transfers and balanced to the penny.    The import from Quicken 2007 is impossible would never recommend Quicken 2015. Spent weeks untangling the mess it made. Three key problems: 1.) The original file had accounts with cash flow transfers between accounts. All of those transfers were not maintained. Null records were entered more than once sometimes and all the history of transfers is lost. 2.) The program recalculated all the records using shares times price to get amount when it brings in history. The result is rounding errors that cause the original account information to no longer be accurate compared to the original brokerage firm's records. Makes all the imported history wrong. I had to redo hundreds of old records.  3.) The program will not add new brokerage information correctly to an imported file.  You end up with double entries. The existing transaction recognition algorithm is flawed.  I had to generate new Quicken 2015 account files with the start dated within the current broker file's date range or I get a date range error???? I was able to clean up the old history and simply generate new accounts from the date I transition to 2015.    The user interface is the old Windows design and I hate it. I keep my Quicken 2007 up to date and I have not made up my mind if I will keep 2015 or just take the loss.  It takes an iCore 7, 3.4 GHZ  Mac about 30 seconds to load the program! Slow!!!    What happen to the XFR so one moves shares between accounts in one step? Now I have to remove one at a time from an account and add one at a time to an account.  Watch list is missing. The Calendar is crude; you can't schedule or edit transactions from it.  Printing checks is poorly supported. The spacing is a downgrade from 2007. Checks don't lookprofessional. It does not import QIF files so one can bring in Q2007 files one at a time.  It has a nice feature to merge securities. You can't sort your securities by symbol so they end up in a different order than the brokerage.  I still can't schedule a future transaction and tell how to edit or post it.  Never had trouble with Reconcile in 2007 it is hopeless in 2015. Transitioning to Q2015 from Q2007 can be done but you better have a lot of patience and know what you are doing! Not for the faint hearted."
4,"If you've used TurboTax before, you'll be happy. If it's your first time trying it, you'll be happy. Unfortunately, the price went up 10 dollars over last year, but it's still a great tool and worth the money."
3,"I have been using Turbo Tax for many years and like it.  This year, though, I was not too happy as I was finishing up my taxes.  The Printing and E-filing and E-filing versus Paper filing was not as smooth as in the past."
1,"It took several times to get the second piece of this software package to download and I'm still not sure if I have it all.<br />I'd advise buying the CDs in the box and installing it that way.<br />Also, I got absolutely no response when I tried to contact customer support.<br />So buying this was very much not a satisfying experience.<br />Also, a refund/rebate advertised with this product does not appear to be part of the download purchase. The advertising did NOT make this clear.<br />Buyer beware!"
0,"I have used Quicken for Windows for 10+ years and loved it.  I recently switched to a Macbook Pro, and downloaded Quicken Essentials for Mac.  It has none of the functionality of the Windows version.  This version does not download and autoreconcile.  If you manage more than one account, it is useless."
1,pop ups are still everywhere.
3,I had been eyeing this product for a while and when I caught a sale I dove in. I'm so glad I did. The automated features in this software make it SOOO much easier to animate based on others I have felt with. I've already sprung for the upgrade and been even more wowed
4,Have been using for years and I was not disappointed with this purchase either! Makes photo editing easy after you learn your way around.
3,"Like others posting today, purchased nuMaps onetime update code only to run into the error code \\""Our system is experiencing difficulty processing your card. Please try this process again on the Garmin site.\\""      Update:  I was successful on Monday getting the code to work and the download to install to my GPS.  Great price and worth the hassle in the end."
3,"I had some trouble initially installing the program.  I called customer service and got lots of emails telling me that since they hadn't heard from me, that they were closing the complaints out.  I kept calling and kept receiving automatic emails closing out the trouble ticket.  After I figured out what the problems was and made some changes, the program now works fine.  It updates every evening.  All I have to do is give it permission and it updates.  I'd buy it again."
3,Too many ads. If you had a lower priced low end product more people would make the move and buy.it
0,"Downloaded the software from WinZip official site. This was a huge mistake. The software comes with malware and adware. My internet security software was able to block the &#34;adware&#34; that came with the program, but did not block the &#34;Vosteran&#34; malware that came with it. Vosteran changed my browser setting. Wasted my time just trying to get rid of it."
0,"So we bought this was the best price we could find for this product, so we bought it. The download took a really long time. When we got to the end and went to file our taxes it said it was $20.00 in additional charges to efile for the state. It didnt tell us this until after we spent all our time putting all our information in. The company designs the program to rip you off for as much money as they can get. Don't buy this product if you want to file for the state. It was a complete waste of time and money."
2,"I ordered this because i had problems with my 2011 version and could not get any help from Quicken. I have been a Quicken customer for years, about 6 versions i have bought. Not much difference between 2011 and 2013. The price from Quicken website is too high, so i got a great price here on Amazon."
3,This package is very good. At very reasonably price I am getting the 3 laptop covered antivirus. It is worth-able.
1,"This product has a great theory behind it, but because it doesn't include all colleges and universities, I don't think its a great product. Had to beg for a return because I didn't know &#34;University of Redlands&#34; was not on the list..the school exists! Granted, schools have to have a contract to be included in the list, but the verification process was a little trivial too."
4,"This software is the perfect envelope printing utility. Just type in the address, hit print and you're done. I've been using it for my small business for years with multiple printers and versions of windows. It does one thing and it does it very well. Add the fact you can save commonly used addresses and it becomes perfect."
4,"Truly amazing the way the product synced my bank transactions and categorized them.  I'm still struggling with the budget portion of the product but that's easily mastered, i just need a little time to play with the function."
4,"I have used this software for more than 10 years on several computers, the best out there<br />and it's free,even if you paid for one it might not work this good. It  will catch all the unwanted  items trying to get in your computer."
0,"I'm out ,  Bad management decision to change  your business model  and disrespect your loyal (10 year) customers."
0,"I installed it on my Windows 8.1 uefi computer and it died a blue screen death within 3-4 minutes of booting up with the error: PNP_DETECTED_FATAL_ERROR. I rebooted 5 more times to confirm the problem, crashed every time.  My computer hasn't had a single problem for over a year until this installation of Norton Security 2015.  I uninstalled it and the computer runs fine again.  Now I've installed a trail version of AVG Internet security and there are no problems after the first hour.  I did install the Norton software on my other 2 computers, both Windows 7.x and they seem fine.  I will probably go with AVG from now on."
1,"I have been using HR block since 1997. I downloaded this for the Mac, and it won't load, but instead says &#34;Please wait a moment while we check for important notifications&#34; and freezes. In the activity monitor it says the app is &#34;Not responding&#34;. I have manually downloaded an update from hrblock's website, but it still didn't fix it. I checked my firewall to make sure that nothing is being blocked, rebooted, and I finally contacted HR Block over chat. I was , and was over 100 in the queue to be helped. I got to #58 an hour later, and then the chat application crashed. Now I'm back to #75 &#34;in line&#34;. I'm hoping I can get this fixed tonight.<br /><br />My guess is that HR Block will get this fixed, but I'm definitely frustrated."
0,"Complete Junk.  The firewall are blocking things that it's not supposed to even though the rules are set to allow access. It even blocked my printer, prevent any of my home network PC to see each other, stopped my team viewer and other services etc.  All were set to allow access in the firewall rules. Once I disabled the firewall, then everything is back to normal.  Do not buy this."
2,Turbo tax is getting more and more confusing.
0,"I've been using TT Deluxe since 2008 and this time they silently dropped the Schedule D - Capital Gain & Loss without any notice. If there's an explanation with price increase notice, I should've bought it no matter what because of TT's product quality. I ended up upgrading to Premium during the tax prep which is very annoying and I feel deceived & ripped off. Will go back to TaxCut next year which is more reliable, trust-worthy and have honest business mind-set. I am not going to recommend TT to anyone around me."
1,"Unfortunately, this software is chock full of booby traps designed to steer you towards purchasing extra services.  My advice to Intuit, just create a sound straightforward product that helps the customer.  They'll come back for more and give you good reviews.  The software is not INTUIT-ive.  There is good logic behind it and I like when it performs as expected.  But the bugs indicate a real laziness and disregard for the consumer experience."
1,"Didn't buy this from Amazon, but this is a terrible excuse for a DTP.  My gripe is once a photo is cropped it tries to return to its original aspect when inserted back into the project.  Wrote to customer support and was promised help, but it has been over 2 months now and nothing has been resolved.  I returned the product to the manufacturer and still haven't gotten the promised refund."
3,This product shouldn't be sold to just anyone. Nearly every single bad review has been user error. There is nothing wrong with this product. It does the job right with very little computer knowledge. Here are a few tips:<br />*I am giving them 4 stars because the driver install time seems a little slower than windows default. But be patient. If it doesn't install your driver or is taking longer than usual then close the program completely with phone still plugged in and reopen. It should be either ready or zipping through the driver install much faster. Also if you have a newer phone you will need to accept a box and also check &#34;always allow&#34; on your device.<br />*which leads me to my next tip. This program is safe. It needs USB debug persmissioms within the developer options because it is side loading your information from one device to another. Its not as simple as copy and paste. There is a lot that goes on during a transfer other than copying your files. It has to insert text from another device. Adding call logs. Go check your call log. Look for an option to add a missed call. There isn't one. Look in your messaging app. Is there an option to add a text document conversation to your already existing messages? Please understand that is what's required when dealing with 3rd party programs. If you have ever had your carrier salesman transfer your information from your old phone to your new phone then he/she has to do the same thing. We use a machine (cost $800 used. Over $1000 new) that all it does is transfer information from one phone to another. It requires developer mode also.<br />*if you're the kind of person that actually uses &#34;tech support&#34; then this is not a product for you. It is 2014. Ask a family member or learn to use a forum. Tech forums are the best way of resolving any software specific issue. Please don't buy this product if you are computer illiterate. And if you do then please don't give the company a bad rating because you can'tfigure it out and tech support didn't do it for you.
4,"I have been a Norton user for a few years now. It is a great program that has saved my toosh on more than one occasion! The price here on Amazon is drastically cheaper than on Nortons own website, and it is SO EASY to download from Amazon!

3,This product worked well and was a good price. Still not sold on its interface--think TurboTax has a smoother look and usability. I opted not to use their product this year.
1,This is another product in the endless line of products claiming to &#34;cure&#34; all PC problems.<br />Well guess what? IT DON'T.  My simple situation was not even addressed by this super cure all... I sent it back.
2,A bitt slow like LR 3.5 not much improvement
3,"Easy to use, and quick and responsive customer support."
4,very fast & easy to download to computer.  will buy again next year this way instead of having to go out to a store and buy it.
2,"I'm just not very happy with the moves Intuit is making on ANY of their product lines.  I LOVE TurboTax, but the question is &#34;How Much?&#34;."
0,"No good,"
2,"Did finally get this to work but installation was time consuming, confusing, and frustrating."
4,"It is the best software for taxes, it gives you every possibility, & it catches any possible mistakes, amazing, really!!!"
3,Good once installed.  Had issue with not being able to choose a language during install and could not continue past that point.  MS tech online reset internet (options) browser to all default settings and then was able to choose language to continue.  Very good product and value once installed.
0,Don't waste your money. Bought on Amazon then TaxAct wanted paid too. Go to good CPA.
0,With all the negative issues reported after buying turbotax I took my taxes to an accountant
3,"For my needs, this software does the job. It's a much better deal than Turbotax, which would not have saved me any more money. The only issue I have with it is once it's been downloaded, instructions aren't real clear on how to open it. Didn't take long, though. Still would recommend it. I've been using H and R for several years."
4,I love this tax software. It is so easy to use and follow. It makes doing my taxes a breeze.
3,Seems to protect but my computer is getting slow download times so I am not sure.
1,"It's the worse version of Quicken that I've ever seen, and I've been using Quicken for a decade.<br /><br />If it weren't so difficult to back up, I would.  For me it crashes continuously, usually with no warning, and never with an error code.  Fortunately, there's never a loss of data, and interestingly, when I restart the program, the action I was taking when it crashed works!  I've uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail.  The one thing I did that reduced the crashing associated with One-Step updates was to &#34;uncheck&#34; some of the banks (reduce the number of links it makes) and do them separately.  That seemed to help - but didn't resolve that type of crash overall.<br /><br />Secondary, but also a real bother... it's terribly slow.  When updating a transaction the program is non-responsive (with a &#34;busy cursor) for as much as 10-seconds - an eternity when you're working lots of transactions.<br /><br />The Intuit/Quicken websites and knowledge bases are totally useless - they recognize some of the crashes, but offer no viable workarounds or solutions (that work for me anyway).<br /><br />To be clear on crashes, they occur on almost all types of actions... be it editing or inputting a transaction, one-step update (as noted), even creating a report.  It's VERY disappointing.... and I'm very hopeful that Intuit is taking action to correct this dismal update of an otherwise fine product."
1,It downloaded ok but wouldn't work with my computer(windows 7).  Not sure why but I used another kind which worked ok.
1,"I wanted a basic deck design program -- just something to basically draw a deck, add some tables and chairs, and see it in 3D (walk around it). You can do all of this with the software however I found that after you set the basic deck size, any changes to expand it will leave a giant 'hole' in the deck when you render it in 3D. This doesn't happen every time, but enough to make it annoying. I found after awhile I just lived with the fact that my tables were floating in mid-air and i just imagined a deck there.  Also, there was no ability to draw decks with multiple levels, you could design it with the concept of \\""stories\\"", and it just doesn't work well when trying to design something with a couple of different elevations. This is a major drawback in my opinion and rendered this software useless to me. Oh well..."
1,The problem is if for any reason you have to re-install it in a modified environment. See my ACCESS 2013 review.
0,"Free version has limited uses, not what was expected and it actually slowed my pc's performance."
0,I can't find it and need help. I seem to have 34-bit and 64-bit so I can't get anything to open and I don't know how to uninstall one of them. And which one should I uninstall? And have I been charged for more than one product?
4,"is an ancient seagoing word for STOP! which is pretty much what it does very well, for free; stop evil viral infections on your computer. While the geek squad in the electronics store would love to sell me some expensive stuff to do this (sorry guys, I already blew my wad on the computer), I simply can't afford that. My computer savvy friend has been using this (along with a couple other free antivirus programs) for years with no real issues. For those of us on a severe budget, this is great. Doesn't hurt to throw on other legitimate free programs as well (we used Avast, Spybot, and AVG)."
1,The loan feature has been totally ruined so non-usable.  Way too rigid.  Does not allow changes or dates prior to present.  Interest calculation is incorrect.  Having problems with it shutting down.  Total disappointment.  Other &#34;improvements&#34; such as some reporting not worth the ruination of the loans.
3,Good value for Office users.
2,"I bought MyMemories to have a desktop resident scrapbooking program to avoid uploading a lot of photos to a web site for online scrapbooking.  As a male user, I find the design elements (both those included, and those for sale on MyMemories web site) feminine.  This is particularly true of the background papers and embellishments.<br /><br />Another annoying feature is that there is there is no way to change the color or opacity of text boxes.  This is a useful feature when writing photo captions on dark or highly textured background paper.  There is a work around, but it's tiresome to have to create a shape, size it, place it over the caption text, and then bring the text forward.  In MSWord it's a simple matter of creating a text box then coloring and sizing the box background to make the text stand out.<br /><br />My recommendation is that MyMemories recruit some male oriented designers and see if the can market the program to men."
3,Would have given it a 5 if it had come with instructions or at least the ip to activate it. I had to contact McAfee to get the correct activation address. Other than that it works great and the price is right!
3,"I really can't bring myself to write that I love or even like Turbo Tax.  This is a product I have to purchase every year, spend hours and hours learning to use, while hating every minute of the experience.  Inevitably, the software is buggy, imports are imperfect and there ends up being much more manual and error prone tedium than anyone could have foreseen.  Who like paying taxes?  Will probably do this again next year..."
4,"Much better price from a trusted company like Amazon. As long as you know what version and how to install software on your PC, this is a no brainier. I saved over $30 purchasing it Amazon. Symantec wanted me to upgrade at the full price of $70 for the same software."
4,"This program was easy to install and is easy to use for me, especially learning a new program. Glad I got this."
4,"Have been using Avast for many years and have never had any issues. Have installed this on many laptops including units running Windows 8 to correct issues on friends and families units. Great product, highly recommend."
0,"Is TurboTax kidding!  $74.99 to do my rental property, which I was able to do with Turbotax Deluxe at for $29.99.  I am switching to HR Block.  I hope the TurboTax Executives take notice.  You have lost a loyal customer of 15 years."
4,Easy to use and works great. Does not do our city tax though.
2,About what you would expect from Intuit.
1,I have to go through no end of hassles to get my Microsoft Money file converted so that I could open it with Quicken. Including downloading a trail version of Microsoft Money from the Microsoft website. Since Microsoft is discontinuing support for Money I do not know if that trail will be available in the next month or so.  Once I get the file converted I have had no trouble with the software. I really like the way that the important information that you want for each account is right in front of you.
2,Was forced to upgrade.  Making connections to financial institutions is not intuitive.  Screen display is buggy.  Very disappointed.  Would have been happy to stay on the older version until this one has been out for a while.
3,I've been a fan of Adobe products since the 90's. They make good editing and creative software and when you can get two good<br />products for under $100 that is a good buy for me. And both products will hold up for years to come.
4,good windows 8.1 pro upgrade cd key~
2,"The load times for HD videos were several times that of the free Windows movie maker - which is easy to use and very basic. Since my only purpose to try this out was to cut edit only, this may be the reason why, as this software has tons of options that may require this excessive uploading time. In addition, the free download did not include a pdf manual and had annoying effects constantly running when I tried to use it.<br /><br />This  program may be of interest to those who want lots of fancy editing features, but not for those who just want to cut out parts of large file HD videos to save on hard drive space."
3,I have a love hate relationship with this product. I love it when it is working and I hate it when it isn't . Most of the time it is but when it isn't they have a great tech team !
3,This is a better deal than re-subscribing from Norton. Woner why nobody picks up on the fact that downloads should be cheaper than buying disks.
1,I just found out after using TT for years that you don't have access to sch E for 2013 unless you upgrade from deluxe to premier for a 25.00 premium. What a rip off. I understand that if you buy the cd you do get the form and other forms that have been excluded in the online version. Tech support will not tell you this. I am going to check it out at a retailer.
0,"I downloaded this product and was eager to use it.  I am a novice I will admit, but I am surrounded by IT people who help me out a lot.  Thank goodness for that. Once the download took place and I opened the program, it worked great for the first 4 hours, after that my computer was so slow, I couldn't do anything, my IT guy came and couldn't believe all the Mal-ware, he seemed to believe it came with the download.  Amazon was great about replacing the product with one that came with a disk.  That review is above.  Very disappointed"
2,"My software problem was the Amazon downloader. Had to uninstal and reload, thanks to Amazon tech. However, could not load my Turbo Tax PDF from 2013 because TaxAct site was down for maintenance?  So far able to start my return, waiting for more tax information.  This has to be better than Turbo Tax that snookered all their customers. I'll update later this month.  Next challenge may be brokerage account loading."
3,Love it.  It does just what I want.
2,It did not display excel spreadsheets as well as promised so I ended up buying MS software.
3,Not that easy to use but that's the nature of the function. It certainly offers a way to do almost anything a non-pro would want to do.
4,Great computer security. Norton  360 is an all inclusive computer security product. More stable and compatible than Symantec. I am very satisfied with the product.
3,"I have been a Quicken user for years and have been stuck using the Windows version on my Mac. I was also a beta tester for Intuit on this project and have seen many upgrades to this product. It is nothing like the very anemic Quicken essentials. Is it perfect, no but is is a good start and I for one believe Quicken Marcus when he says that the updates i want in this product will come. So, who is this for, this is for the person who needs good solid basic financial software with an eye towards the future."
3,"The download was easy;  as usual the product verification ID is enormously long 25 characters but loaded that just fine and so far the word doc is working like a champ.  However....unbelievably microsoft has taken advantage of download software customers to automatically load up the icon for microsoft outlook and deceptively make the customer think we need to just load in our product code to activate it.  After a coupe of times of rejecting the product code I realized it wasn't sold as part of the bundle and it was just a promo!!!  More annoyance, the icon is  planted on the MAC dock automatically and prevents shut down of the computer.  The only way to get around it is to place the activation window in the trash and then you can shut down your computer.  C'mon Microsoft!!!  Are you that desperate to plug products a customer doesn't buy that you'll risk alienating your customers with this numblingly aggravating marketing gimmick?"
1,"not the easy program I thought, takes alot of time and not for the regular photo customer that wants to do quick fix and I use more complicated photo programs so this is mid range without the results I expected good thing I got it with a free promotion"
1,I do like the reporting capability but it is not Intuitive and the instructions are difficult to follow.  Most of what I do is put on bills and create checks to pay the bills. I struggle to find how to easily accomplish that process.  It has many layers that you have to navigate through and most of the items are not important to me.  I had an older version that was much easier to navigate.  I think Intuit tried to give it many features losing sight of simplicity.
4,"My last version of Word was new and exciting back in 2003.  Wow, how time does fly...  This year, as I dealt with finishing a novel and formatting it for both print and epublishing, I realized that my dear, familiar Word 2003 was no longer up to the task and wasn't compatible with a lot of the new software.  I signed up for a 30 day trial of Word 2013, figuring that if I didn't like it, I'd at least have it long enough to get my book from computer to between the covers.<br /><br />Wow, what a difference! Everything I was used to was in a different place, and there was this 'ribbon' thingie, and oh my gosh I don't need another learning curve, BUT---  About two hours in on the software and I was sold! Everything is sooo much easier to accomplish in W2013 than I was used to before.  Once I got accustomed to where everything was organized in the Tabs, using the software became almost reflexive.<br /><br />A tip I put into use was putting frequently performed tasks up onto the quick launch bar, so I don't have to go through the file menu every time I wanted to open or save or print.  I have no complaints about the program, but I do miss my little canine Office Assistant buddy.  ;-)  Small sacrifice to make for such a greater amount of power and capabilities.  I especially like the enhanced Navigation/Search function.<br /><br />I looked into 'renting' Word via Microsoft's Cloud computing, but a quick bout of multiplication showed me that it was more economical for me to buy a license outright. I work on only one computer, and I don't travel, so there were no real advantages to the cloud option for me.  If I recall correctly, the Skydrive can be utilized without a subscription, but please check that out for yourself before taking my word on it.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this purchase and had no problems with downloading it on a broadband cable connection.  I had no issues installing or using it either. I look forward to maybe another ten years of happy word-processing before I have to upgrade to another version."
1,After purchase was able to review content.<br />Ended up needing a different version. Got stuck with this after purchase - no refund :(
2,"Although using Turbo Tax is better than doing it by hand. the latest version is clunky, has errors, and takes a lot of time to complete. It has gotten worse over the years so this will be my last year using it. Next year I will switch"
1,"This review is only on the mint.com compatibility which I think is key.<br /><br />So last year it was the same issue. I have 20 accounts synced in Intuit owned mint.com. On the desktop version of Intuit owned TurboTax, I attempt to sign in again on 3/19 and same as last year -- it does not work. I did perform all the updates."
2,"I found the 2013 version is no real improvement over 2010 version, at least for my use. In fact, some features are less desirable., including a small screen each time that you open your accounts, Also, the graph for month to date is cute, but really not informative.<br /> I give it an overall C."
2,"Honestly, it's just not a simple product. It looks like it's definitely capable of holding a good amount of information,  but who has the time to take a class on their financial software? Not me. It could be an awesome product if it was simplified and easier to navigate and understand"
4,Excellent!
3,"Quicken is also the best personal financial management software on the market today - easy to use, love the downloads from my banks and credit cards, decent reports"
3,This was my first time to try Turbo Tax after a nightmare with Block last year.  I found that it was pretty easy to follow along with and I saved $250 by doing my taxes myself at home!  The satisfaction of doing it myself (and a small revenge factor of not using Block) made this a good deal all the way around for me.
4,Replaces &#34;Paper Magic&#34;.  Upgraded to PDF etc.<br />Great &#34;must have&#34; for any home office.
4,"pros: free, boot-time scan, low systems resource usage, &#34;pirate speak&#34; language, out-of-date program reminder<br /><br />cons: frequent changes to the UI"
2,I am a windows user and would love to see more integration with a mobile application on Windows Phone
1,"I bought Turbo Tax because it was ranked highest among several tax programs. After filing my taxes with Turbo Tax for the first time this year I can say that it would have been easier and faster if I had filled out the forms by hand. TT may be ok if you are only filing a 1040 but if you have foreign bank accounts then TT is at times confusing, to say the least. For example. form 8938 prints in an inconsistent way, and on form TD F 90-22.1 it prints the number of bank accounts in item 14 although it's not required if you have less than 25, and in box 1 of my second page it writes (page 2 of 5), although I have only two pages filled out (I don't need Part III or IV, and I don't need to mail empty forms...) Also, while filling out form 8938 I got into an endless loop, a situation that other users have reported as well.Intuit really needs to step up their quality checks."
0,"Have used the Online Payroll service through BofA during 2013, Enhanced at $36 per month, pretty decent when it worked.<br /><br />In October 2013 we requested a change of service from Enhanced to Basic as payroll demands lowered, it didn't happen in October or November, in December they shut my Payroll Services Down, (100%), now we cannot access the 2013 Year for any records, (I.E. no payroll runs since 22nd of November, no Tax filings or W-2s).<br /><br />This is a really bad spot to be in at the end of the year.<br /><br />We have spent 20 Hours on the phone with Intuit Level I support in India, 6 hours with our Bank, and are starting all over again today,<br /><br />I have been a Quicken, Quick Books, Pro Multi User, Mac & Intuit customer since 1989 and this is their typical service level to us since Day One.<br /><br />Sce#  me once shame on you,<br /><br />I feel stupid for doing business with them every time."
4,"I have been using a computer for 20 years and this is the best program to keep all my belongings.  Serial number, Specs on Boats, Cars and a ton of other things.  Will be getting the version for my new Note 3 as soon as I comes in a few days."
2,"I upgraded from 2013 to 2014.  2013 was a better product. Getting the font size to work for me was different, I found the Larger font size worked better than not using it however the check Register and Credid card Register was way Too large. The Quicken Cloud is the only new feature I checked it out but I am happy using quicken at my desktop.<br />I feel like I got nothing for my upgrade Fee. and it is less friendly<br />James Bettis"
2,had difficulty loading.....
4,"I found the program to be extremely user-friendly, with a very clear and simple interface.  The System Snapshot feature is awesome, as this beats the default Windows Backup and Restore functions, by a wide long-shot.<br /><br />Also, I was impressed with the other features and functions of this program.<br /><br />It did not take long to install, and only required one system restart to complete its installation properly.<br /><br />In the short of it:  I will and do highly recommend this program to all of you.  It takes good and makes it awesomely better!!"
2,"Nothing fancy, but haven't noticed any problems as of yet."
0,I don't know who I have to contact.<br />I didn't receive the serial number and the activation code by itself is not working. Can anybody please contact me as soon as possible? rubia.karina1@gmail.com
4,very easy install
4,"There is an Easy mode that allows anyone to make great sounding recordings and has an expert level for those with more knowledge.  Easily finds your interface and connects.  I found the fidelity to be outstanding and the CD's produced sound great.  Be aware that 2014 has been released and contains more sounds etc. than the 2013 edition.  When you need assistance, you will receive timely and accurate assistance from the techs at MAGIX."
2,"I have been using Turbo Tax for years.  While it is fairly easy to use, I found this year to be a bit more confusing.  The information from my federal to state did not transfer properly.  Also, I specifically purchased the Turbo Tax with state, but it costs an additional $24.99 to e-file.  I don't believe that was clear in the description."
4,"I've been using this software when working in the corporate world for years and now that I've started my own business, it's the best tool my husband and I have."
3,"I bought this software to upgrade a previous version. As with the other version I can do all of the tracking of our household finances and keep to a good budget. Sometimes running the various reports with give both parties in the house a great view of where the money goes. Since I'm the spender, it keeps me in line (most of the time!). Anyway, it is a great money manager."
4,I have done my taxes using TurboTax for several years. I continue to love the product and do not have any complaints!
0,This is NOT user friendly at all. I think it assumes you have already used this before and so very little clear help .
2,I have yet to use this package but after getting it downloaded my recommendation is to buy the package directly at the TaxACT site to avoid problems with the state download that is included.  It is the same price at TaxACT and I ran into all types of problems to ultimately get the state program that I wanted.  The Amazon site only gets you the Federal download and provides no help or guidance on then getting the state download.  I ultimately got the state download I wanted but it took 10 days and several emails with TaxACT to get this accomplished.
4,meets promised in the publication
1,$40 dollars to file a state income tax return is way out of line. I paid less than that for Turbo Tax. I can have my taxes done for me for what I spent on Turbo Tax
4,Does what is suppose too. Has automatic updates and free.<br />I feel like i am protected using this software daily.
3,the daughter thought it was a very fun game
1,"Overall I like iBank 5 -- it's the only application I've found that pulls in MassMutual 401k account info, however, doing so requires a $40 'Direct Access' subscription in addition to the $60 iBank 5 purchase price.  iPhone/iPad access on-the-go...?  that'll be another $10 for an iPhone app and $20 for the iPad version.<br /><br />$110 to get started, $130 if you want Mac, iPhone, and iPad access to your data.  Annual subscription renewals and upgrade costs after that.  The iOS versions should be included with a Direct Access subscription.  The iOS apps should be Universal instead of requiring separate purchases for iPhone and iPad versions.  New iBank 5 purchasers should receive Direct Access for a greatly reduced price, and annual upgrades should also include Direct Access at a lower price.  Ideally, there'd be an iBank 'Pro' version that included Direct Access.<br /><br />Pricing suggestion:<br /><br />* iBank Standard (Mac-only, no iOS, no Direct Access)<br />* iBank Pro (Mac-only, Direct Access)<br />* iBank Mobile (iOS only, no Mac, no Direct Access)<br />* iBank Mobile Pro (Mac & iOS, Direct Access)"
4,"Saves time and money. I know a lot of smaller CPA operations use it, but you don't need to pay them when TurboTax walks you through your taxes step by step."
3,I really like avast.  I have never had a virus problem in the years I have used it.
3,I have used Quicken for over a decade and have found it excellent.  Most of the input is done automatically by uploading bank or credit card reports and quite easy.  I would hate to have to do my taxes without it!
2,"I did not receive my state download and I had to contact turbotax via chat which took awhile to describe my issues.  after several attempts, they finally got my state downloaded.<br />I also did not like the changed format as much as previous years.  It seems you cut quality of product without lowering price.  somewhat disappointed and I've been with TurboTax for years.  I will investigate another software next year."
2,"Lately there have been too many add ons with updates.  I had to accept with download a yahoo toolbar, I have enough tool bars.  It seems to be asking me every day if I want to buy something or upgrade to the paid version.  I don't remember all that with my previous computer."
3,"I like it.  It's easy to use, has a clean interface and I don't have to guess where anything might be.  Since I already am a Prime subscriber it's free so why not use it for those files that you might need to get to when your not home."
2,"You definitely get what you pay for! I purchased this because I currently pay $40 per month for 3Dream.net (which is amazing!) but that gets pretty expensive. I wanted to save some money and pay a one time fee. My biggest problem is how slow this runs when creating and editing walls. I am actually writing this review while I'm waiting for the program to reload after moving a wall. I can actually type this review faster than I can edit a wall.. but anyway, for the price it is a nice product. Just find a hobby in between loading walls. Maybe review some products on Amazon to kill time. Oh, and use the videos and online forums for help because the Start Now manual and the in-program help is an absolute waste! The program is simple but because it's explained so poorly it makes the program feel very limited until you accidentally stumble upon the really cool features."
4,"Easy, intuitive, great for the pro and the novice.  AV performance changes all of the time by brand, and by year (last year Norton was rocking it).  Anyone who follows AV tests and comparatives will know this.  For now, Kaspersky is doing quite well and the price here on Amazon is great.  Let's hope Kaspersky keeps it up for another year!"
4,HR Block tax software is just as awesome as ever.  This is the third year I have used their software and have not been disappointed.
0,The 2014 tax year version as originally sold deleted critical forms to make you upgrade to Premier version.  Very bad move on their part resulting in huge complaints.  They have recognized their bad judgement and will now upgrade for free but I am going to use TaxACT next year because I don't trust them any more after 20 years of loyalty.  They can apologize all they want but I feel like they have changed their priorities from providing a quality product to squeezing as much money from us as possible and pushing out software before it is debugged ( quicken ).
0,"I have used Quicken for years. I usually don't have problems, save for the time it requires to carefully craft and catalogue my transactions. I upgraded to 2014 for ONE REASON. I wanted to catalogue and scan my receipts on the go.<br /><br />But I can't. Under the &#34;Mobile & Alerts&#34; tab, all you have to do to get started is click the button: &#34;Get Started&#34;.<br /><br />I get the following error:<br />&#60;font style=&#34;color:#ffffff&#34;&#62;Quicken encountered a CC server-side error. Try again later. If the error persists, contact Quicken Support. </font><br /><br />Yeah. Just like that. They screwed up the software so bad it can't even format the text without making the HTML code visible. So I can't set up Mobile at all.<br /><br />So I contact Quicken, and did some research. The first error of this kind was reported to the Quicken Community 8 months ago. I would hope they have solved this problem.<br /><br />Nope. I was told through broken English via chat (because I work during the hours the call center is open), that Quicken is aware of this long standing issue and &#34;higher management&#34; is working on it.<br /><br />So my advice? Go buy 2013 on eBay. Intuit has a great reputation for the free mobile app, MINT. Maybe I'll go do that and never buy anything from Intuit again. You should do the same."
2,"Disappointing. Every upgrade I've installed--from 9 to 11 to 13--seems a little worse than the last.  Some new features I don't use & some degradation in the user interface. With Mac OSX Mavericks I had a lot of trouble saving files in PSE11 with my MacBook plugged into the big screen Display. The dialog appears with the name of the file off the top of the screen, so I can't put in a new name. If I just hit save to overwrite, the &#34;really overwrite?&#34; dialog appears somewhere off-screen as well, and I had to kill the program. Unfortunately, PSE13 has exactly the same problem.  Also, the crop tool now pops up its suggestions for crops, which covers up part of the image so I can't finish making the crop I intended to make until I cancel and collapse the parameter dialog. Also the Recompose tool seems completely unworkable if you care what size the end result will be. Printing controls are still as confusing as ever.  Sigh.<br /><br />PSE has everything I need, and far more that I don't need."
1,Not Compatable with windows 8
2,"Software rating: ★★★★★<br />Customer service: ★☆☆☆☆<br /><br />Intuit as a company should give up once for all this unethical tactics meant to rip customers off. Intuit learn from Apple, Amazon, Costco, great companies that built great reputation based on stellar customer service. Get a place in Hall of Fame, stop being Hall of Shame material.<br /><br />Activation process<br /><br />1. If you used a previously version of Payroll with your QB there is no way to activate the subscription unless you call Intuit/Payroll at 1-866-223-5562 (don't waste time, you need a new service key that is not provided by Amazon),  I don't know if you still need to do the same for a first time Payroll user, but the Amazon activation instructions are useless at this point.<br />2. Once you call them, the robot is going to ask for your EIN. Go ahead and punch it in.<br />3. After that, select option #1 (problem with your account/software) and then good luck with your waiting time, 10 to 30 min.<br />4. Once the live operator will answer, you will need to provide them with a credit card info. Unfortunately, they are not going to activate your product without doing that and here is the reason, to rip you off. Without letting you know the are going to set your subscription to Auto Renewal. Make sure at this point you let them know you don't want that unless you want to be hit with a \\""Future Recurring Charge\\"" of $374 instead of $199 in a year.<br />5. From here they are going to provide you with a new Service Key and the instructions to change it in your QB.<br /><br />Good luck!"
3,Would recommend this over others. This virus program is not intrusive or cause problems when it notifies you of needed updates.
4,lol
2,I got this to save money compare to Pure. You get many popups and your screenshots don't seemed secured. I miss Pure.
3,"This is an Amazon Verified Purchase. I found Lightroom 4 to work as advertised. One one gets the hang of using it, which is not too difficult, I was able to make changes in a digital photo that were needed. It sure beats the Adams Retouching Machine."
4,"Been using Quicken since DOS days!  Ridiculous stop on communicating with Sams Club credit provider, Synchrony Bank.  Synchrony's refusal to interface with Quicken in sophomoric!"
3,This is a basic resume format program that is easy to use.
4,I was so happy to be able to get this product through Amazon.  It is very helpful during tax preparation time.  Would order again.
1,"I am having a hard time trying to do the things I want done on this program.  As I am not very computer literate, it seems I spend too much time looking for a solution to doing what I need to do.  The help section is no help as it does not list the problem I have or I don't know what to ask.<br />Very disapointed with the complexity of the program."
3,I have used Avast Free over the years and it always seems to catch any Malware that tries to infect my System. I would give it five stars except it pops up with ads frequently. Not enough for me to try something else.
1,"Program is much slower than Aperture, which I was using before...disappointed."
2,"I do think it is important to have virus protection but since I downloaded this product, my computer has slowed down so much that it takes me 30 minutes to get to sites on the internet that before it would only take a few minutes, a few seconds to 2 minutes.  It may not be the product but my computer is not working the way it had been before I got it.  I wish I knew how to find out if it is from Norton running in the background all the time or if there is something wrong with the computer.  I don't know the fairest way to review this product.  I'm not happy with the product as it has affected the performance of my machine."
1,"Dear Bob Meighan, VP, TurboTax,<br />On the free upgrade to Premier that I had to have to do my taxes exactly as done last year, e.g. same forms, etc.<br />Seamless it wasn't.  It didn't work, the support link provided didn't work.  I spent several minutes feeding info to the VRS,  then listened to awful music for seven minutes, got a person, after 30  minutes and sharing my computer with the rep we got it working.  To add insult to injury I had to restart my computer to get the sharing session to go away.  I've also been using your product for decades.  You guys really dropped the ball this year.."

4,My Avast review says it all.... Avast slowed my computer down and did not play well with standard settings and software ... making my old standard Norton look very good and this purchase a good value!
2,"I switched my computers to Mac a little over a year ago, and have generally found Mac software equivalent to Windows in almost all arenas with the notable exception of Intuit products for Mac. I have been a satisfied Quickbooks user since the first year Quickbooks came out in the early 1990's - but the Mac products are way behind the windows versions, so I am still having to use a Windows environment to run Quickbooks for my business. I tried the 2009 QB for Mac, and later purchased the 2011 version of QB for Mac. Intuit has addressed some of the big issues, like multi-user capability, but there are so many little things that drive you crazy - like the lack of the \\""alias\\"" function of bank and credit card downloads. One can run a business with this version, but why take away features, even small ones, (on the Mac version) from almost every screen and function, as compared to Windows version. We still cannot create an accountant's copy to send to our CPA. So for now, I am back to using my Windows version in a windows environment and waiting for next year's QB for Mac release, still hoping."
2,I am a bit disappointed I ordered this antiVirus and this does not have internet security so you end up purchasing more than one to keep things protected. i used to get so much more in the past when I ordered AVG for the price. Make sure to read exactly what you are getting or you will end up spending more money.
4,Excellent!
3,"Just before last Christmas my older desktop died & I had to switch to a newer one I had, one which was never connected online. Being pretty much a novice, I contacted a local businessman (and friend) to assist me with making the changeover. He recommended the Avast antivirus software as being very efficient & easy to work with. I have found this to be true. I work with clip art and a lot of photos and I particularly like being able to scan such again after downloading to my files ... for my own peace of mind!"
3,I've used this software for over 15 years and I think it works great.  Very easy and quick to use.  I usually buy the CD version but tried the download version this year.  It was difficult to download and had to do it three times to get it to correctly download/install.
0,"Intuit tried pulling a fast-one this year (ty-2014) by quietly disabling features in its &#34;Deluxe&#34; version that we had come to depend upon, specifically regarding rental property.  This change in capability forced me to buy the Premier version.  When I got to the actual real estate section of my return, I discovered that they had even crippled some property management issues in this version and I was forced to run through another upgrade to the Investment and rental property version finish my return.<br />As a QuickBooks user, I should have foreseen this bait and switch coming!<br />I won't go this route next year."
4,Price is right!
2,"When this software ported over the data from last year's Turbotax files, it made a boo-boo.  For the direct refund, it imported the 9 digit routing number properly, but imported only 9 of the 10 digits in the account number.  As a result, the direct deposit failed, and I now await a check by snailmail.  My fault for not have checked EVERYTHING more closely, but little flaws like this still give pause. . ."
4,"Very easy to use, and (knock on wood) so far Avast has kept my PC clean from virus and malware."
4,I've recently gotten into amateur photography and I've been playing around with Google's Picasa for years.  When helping a friend recently prepare some old scanned images I felt it was time to take my dabbling to the next level.  I went through a few trial version of photo editing suites but nothing could really compare to the sheer power and accuracy of Adobe.  I'd highly recommend this product if you're ready to go to the next level of photo editing.<br /><br />Haven't used video editing too much yet but I expect good things there too!
1,The program is good and I have used it for 10+ years.  But had I known I would have to pay for the state on the deluxe I would not have bought it.<br />You did not make the financial changes clear until it was downloaded and I was ready to pick my state.  At this time I plan to try something different next year.
3,Bought it cuz it was the cheapest!!<br />Has worked so far and isn't as annoying as Mcaffee?<br />Runs in the background and uses very little of my CPU and periodically updates every other week or so.<br />Would recommend for a personal laptop but probably not for a business or work related computer.
0,"After reviewing several typing programs for our 7 yr old, we chose the Typing Instructor for Kids Platinum 5.0. We decided to use the downloadable version from Amazon so we wouldn't have to wait for it in the mail. All I can say is don't bother. It crashed our PC upon installation of the program, and has not come back yet. This is not an amateur not understanding how to download, my husband works with computer hardware and software for a living and it is not going to work. We are out $14.99 just like that because Amazon doesn't refund downloadable software. What a  crock."
1,"Purchased as I was notified that sync fuction with online accounts will not work with my previous version after April 1st - however, the function did not work with new 2013 as it downloaded multiple transactions that were previously downloaded and caused a one-hour plus reconciliation process.  Ended up needing to reload prior data file and start again.<br /><br />Subsequent downloads seem to be working - but I remain skeptical"
3,"I like it, but really don't love the hassle of dealing with finances. I stopped Quicken at Edition 9, and am amazed at how helpful Edition 14 is. It is really smart, learning to input most data for you.  I only use it to record. I don't use it to do banking or pay bills, so can't say how it is.<br />It's more user-friendly than the old one was. It is a bit hard to find things, so there's a treasure hunt for charts and other programs. Still, it's the best one on the market."
4,Prefer this over others because of eaxe of moving from screen to screen. Keep up the good work. Also lke the donation to charities options.
0,Nowhere does it say that Schedules K-1 was removed from the Deluxe version. This was a total waste.
0,"I was reluctant to upgrade from the 2004 version to 2013 Premier, but I went ahead and did.  Now I remember why it has taken me so long--upgrading Quicken is no fun.  I did it primarily to be able to download my financial information that Quicken no longer supports on the old version.  I'm not sure this convenience is worth the aggravation of putting up with it.  After all the years, Intuit should be able to produce a product that works right out of the box.  As in earlier versions, correcting errors was never easy and it's still the case with 2013.  In the next few days I'll decide whether to return it to Amazon or keep it and continue to bang my head against the wall."
3,It meets or exceeds my needs. Ample for personal / home / small business use. One note is an added touch.
0,"Quicken and my bank won't communicate, which has made the product a complete waste.  Their customer support was of no help in solving the problem."
4,"Can not go wrong for twenty bucks and lifetime.  Best product out there,"
3,Had trouble printing state form to mail in.  Used turbo tax for many years and this was the most trouble I have had. Don't change from year to year just for the sake of change.
3,"I have tried many different tax packages, and they all have limitations.  I have used H&R Block now for years without issue, and each year it gets a little better.  My primary complaints are:<br /><br />1.  When you have an error, it is sometimes difficult to see exactly what caused it.  On occasion, I have entered &#34;0&#34; on a line I should not have touched and this has required that I delete an entire form to move past the error.<br /><br />2.  Navigation and searching after the wizard steps is often clunky.<br /><br />3.  The user interface is stale.<br /><br />In spite of this, the wizard interface is very easy, the ability to bring forward previous year's returns saves hours of data entry, and overall the package is very easy.  If you have a small business or a part-time consultancy, this package is very helpful.  If they could resolve the usability issues I would give it an unqualified five stars."
3,easy download
2,"Used this program 2 yrs. ago and I was very impressed. Last year used Turbo Tax. Also noticed that I was unable to import last year's tax information. I will need to investigate further. There's not a lot of data to be imported so it's not the end of the world. Would have been nice to let the software fill in the data where needed. Otherwise, I found this product easier to use than TT at half the cost. Great Amazon price for Deluxe program."
2,because it has messed my comp. up big time with my devry college online class.  not exactly what i was hoping for.
0,Software works but customer service is non-existent
1,"QuickBooks forced me to upgrade from 2011 by cutting off my ability to load transaction files from my bank, which is a crappy marketing tactic I deeply resent. I'm not asking them to support my version, but forcing it to stop working is an entirely different matter.<br /><br />So far I've seen nothing to like better and one thing I can't believe they don't support - if you have a bunch of transactions that you want to process the same way, you have to do them 1 by 1 ... apparently there is a batch processing feature in the Accountant version but not in the Premier version. They have &#34;Rules&#34; but the process of creating them is fraught with difficulties and problems (in particular, you can't click on a transaction and create a rule for it, which means you have to look at a transaction and memorize it or write it down, then go to a whole other area to make the rule). Get something wrong with a rule and you could have a huge mess on your hands and no good way to go back. Rules also don't help you if you already loaded your transactions, only when importing them, so I find them completely useless as they are more trouble then they are worth.<br /><br />I could give 50 other complaints but would just say I find the product mediocre but there isn't a lot of choice. Another builder I know is urging me to look at Sage which does his project management and accounting, so for you builders/contractors it might be worth a look."
1,"My tax prep guy is getting too expensive, so I figured I'd try to save a little money by doing my own taxes.<br />  This is pretty good software for doing your own tax prep. However, I have a problem with the way the TurboTax folks do business. After you do your returns, you will find you have to come up with another $20 to e-file your state return. However, unless you're willing to give TurboTax your credit card number, you will be charged an additional $30. Now, the reason I shop Amazon is to avoid giving out my card number to other vendors, so this really irks me.<br />  So, unless you want to use the post office, you will have to pay more than the purchase price to use this product."
3,Easy don load and it works great.  Malware bytes is a good product.
0,Terrible! Spent 1 hr trying to activate. No luck. Serial numbers simply didn't work!!!!!!!
3,"I have the free version of Avast. I have had a positive experience with Avast, it is usually user friendly. The auto update is a plus."
0,"DON'T BUY THIS, technical support does not exist except for google research. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.<br />CAN't email out of quicken 2015, error &#34;MAIL SUPPORT IS NOT AVAILABLE&#34; cHAT ROOM SAYS 64BIT SYSTEM IS NOT COMPATABILE.  so that's most pc's out there."
0,It said it would be easy for beginners :(  NOT TRUE !!!  I am not very happy with it.  I've been using it for hrs. and I still can not get it to edit the picture easily... so far the only thing I can do is change the color of the picture and a few other MINOR things {something I could do free on my computer already} not like the program said it would do... My Cell Phone can edit photos better than this program... I would love to return it but I purchased the down load ... my mistake there !!!
3,"Very good basic software program. You can probably find someplace that does this for free, but you have to pay to e-file it. My state of Illinois let you file online and submit for free."
0,"I ordered this download today and the product does not function.  I have been using Norton products for years and never had a problem.  I even went to get help from the Norton company and followed their instructions to try and fix the program, but the Norton company could not fix this product.  I contacted amazon customer service and they refuse to resolve this issue with the Norton 360 program.  Beware when buying this product.  Amazon will not help you replace this."
0,"I have used this software for several years.  This year is the absolute worst experience I have ever had.  My Iowa State return still cannot be e-filed because of software issues requiring a mysterious state form that is not available. I have registered to be notified by e-mail when this mysterious form becomes available. Two times since registering I have received an email that the form is available.  Twice I have learned that you have not yet fixed your software, but have promised a fix by March 6th.  I read on the help page that this is a problem experienced by many users.<br /><br />Somebody at your company surely screwed-up this year, first with excluding items that had been included before, and now having a non-working piece of software.  Knowing what I do now, I would not have purchased your buggy software!!"
0,it keeps asking me to activate when I already done it several times.  I will be uninstalling it
3,"Was a turbo tax customer for several years but since they felt like raising the price on their basic version, went with H&R basic and it works great. I used to do my taxes by hand(1040) but use the software now. If I had to, I would still go back to doing by hand if H&R tries the same price hike."
1,"I only got this out of necessity for school. I detest microsoft. I have never had one issue with my mac in the two years I've had it. With in the first week of having office on it, I had to do a hard shut down because word and ppt would not stop and froze my computer. Damn you microsoft. I only gave it two stars because it did create a good product for my classes."
2,"If you are a current Quicken user faced with a forced upgrade, version 2013 is now R10 and is no better than 2010. My prior upgrades were 2004, 2007, and 2010.<br /><br />I am a user since 1988.  My working files involve 60,000 records.  Overall, I checked over 100,000 records spanning split files going back to 1990.<br /><br />I've seen a lot change with Quicken, many are painful. Periodic upgrades do make sense given its Internet centric operation because HTML, encryption, security protocols, and more, change and improve and Quicken must adopt these changes. Alas, to users most of these are invisible and behind the scenes. If they are, Intuit should detail them, because they are more important than all the advertised reporting modes in all versions of Quicken; I can and did do most of these myself, but many were eventually ruined by upgrades; so now I use only Quicken's reports and cross check its subtotals.<br /><br />Since 2010, Quicken uses the slower Microsoft's .NET framework for coding, which consumes more memory and disk space to add capability and stability. Screen drawing is also slower, but all of these are a .NET issue.  Computers should find these added needs inconsequential if these machines run games and 720p movies easily. I've not had problems with data syncing, slow response, bugs, lost data, corrupt files etc., despite my 6+ year old quad core computer.<br /><br />I've never upgraded to a first release of a new version to avoid bugs, nor overwritten a prior version. Always make a full system backup, a system restore point, validate your file, make a Quicken file backup, then do a fresh install in a new directory, then start Quicken as a virgin program then import a copy of your prior data.  To be safe I remove the data files from the PC while Quicken installs. This leads to the least, if not problem free upgrade and an effortless path back to the old version or old files should an upgrade bomb. Although I received 2013 Release 1.0, online files were available to upgrade my 2013 to Release 10, and I've had no problems with Quicken in 12 years.<br /><br />To avoid hassles with problematic license installs, I obtained the CD version not the download version as it comes without added cost, to insure I can install as many copies as I need should I have a PC disaster.  So far, I've installed it in 2 PCs easily and problem free.<br /><br />The GUI is essentially unchanged, but its noticeable cleaner, but its still far more like 2010, and clearly not worth paying for.  Many of the shortcomings of 2010 are still there, that I no longer use but remain compatible with prior versions, e.g. you can send electronic payments 3 ways, a 1990s \\""online banking\\"" interface, the checking register, or a separate checkbook app.<br /><br />One noticeable improvement is that downloads are now concurrent, rather than one at a time; so it goes faster and no longer locks up and needs a restart, as it did for even the latest 2010 version.<br /><br />The new budget app has its quirks, as have prior versions in the past, so as Quicken veteran expecting always the worst, I tweaked it to work properly.<br /><br />Over the decades, some accounts have ceased to function properly, what I did was mothball old accounts, use the account Quicken prefers and zero the mothballed balance.  This year, I've had problems with paypal imports.  This causes no short term problems for accounting, but it creates issues when analyzing patterns spanning many years.  As a last straw, you can import QIF or QFX files to accounts formatted as \\""other\\"" asset or liability.<br /><br />The new user should avoid Quicken and try many of its competitors as they have made substantial gains since 2010, e.g. GnuCash or Moneydance.  I am running GnuCash simultaneously and migrating slowly.  The only concern with competitors is direct downloads and payments, because logon credentials should have the best possible security given risk of online account theft; to date there are no reports of Quicken users being hacked and compromised, whether from their home desktops or Quicken's servers; that to me, is a potential major plus Intuit fails to capitalize on.o reports of Quicken users being hacked and compromised, whether from their home desktops or Quicken's servers; that to me, is a potential major plus Intuit fails to capitalize on."
3,Good but more expensive than last year.
0,"Title says it all.  No matter how many times I tried to download the updates, it was unsuccessful.  I did everything including call the customer support help line.  This was a fruitless effort.  I should have listened to the other reviews, but figured &#34;that won't happen to me.&#34;<br /><br />Essentially this ended up being a useless purchase and I went with TurboTax instead."
0,WAIST OF MONEY AND TIME!!!! CUSTOMER SUPPORT SPECIALIST POOR KNOWLEDGE BASE ON THE PRODUCT<br />DO YOURSELF A FAVOR  DON'T BUY THIS!!!!
0,I have been a loyal TT customer for over 20 years and shocked again by their price gouging with this new bait and switch to Premier from either Basic or Deluxe Version in prior year. I think that Bob Meighan has lost his mind in thinking customers will blindly follow him off the cliff. This should be the beginning of the end for Turbo Tax products. I remember Bob from Price Waterhouse as a good guy and do not understand where he lost his way this year. I will not purchase Premier and hereby end my relationship with Turbo Tax & Intuit after an over 20 year customer relationship.<br /><br />Remember Palm Pilot and Blackberry? Turbo Tax will be next with this arrogant thinking that they have a monopoly in tax software and can do as they please.
4,Excellent
4,"For small businesses, QuickBooks Online is fantastic!  We find it easy to use, great at monitoring your expenses and cash flow, and ties in nicely directly to our bank.  Using this program saves us a ton of money usually spent on accountants!<br />Input tools are readily available and cover a variety of needs, up-to-the-minute analysis of our expenditures and back end accounting, simple to use Invoices (that can be sent automatically to your clients!) - wonderful!!"
4,I have used Turbo Tax for four years. It recalls my last year's filing and takes me step by step through the current year. I never miss a step.<br /><br />Love it.
3,"Would like the flexibility to purchase for less than 5 devices, but a great trusted product."
1,"Having to create a microsoft account and register this product to install it is unacceptable.  If you are an IT person, or own a small business and want to install this multiple times, GOOD LUCK.  You will have to register a separate account for each install, and after 3 or 4, Microsoft will tell you that you have reached your limit for new MS accounts for that day and have to wait.  If you are a business owner, maybe you don't want each copy registered to a different MS account?  MS doesn't care.  It's in the title - Office Home and BUSINESS!  This is a terrible implementation for BUSINESS.  And to get the true business installer without all this front end crap, you have to go through their Open Licensing Program, and each copy costs almost twice as much.  Then once you start using this version, you soon realize that it's all the same stuff as before, they just moved everything around and changed the way it looks."
1,"TurboTax contains a current bug in the Wisconsin state version. If you have HSA account income, the program will not transfer the correct income amount from your Fed form 1040 or 1040A to the Wisconsin Sched I form. The Wisconsin return program will in effect, double the HSA income you report on your Federal return, causing an over-calculation error of tax due (you will pay more than you owe, if you accept TurboTax calculations). The income error can be directly overridden on the Wisconsin Sched I form, but when you do and attempt to eFile your state return, TurboTax will accept your $19.95 eFile payment, and then it will block you from eFiling the state return with the overridden (correct) income amount on Line 1 of Sched I.     This has been reported to TurboTax Tech Support and they refuse to acknowledge any issues with the program. All you receive in response is a canned email saying they don't have enough information to determine if this is a bug and you should contact Tech Support again. Contact tech support a second time, and you'll get the same canned response as the first time.     If you buy this, don't count on eFiling a correct Wisconsin return, but if you don't mind paying more tax than you should, then go for it!"
3,"Reading reviews of Quicken for Mac 2015 you would think it is not a good product.  Wrong. I've been using Quicken on Win systems for a very long time but changed to Mac for video purposes.  After a year of keeping two systems maintained so I could use Win Quicken I broke down and bought Quicken for Mac on sale as it had to be easier than trying to keep a Win system going for only one program.  I was happily surprised that Q for Mac works well for me.  I had to learn a new way of doing some things.  After four months, I now do almost all things I did on Win.  But, yes I do have some frustrations because it does not work like the old program and it takes time to figure out the new program.  Download from bank and investment works well.  It took a change in how I think, but I now get the important reports I need.  I did 2014 taxes from reports generated by Q for Mac 2015 on 2014 Win data.  No problem.  I'm glad I made the switch."
3,"For free antivirus protection, you can't beat avast! It has protected my computer numerous times. One of these days, when I'm not poor, I might actually buy it."
4,Works as advertised! Good quality!
0,"I'm not a computer nerd, but a plain Joe looking for antivirus software. After the reviews, I decided to download this product. It will not download. I've tried several times with different saved locations from this website to no avail. It keeps saying that &#34;A fatal error has occurred when parsing extracted packages. Self extract installer is corrupted. The system cannot find the file specified.&#34; My McAfee antivirus expired about a week ago and I wasn't looking to pay $40 a year for software. To my knowledge, I do not have any virus or malware that would have prevented this to be downloaded."
2,"I am the the trustee of a family trust which annual proceeds must be distributed to the trust's descendents each year.  This process can only be done with a business edition of software.  I originally used H & R Block Business program but that was a nightmare and would not fill out forms correctly.  I gave up and purchased this product which did my Federal taxes, for the trust, in less than 30 minutes however, when I looked for the State form, which is purchased through a link from the Federal, there was none available for my State of Nebraska and other states.  I spent about an hour waiting and then finally speaking with representative of TurboTax who kept putting me on hold to talk to a supervisor.  Finally she came back and told me that TurboTax does not support State returns in several states, one of them being my state.  This is something they should tell people up front.  It was very good for Federal and I will probably buy it for that next year but at least I will know up front that I will need to fill out the State by hand."
3,Is useful to give you several ideas on what different resumes should look like. I used it to update my resume to get it up to snuff for looking for a new job in the future.
4,"avast! was recommended for me by a family member.  It was simple to download, non-intrusive, and the routine reminders have been timely.  Thank you avast!"
1,Difficult to deal with and won't talk to my PC version. Makes me want to go back to pencil & ledger!
4,This software allows you to choose the type resume you want to make and then it follows with the appropriate places to input information.
0,"This free program wound up costing me over 240.00, after it told me what problems I had on my machine but to fix them you had to register the product and then it totally screwed up my computer (after I removed the anti-virus program I had on my machine).  I called customer service of Avast and they said I still had my anti virus program on even after I removed it. and I also had other major problems on my machine.<br /><br />I bought into it and they sold me a package for an additional 179.00 fee for their company to take over the computer for as long as it would take.<br />They did work on my computer and it is running somewhat better. But to get what you need prepare to spend quite a bit of money.  Of course I can't ask for a refund since the basic program was for free. I am not all that happy with this purchase and the only thing I can fault Amazon is that their should be a disclaimer like with other free gaming programs that it might cost you money on some games if you want xtra lives .."
2,"Its a decent non linear video program, but it does have some issues with processing video on the fly. If you set the video quality to manual then it the issues isn't a problem."
1,"I have been struggling with this software for several years going back several versions.  It will record the video but will often times crash.  On average everything I record either has to be recorded 2 or 3 times before I am successful, or I have to break the video down into 30 minute segments then join them together.  Even that is painful, as the program will crash while loading or freeze during processing, or give me a black screen as the final output.  That too will take several attempts.  I know they have a newer version but I am hesitant to keep throwing money at software that just doesn't seem to be working for me.  I do have a newer High end computer specifically for video editing at the home level so I don't think it is my computer.  No other programs give me any problems.  Customer support seems helpful, but the usual answer is to uninstall and reinstall the whole program.  I am looking for something better."
4,Avast does exactly what it is supposed to do and the user can adjust things as well. It is not intrusive and runs silently in the background - including updates.  Definitely a good thing to have
4,PC Matic Worked For Me so well. I really found it to be reliable and trustworthy.
1,This is not compatible with blackboard and does not include a code to enter. McGraw is worthless in trying to help with any problems.
4,Best price around - and as always a quality product. Easy download and install. Smooth and easy purchase as always.
4,It was exactly what I wanted and very easy to install.  The price was far less than retail.  Thanks!
4,"I bought this screen capture software with Camtasia a couple of years ago. Whilst I dropped Camtasia and moved to Screenflow I have kept Snagit as it is super user friendly. Easy to use, dumb proof, it allows me to &#34;cut&#34; out pictures, crop them and modify them as I like.<br /><br />I am thinking about getting the upgrade. As far as I am concerned this is by far the best screen capture software on the market."
3,"I use the free version, and even with that it seems to catch anything suspicious. Its a pretty good program I think. I don't know about its extra special features though."
3,I have been using Quicken from the beginning with Quicken-1 in 1988 or 1989. Great product! Constantly improving with capability and features. The one disappointment is that Quicken Sounds stoped working with Quicken 2010. I have not been able to get the sounds to work even with Quicken Support since 2010. I am computer technical but not an OS-7 internals expert and I don't want to be a systems analyst for Quicken. I just want to use it to run my financial life.
0,"I am nuetral aobu this download.  First of, I found a better price a week later;  I did not sweat the $4.50 savings because Amazon has saved my a few bucks during the past 2 years.  I am a noob when it comes to using this type of software, so when I tried to contact Amazon support, I was on hold for over 17 minutes.  Doesnt sound long, but when I had my 12 year old son watching me try to unzip a game for his PC, and I was on hold for 17 minutes, that was the longest 17 minutes of 2013 to date.

I WASTED MY MONEY!  I am not going to was another 17 minutes of my time to activate something that I paid for and only used three times. It is not worth the frustration.<br /><br />But... I will never use Amazon as a resource to purchase software of cyber download ever again."
3,"This software is fine for organizing your business plan, but it doesn't do it for you.  Instead of using a Word for Windows template or something like that, you are prompted to fill in the information through a sort of Interview based wizard.  You still have to do the work of creating your Business plan.<br /><br />The major benefits to the software versus a template are:<br /><br />1)  The software organizes everything for you.  You could miss portions if filling in a template.<br />2)  The software does the math for you.  Of course, you still have to come up with the raw data.<br />3)  The software will print out a pretty looking final business plan.<br />4)  If information needs to be repeated, the software will carry it to the correct section for you.<br /><br />I tried a couple of cheaper business plan products and none are as extensive or full featured as Business Plan Pro.  You get what you pay for.  If this is the first time you've ever tried to do a business plan, I would consider Business Plan Pro a combination training program/organizing program and pay the few dollars more.  If you've already started a business, you understand the value of your time versus the cost of software and will probably be much happier buying the software and saving the time.<br /><br />One more feature:  there are lots of pre-made business plan templates you can &#34;steal&#34; to create yours.  Of course, if your business isn't unique enough to require a custom business plan, the pre-made plans can still teach you what to include.  I am working on creating a business training video network (syobvideos.com) and found sample plans for consultants, advertising agencies, and wedding videography, none of which did me the slightest bit of good.  But then again, if your're creating a business, you should be unique enough to require a custom plan."
3,I've used TurboTax for a number of years now to fill out the long form and associated investment forms. I've had no problems at all. The guidance is clear and there is ample support both within the app and without to ensure a smooth tax preparation experience.
4,This thing really works! All those unwanted programs I couldn't uninstall are gone. My computer runs faster and so is my internet. It doesn't interfere with other programs I still want. And the best thing about it is it tells you when it needs to be cleaned again! I am so getting the full version!
3,"I got this to replace TurboTax. It looks like it will be just as good, and cheaper! (but I have not completed a return yet).  After more use, I have following complaints: 1. Import from bank/broker is limited to those with agreements; my broker (Raymond James) was not included - this is a killer. 2. US government interest was passed to state calculation as a 2 digit % of income rather than actual value. This is inaccurate. 3. Foreign tax calculation may not be correct (disagrees with TurboTax).  Otherwise, it worked well with no problems."

0,"Aside from all the reduction in services available using the Deluxe version (which I understand have been fixed), there is a major issue within the software that prevents the completed file (after you get to the review section) from actually finalizing/reaching the print or filing screens.  So now I have completely finished my taxes but cannot print or file them!! And forget about trying to actually contact Intuit to ask how to fix this software issue (and that's after spending countless tries uninstalling/reinstalling/repairing/trying to start new file).  There are hour-long or more wait times and NO OTHER WAY TO CONTACT THEM.<br />I have used TurboTax for at least 7 years and I have spent more time trying to complete my taxes (all of this time spent trying to resolve software issues) this year than I have in all the other years combined.  I do not recommend this product unless you have tons of time to waste."
1,Was never able to use it on my machine. turned out I have the wrong regional version. As if that was ever a thing
0,"It might work for computer geeks, but for an average user like me, it didn't work.  I have to take my computer to a professional to clear it out from where the Kaspersky has stored and restored all of my c: drive in different locations.  Probably more the user than the product."
0,"Absolutely the worst experience ever. There are many glitches in the new version. First we could not download the state related software. My wife had to be on  hold for 3 hours to get turbo tax to help. Then once our refund were drafted they could not be filed because the software said that the dependent care expense form needs to be deleted but there was not option to delete the from, tried repeating the exercise about 5 times spent 2 hours doing it, still did not work, so called turbo tax again, was on hold for 5 hours, when we got connected to the agent they said need to transfer us to another department and disconnected the phone. We very much regret having got turbotax. Never Never ever again."
1,I did everything and spent hour trying to get it to work but didn't happen. Work with stellar and they couldn't figure it out I'am running Mac OS 10.7.5.  Was able to get a refund from amazon. Might of been a quirk with my system. but wouldn't recommend

1,"Within minutes of downloading, I have found that a few of my regularly scheduled bills vanished after the install.  In trying to reset them up, I found that I can no longer split a transaction in a bill reminder.  I can select one category only.... WTF!<br /><br />This is what I found within 5 minutes.  I'll report more as I learn more."
3,"Been using it for years, east to use.  This year it felt a little off and like they were trying to upsell me more items and more aggressively this time."
1,"I purchased this as an instant download on Amazon.  The code didn't work.  I had to call the customer service, speak to someone from India about the problem.  She sent me an email with a link to tech support.  The tech support person, instead of giving me another code, took over my computer and entered a code for me... not the code I was given.  Then, since he had control of my computer, he ran the scan for me and changed settings on my computer.  He wanted me to enter the password for my email (I told him no- I didn't want to give him access to my email).  So now the program works on one computer.  I still have two more computers I was planning to install this program onto.  But I won't.  Because I would have to get ahold of tech support and give them access to my other computers.<br /><br />The program also changed settings on my computer that I'm unable to change back.  When I tried to do a system restore- shutting off anti-virus and firewalls- I was unable to.  I tried several times.  It seems my system restore does not work at all anymore.  This program also bogs down my computer- I had just installed a new hard drive a month prior to installing this and I do not have many programs on the computer.  Overall, this program is a waste of time and money.  They have shady tech support and customer service.  I'm not installing this on my other two computers."
3,This software provides a good value for its money. Easy to use and takes care of most of the common tax preparation needs.

1,"I don't know why Microsoft continues to change its products every few years. They continue to make a lot of changes, but the products aren't any better. All they've really done is create a new learning curve for customers. I don't see any NEW function in this version of MS Access, and I have problems finding and using the functions that are there. I was perfectly happy with the previous version of MS Access; know it inside and out; however, sadly it's no longer available."
1,just not much good to say about it
1,"I've had this software on my high-end Windows 8 computer (i7 processor, 32GB RAM, 360 processing speed) for about a year now, and I've only recently begun tinkering with it. Original, I needed it as a music editor, and as a tool to burn CDs. No problem there -- Roxio NXT Pro works perfectly fine, although you need some familiarity with previous Roxio software, as there's not a lot of handholding with this version.<br /><br />My problem is with the DVD and Blu-ray burning tools. I'll start with the positives: Unlike many other software programs, you have the option of actually burning the disk in HD, instead of merely using &#34;Fit to Disk,&#34; which can destroy the visual quality. Once you have the process down, it doesn't take very long to actually create your disk. And the burn time, particularly with DVDs, is one of the faster ones of all the products available.<br /><br />BUT...the Videowave software/tool used by Roxio to actually create and burn the disk is very unstable. I tried to burn footage of one of my son's plays onto a Blu-ray disk, and Videowave either stalled out on me during the disk design, or it was unable to encode the menus for the disk. I determined that the problem is that Videowave has major limits on how many movies you can prepare for burning to a disk. I was trying to burn roughly 25 short clips, totally about 1:15 hours for 10 GB, or about 40 percent of the Blu-ray disk capacity. At first, I tried to use each clip as its own movie, and this eventually worked for creation purposes. Eventually. I learned you have to save (the project) as often as possible, because there's a good chance the software will stall out on you while you are putting the disk menus together (the 25 clips resulted in 9 different menu pages -- one for every three clips -- and Videowave doesn't like that. Nor does it like it if you try to add more clips to a menu page to reduce the number of overall menu pages). But when I played the Blu-ray in my Blu-ray player, theclips weren't linked. You could play one, then it went back to the home menu and you had to select another. And so on. My DVD version worked fine.<br /><br />So, for the Blu-ray, I tried creating a pair of movies that contained all of the mini clips, and then adding chapters to each movie that would serve as access to each clip. Major problem: You end up with eight or nine submenus, and as with the movie project noted above, Videowave gets very touchy about having this many open at one time. I actually couldn't finish the project because it refused to encode the menus.<br /><br />I determined that part of the problem was that every new submenu resulted in a longer namestring for the file, and that Roxio won't encode if you have more than 2 submenus, or 12 videos, or overall names of about 20 characters (i.e. Winter Fantasy &#62; Act I &#62; Wonderful Christmastime is too long). I ended up trying to name all of the clips &#34;1,&#34; &#34;2,&#34; :&#34;3,&#34; etc., and only using two submenus and 8 videos as a test. That worked; the disk burned, but still did not play continuously in the Blu-ray player. It had the same problem before, where it played one movie clip and flipped back to the home menu. It also did not recognize any of the chapters I had inserted.<br /><br />I finally gave up and simply burned the compiled movies onto the disk without any sort of chapter links. It still won't play both movies consecutively; it finishes one and goes back to the home menu, and you have to manually select the next movie. But at least all the clips on the movies can be viewed one after the other.<br /><br />The other problem I've had is with disk menu design: The text/link insertion bites. You can't line up the various links to where they are centered until the screen thumbnail. There's a text alignment tool, but all it does is choose one of the text links and base all the others on its position. So, you can end up with an entire series of links that are too far to the right or left. You also have little control of the horizontal placement. Unless you accept the very first layout presented for the links, you end up only being able to move the lines about one inch at a time up or down, meaning you sometimes end up with lines/links that are spaced differently on the page, ruining the graphic element.<br /><br />I notice that Roxio has not addressed either of these problems with its newer NXT Pro 2 version. Bummer there; I would have considered an upgrade if they actually made it work. So, bottom line: If you want pictures or music, NXT Pro is fine. If you want video, use at your own risk, and with a great deal of patience."

3,"Like others, I have gone back and forth with this and TT.  3rd year to use this product, since I opened new LLC. I'm halfway done with this year's return and so far everything works fine.  Took a little getting used to first time, since the business part is a separate program.  Not sure if they made any improvements, but previously I had to do the business part separate and then manually enter some information on the other &#34;regular&#34; program.  Still better than TT."

4,User friendly and efficient
2,I was forced to upgrade with the threat that the Check free function of Quicken I use would end at the end of April. I use Quicken for the Bill Pay Function and as a checkbook register. I don't care about all the other functions the program offers. Most of the time they get in the way. For what I use Quicken for the upgrade gave me nothing new.
0,"I've been using iBank 5 for over a year. I had used Quicken for many years, but with my shift to an iMac I purchased iBank. i am using the most recent update. I don't know how iBank compares to other Apple finance programs, but I would give it one star. The program is not difficult but it requires numerous steps to do simple things. As someone commented it is hard to understand how to generate a simple report. The manual is not vey helpful, you spend time trying to find something and then when you find it the description is confusing. You cannot speak to a support person. You engage in online chat, which makes it even more difficult to describe and then resolve problems. My wife has a much cheaper program for Apple - it is not very good, but it is no worse than iBank5 which costs much more. In brief the program is not easy to use, it is hard to solve even basic problems, and the support from the company is lacking. I can't see any good reason to buy this program. Be sure to try out the free version before you buy this app. I'm assuming there still is a free version."

0,"Truly awful!  What started as a decent and relatively effective free antivirus has gotten progressively more bloated with crap few people want or need...  Worse yet, they are fast becoming one of the most invasive leaky programs out there!  Even with the free version you can expect them to bundle junk like \\""Browser Protection\\"" and \\""Browser Cleanup\\"" which often do more bad than good, \\""Secure Line\\"" (totally unneccessary), as well as the annoying \\""Avast Gadget\\"" which most experienced users immediately remove - after it gets installed WITHOUT your consent! (as do several of these other pieces of junkware)...  Simply Google \\""Avast Gadget\\"" to see how many people ask how to get rid of it!  Equally annoying is their \\""Grime Fighter\\"" which is loaded into your updated program without your consent, convinces newbies that their pc is filled with problems, and then asks for payment to remove it!...  Very sad to see the downward slide of what was once a nice lean Antivirus program...  I guess Greed Conquers All!  (but it is indeed foolish greed - since you will find your customer base and profits shrinking over time, Avast!)  I predict the death knell will be dealt to these people as soon as another (wiser and perhaps somewhat less greedy!) group introduces a simple and functional alternative!  --IMPORTANT!!! - BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN INSTALLING - DO NOT JUST CLICK \\""OK\\"" OR \\""NEXT\\"", ETC. UNTIL YOU EXAMINE WHAT YOU ARE ACCEPTING - THESE SLEAZEBALLS WILL TRY TO CHANGE YOUR HOMEPAGE, SEARCH PROVIDER, OR SUBSCRIBE YOU TO SOME CRAPWARE NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD WANT!!!  BaSically you just need to un-check any check boxes during the install process - and don't agree to participate in the \\""Avast Community\\"" - as it is, they collect information on you without informed consent, so be sure to use a bogus name when renewing their free \\""license\\""...  Too bad AVG has become just about as bad - use either of these with caution, and go thru every single setting - google any options you are not sure about, and if you end up with junk like \\""AVAST GADGET\\"" or \\""remote assistance\\"", \\""Browser Cleanup\\"" (you can do this on your own, just google it for instructions), or their horrid \\""Grime Fighter\\"" scam, just go to control panel / programs and features / select AVAST, then \\""Change\\"", and then uncheck the undesired garbage features... You'll probably want all of the shields, but as for \\""components\\"", I use only the \\""software updater\\"" - be sure to google any other ones to see if you need them (unlikely!)...  GOOD LUCK!    ###Update: It appears that this latest free version is quite different from the recent free one I installed a couple months ago - BEWARE!  See if a friend saved their free download (Always choose \\""save\\"" and retain the download in case a later version lets you down like this one apparently will!)... If you can get a slightly older free copy, install it with care - remember, these people aren't trustworthy and will try to load their junk as well!) - Above all else, NEVER, EVER CALL AVAST FOR ASSISTANCE - the only purpose their \\""customer assistance\\"" dep't serves is to try and scam you into buying more crap from them!... If you develop a problem, turn to Google and search for a description of the trouble to find help - so many people run into trouble, there are TONS of sources for free self-help!"

1,"I filed my taxes today, but I have never been more disappointed in the performance of my TurboTax software. I ended up having to go in and make manual changes to forms because the program simply didn't bother to interview me, or stopped interviewing me, when critical facts still needed to be established. The result was that it failed to recognize farm income that was non-participating and therefore used the wrong form, it failed to question or recognize from the address (despite having input it) what state certain seller-financed interest income was being generated in, which is critical as that information has to be transferred to that state's income tax form(s), etc. To add insult to injury, Intuit's fees were also considerably higher this year, whether for in-program state purchases, or the charges they wished to tack on to those just to e-file them. E-filing should be part of any edition price since many states have it for free on their own websites. My tax situation hasn't changed much, so these problems I encountered with the 2013 software are apparently new, at least compared to the last couple of years' programs. It was especially frustrating to have the program state things like, &#34;We will help you report the money you made from renting your farm&#34; and then when I hit the blue &#34;Continue&#34; button, it would just return to the Wages & Income menu every time instead of doing the interview or helping me do anything that needed to be done in that area. That's why I spent the money to buy the program, but instead I've never spent so much of my tax prep time in the &#34;Forms&#34; section and in IRS instructions and publications for the forms. It certainly would have been cheaper to just drag out the typewriter with paper forms if that was how I was going to have to spend my time.I hope they do a better job getting it right for next year."
1,"Have been using Turbo deluxe for years with total satisfaction. This year I was unable to deduct expenses from one little part time tutor job because deluxe no longer will allow expense deductions without moving to a more expensive TurboTax and the deductions weren't worth upgrading. Why they changed that one part is beyond me. Probably a new MBA with an &#34;idea&#34; without thinking it out. Will see what is offered next year. If they don't go back to the original Deluxe, there are too many other options out there"
2,This updated version of the software works as expected.  There are incremental improvements but nothing to really wow existing users.  The prospect of the mobile app is certainly noteworthy yet most of the reviews of the app are lousy.  Too bad!  A mobile app that works well with Quicken would definitely attract new users.

2,It's hard for me to tell if this product is good or bad.  I am finding it pretty complex and over-kill for my needs.  The price was very good so I figured I would give it a try.

2,Used this in the past. Not sure about the layouts but I'll  get use to it.  I have used other financial software in the past and quicken seems best for me.
3,It worked great. I wish I didn't have to buy the Premier version as a result of the features they removed from the Deluxe feature this year. That is why I am giving four stars instead of five.

I wish I could go back to Quicken 2010"
0,I never cease to be amazed at the endless schemes invented to force users to pay fees and/or upgrade.  I used to buy the basic version ...this year I bought the deluxe version because I had capital gains ...then I found out that wasn't good enough because I had a long term capital gain ...what a joke.  I love TurboTax but the endless ratcheting up of cost is infuriating to say the least.
2,"Typical of Intuit software, it takes an age for the software to load (and I mean a looong time). It guarantees to get you the maximum refund you are entitled to. Well if you have an NOL to carry forward or back you are on your own. It gives you no guidance on how to calculate it or how much to claim. It simply asks you to enter the amount to claim and if you look up the help feature it says nothing other than to tell you to go to IRS publications (which are totally incomprehensible and confusing). Considering that it probably has all of the information to calculate the NOL it does not even alert you to the possibility that you should be claiming it. I have used it for 4 years but I will get something else next year."

3,"The first project I bought this for was scanning old genealogical records to create a PDF book.  I needed to crop, rotate, and in some cases, reverse white-on-black scans to black-on-white.  Finally, I needed to combine all of these pages into a single PDF file., and make it &#34;searchable&#34;; so I could find specific text within the scanned pages.  It took some effort, but in the end, I was able to accomplish all of these things with the software.<br /><br />The only real issue I found was with the &#34;Make PDF Searchable&#34; feature, which OCRs the text so you can find words within the document.  The feature itself worked fine, except in some cases where I had rotated a page and cropped it, the &#34;Make Searchable&#34; function would move the crop rectangle so that part of the page was no longer visible.  I was able to work around this by using the &#34;Make Searchable&#34; function BEFORE cropping.<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy with its ease of use, I didn't have to look up much in the manual.  This is great software for a price far less than Adobe Acrobat Standard."
3,"I tried various Mac App Store programs and various trials.  There is nothing else that combines all illustration features into one program, and does so reliably.  But I understand that this is the result of years of development, along with recent conversion of Illustrator to 64 bit.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the App Store alternatives do not all handle .SVG files consistently, or even open .SVG that they created to even look like the same image!  Illustrator opens .SVG files to match how they were previously saved.  Also custom vector brushes actually work, although it takes several steps to create them, and with some limitations, versus the single step procedure in some alternative programs, but that sometimes do not work.  Illustrator actually incorporates a high resolution bitmap to vector conversion routine.  The AppStore alternatives for this were actually quite good, although Illustrator's goes to greater detail.  Any of the alternatives were good, but again, Illustrator has this feature built in, versus having to get yet another AppStore app to do this.  Illustrator has some 3D rendering abilities as well, more intuitive than stand alone 3D rendering programs, though I can not comment if the depth of this capability would be suitable to someone who does 3D work for a living.  Finally, Illustrator has strong vector based natural media tools, making it probably the best vector companion to bitmap Corel Painter.<br />On the surface, Illustrator works very intuitively, though some of the features I just mentioned were not at the top level menu and button commands, so I could not on my own figure out how to do them.  However, online search revealed copious demonstration videos and guides, many from Adobe's own website, explaining how to use each of the features I just described.  The organization of Illustrator is such that once I had gone through the video demo once for any of these features, I was easily and quickly able to find and use those features again on my own.<br /><br />One gripe, maybe minor.  Adobe's website states that this (lifetime licensed) version of Illustrator (CS 6) will no longer be updated for new features, and the newer version (Illustrator CC) is only available on a subscription basis.  While the added features of Illustrator CC did not look like anything substantial to me (again, a testament to the years of development that have gone into Illustrator, leaving it difficult to come up with anything new and substantial that would be relevant to add to the software), one can never predict for sure what might become an alleged &#34;must have&#34; new feature for illustration programs, or if a future update to Mac OS might render Illustrator CS6 non-functional, and Adobe might decide not to provide a fix for it (with a danger that no clear competitive alternative will necessarily emerge in that event).  However, Adobe also states that they have no plan to discontinue offering CS6 lifetime licenses, which suggests that they might continue to make compatibility upgrades.  Or they could change their policy in the future to make future versions available by lifetime license.  In any event, for the time being, I am happy with Illustrator CS6."
1,If you want constant reminders to upgrade the software to the newest version.. go right ahead.  There is no way to deactivate this annoying pop up window.

1,"I downloaded PSE 11 and wasn't able to get it to work on either one of my machines. I contacted Adobe via chat on several occasions for a total of almost 6 hours of online tech support. Still not working. I eventually contacted Amazon and told them about my issue via email and got an email back stating they would credit my account for the cost of the download. I would have just had them keep the money, cancel the original key code I bought, and send me the CD. They are both the same price. I did purchase the CD and installed PSE 11 from that and have had no issues since then and love the program. In case you were wondering, I would rate my PC skills as excellent. For that reason and the fact that Adobe had no resolution, I wouldn't say it was an Amazon issue. For this product I would recommend getting the CD."
2,"Upon installing this on my wife's computer, I found that some websites do not work well with Internet Explorer that worked fine with our previous AV, Kaspersky.  Some of them refused to respond at all and Norton gave me no notice of what to do about it.  After consulting with fellow computer nerds, I switched her browser to Firefox and was able to make everything work as before."
0,"This is a sad day, I have been a quicken user for Windows or Mac since the 1990's. With the latest forcing of an upgrade to keep functionality and the poor user reviews of the Mac 2015 version I am saying goodbye to Quicken. I took the risk on Quicken Essentials when it came out. I had to keep using the windows version to manage investments.  hoping to get away from running dual systems to manage finances I hoped quicken 2015 for MAC would be more on-par with the widows versions. With the very poor reviews being reported I do not see spending $65-$75 for a minor upgrade to the application. I will be moving to MoneyDance or iBank as they at least see the need for a single application to manage your money."
4,"Easy and effective.  if I need tc, I can download again.  One less disk to keep track of!! Good to go."
1,"Follow-up:<br /><br />The comments further down, for 3 stars, indicate that customer support is willing but weak. I'm now taking a star away because of my latest support experience.<br /><br />In the continuing effort to get all of the effects included with the package to work on my machine (more than I originally thought), I've been going back and forth with email support.  It's clear that their Level One people are following a script pretty much unrelated to the reported problem.  But the latest interaction included a full set of instructions requiring me to manually uninstall the product - INCLUDING MANUALLY EDITING ABOUT 16 ITEMS IN THE WINDOWS REGISTRY.That is a suggestion bordering on insanity, even for a programmer - which I am. It's courting absolute disaster for your computer and its installed programs.<br /><br />When I complained about this, their response was to ask me if my problem was solved.  Eventually, they closed out the problem rather than escalate the issue to Level Two.<br /><br />So be aware: there are some not-necessarily fatal bugs that you can work around.  But customer support for addressing those bugs is completely ineffective.<br /><br />==================<br /><br />I got the download version of this. It has a large number of very nice features, and the multi-trim feature blows its competitors away.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />I installed this on a brand new instance of Windows 7, 32 bit. Right away I ran into a problem that speaks for poor quality control: a bunch of their sample clips  - their own sample clips - would not play on their preview screen.  And some of their transition effects - their own transition effects - crashed their program when I tried to preview them.<br /><br />But more important than the poor quality control is the ineffective customer support via email. They responded quickly to my concerns, but their response consisted in a form letter: do X, Y, and Z - even when X was incompatible with (indeed impossible with) Windows 7.<br /><br />The next go-round - again, handled quickly - was another form letter suggesting other irrelevant things to do - again showing that my complaint had been read only in the most cursory fashion.<br /><br />I'm an early adopter in this case - something I try to avoid.  I'm sure that the problems I'm seeing will eventually occur for enough people that Corel will notice and fix. And I would not recommend a different Windows-based editor.  But be aware that this is still a young product."
4,Since I'm in Indonesia and really needed Office I am very grateful that it downloaded smoothly and its worked really good.  Thanks!
2,"After the first few income entries, the program would not add anything past line 44 or calculate the tax at the bottom of Form 1044. After a few more income entries, the program worked properly.<br /><br />  Prefer the disc to down load."
1,"I upgraded to iBank 5 from 4, and expected a nice smooth ride. Started having issues with what I think is a bug as soon as I began to work on my data. Couldn't save anything, so there's no point in continuing, and now I can't close the document either or else my changes will be lost. Worst of all, though, is their support hours are ridiculous.  I'm working on taxes over the weekend at what I think would be considered Tax Time for most people, I'm on the west coast, and they're closed by 1pm PT because they're east coast and only work 10-4 on weekends! Same goes for their hours on workdays, which are 9am-5pm ET. This seems not to take into account those of us who have full workdays and can only work on taxes/finances in the evenings or on weekends. It would be one thing if this was a brick and mortar store where they sold widgits, but it's a software company and these hours are not realistic for customers who need answers right away. At least their live chat should be open for a longer period. I've lost all the time I'd set aside today to work on taxes and this puts me in a huge bind, which makes me angry.  If this company wants to be taken seriously as THE finance software for Mac, they need to offer better support for their customers."
2,Pretty much the same as last year just more money
1,I bought this program thinking that I would have a long established easy program to manage my finances. I find it cumbersome and that several of my accounts will not download to this program. If I did not wait so long I would upload it back to Amazon. The kicker is that they want to sell me a manual for additional cost. In this case I am cutting my losses and using my MS Spreadsheet.
1,"Buyer Beware !!<br />I have been using TurboTax for many years.<br />I was a bit distracted by learning that I had to get a higher priced version this year<br />because TurboTax moved Schedule C from the Deluxe version to the Home and Small business version.<br />so I wasn't really paying attention to every little detail on two pages of pictures, deals, descriptions, reviews, etc<br />I ordered this version and was promptly notified that The Amazon Downloader (whatever that is, not sure of the exact name)<br />only worked on Mac OS 10.5 or higher.  Fine I thought, I have 10.6.8.<br />But after using the Downloader I discover that TurboTax itself needs 10.7.<br />So I am out $85 dollars as there are (reasonably) no returns on Software Downloads.<br />I went back to the description page and indeed way down at the bottom it mentions the 10.7 requirement.<br />For items where the buyer is out-of-luck like this<br />The Operating System requirements should be displayed much, much, much more prominently"
1,I have this set to extrapolate data from my checking account and Paypal account.  It seems to continuously report the data in duplicate making it useless.  Spend the extra money and buy quickbooks if you want a decent program.  It downloaded quickly and was an easy purchasing transaction so I gave it a couple stars.
1,"I thought this would be a viable solution for days when I've typed so much my fingers hurt. Sadly, the software seems to have issues with speech impediments and accents. I'd been warned about accents, but didn't think that'd be an issue for me since I don't have one. I do, however, have a slight lisp if I'm tired, and found that I spent a lot of time correcting words and my average words per hour went down, not up."
0,If I can't use it what good is it??<br /><br />And like so many other products of its type the registration process is a cluttered mess<br />and  all topped off with a complete lack of customer support.
3,"I'm not going to speak to the product itself (although I prefer earlier versions of Word). I want to say that, for me, purchasing, downloading and installing were not difficult. I did use the library's wifi, and even on that fast connection, it took somewhere around an hour, I think, so don't expect it to go quickly. You do have to either already have, or acquire during the process, a Microsoft account. If you already have that, it's just following the directions and being patient. If I encounter any of the mentioned issues with the program ceasing to work properly after a certain amount of time, I will edit this comment."
2,The fact that I was lead to believe that I would be able to efile my state taxes for this price may just drive me to Tax Act next year.  I didn't mind spending the extra $25...It just would have been nice to know it up front.  Booooo.
1,"Long time Quicken User since 1995. I generally upgrade about every other year. Thanks to a lot of warnings online, I created a sandbox of my files in a Virtual Machine with Quicken 2011 and upgraded to Quicken 2013. For the first time ever, it seems to have messed up transactions, transaction totals etc. I am on Windows 7.<br /><br />Because I had adequate warnings from other users here, all I had to do was blow away my sandbox VM and go back to my original and all was well.<br /><br />Quicken needs to look at their development and QA processes and how something that significantly undermines user confidence like this could even get released! Rapid Development Processes does not mean Poor Quality is Ok.<br /><br />This is NOT a STOCKING STUFFER for 2013....  Perhaps 2014 if the kinks get worked out"
4,good
1,"My older version was very robust, bever crashed. The 2014 version locks up or crashes alnost everytime I email a proposal or invoice, and there is no fix in the help stuff."
0,"I purchased and Installed it on my one-year new iMac, to work on a Word document that I need to edit.  It immediately prompted for a &#34;update&#34; right after I tried to open the word, which I did.  The first word document I opened has half of garbled stuff. It did something to my system that screwed up my Pages functionalities, as well. My Pages is no longer working, all Pages files are showing garbage prints.<br /><br />I have been an Amazon member since 2003, this has yet to be the first purchase that I cannot &#34;return&#34; or do anything with it.  The damage is serious."
3,Good product and good price. Background scans result in emailed reports. Auto-fix or manual fix is your choice. Nitro downloader included in package.

1,"Hard to use.  I have been a windows user since 3.0. But for the last few years I have been using an ipad.  Going back to a desktop has been painful.

I have about 8 hours into this and have about 4 min of video.<br />One big problem that pissed me off, I dumped hundreds of videos and photos that are in order of time and date.

1,The work put into this upgrade was not up to the standards I expect from Inuit. I have been using for quite a few years but only upgrade every few since Intuit doesn't offer a decent discount for loyal users. It's the same $59.99 each year to upgrade.  I have bought new in stores for cheaper than what I get as upgrade price being loyal customer.
4,Purchase was quick and easy and worked immediately. Downloading was painless; all sections of QB Pro 2014 worked!<br />Thank you again
4,Adding Adobe Lightroom 4 to my workflow allows me to streamline my editing tasks. I find myself having to use photoshop alot less.
1,While I've used Quicken Products for almost 20 years this update misses the mark on its ad claim of much faster download of financial accounts...in point of fact its much worse than all prior versions with some accounts not downloading at all. Quicken's blog site talks of awareness of problem but with no relief after months of pain. I'd like to go back to Version 2011 thank you and to think I had to pay for this lesson!!
0,"Just got a mailer from Intuit, announcing that Quicken2012 online capabilities are being disabled, and I need to upgrade to Q2015. In the user support forum, I posted this:<br /><br />&#34;What right do you have to disable features after selling a product? Outrageous! When I bought Q2012, there was no indication that you would disable key features after a few years. I bought Q2012; I did not rent it. I will be watching for a class action suit to join.&#34;"
3,"We went through our taxes relatively fast, however there were items that caused a little confusion.  Overall, however the experiance was reatively painless."
4,"So far, I have no complaints about this program.  It is helping me brush up on my Spanish in my free time.  It is easier for me to learn while both listening to a professional speak Spanish and also following each lesson visually on my monitor.  Not a pricey purchase either."

0,"I have been a loyal TurboTax customer since sometime in the 90's (I threw away the floppy disks a long time ago, and I don't recall the earliest date, but it's been a long time.) I am angry about the deliberate disabling of critical features in TurboTax Deluxe. No Schedules C, D, or E. In the past, the product was functional, even though the &#34;Premier&#34; version provided more help and guidance. That was extra functionality and if you needed it you could buy it. But in Deluxe you got the forms, the basic help info, the IRS docs, the final review checking, printing, and e-filing. So if you knew what a schedule C or D was (it's not that hard) you could file your taxes.<br /><br />Now in the name of &#34;consistency&#34; this has been taken away, and if I want to file my taxes using TurboTax I need to buy something almost twice as expensive. I have read the words about how Intuit labored over the vital need to be &#34;consistent&#34; and yes indeed after their stressful labors they did indeed cripple the product and they will try to force people to buy the much more expensive version. Please be honest -- just step up and say you decided to charge a lot more money. Instead the official Intuit response sounds like we're supposed to feel sorry for how difficult it was for them to decide to raise the price.<br /><br />Raising the price is something I would object to but it's just a price increase. It's the disingenuous explanation that shows such contempt for the intelligence of customers which prompts me to give a one star rating, only because it's not possible to give zero stars.<br /><br />Intuit used to be known for making products that pleased customers and surprised them -- in a positive way. It's sad to see the company's current attitude.<br /><br />**UPDATE -- IT'S EVEN WORSE** OK, I'm angry but I need to do a draft of my taxes for planning purposes prior to year end. So I bit my lip and looked at ordering the Premier version. Even in the high-priced Premier version, Schedule C is crippled -- limited to $100 of deductions in a couple of expense categories. I.e. only good for a tiny hobby business, and maybe not even that. So now having forced me to Premier, even that high priced product is useless to me. Intuit, what is wrong with you people?<br /><br />Everyone who reads this: Maybe you will have to buy the product in order to avoid the trouble of converting to another product. But even if you decide to buy it, please take the time to register a negative review here or at other product review sties. You don't have to write as long a review as I did -- just a couple of sentences and click on 1-star. Even if you have a rational reason for giving in to Intuit's extortion, maybe the negative reviews will cause other customers to choose other products. Maybe someday Intuit will be forced to care about customers.<br />Help other cus"
2,Works well on my windows 7 pro computer. I wanted to install it on my old computer with Dial-up service.  It does not work with dial-up.  This should be noted on the ordering page.
3,"I have used the Avast free edition for several years and have never had a problem with a virus or malware while using this product. It does seem to have become a little more bloated and I suspect it is slowing me down now and then but overall it is still worth it, and in my opinion vastly superior to the costly subscription plans from Norton or McAfee.  I haven't tried the purchased edition but if you want even more protection then that might be a better option for you."
1,The Mac version of quicken is not nearly as good as PC version.  Save your money and Find another option before purchasing
0,Not good! The program downloaded fine but then has caused continuous headaches. I have had to download at least a half0dozen times. Ughhh!! Not my cup-of-team.
4,"I used to do ALL of my husband's business books MANUALLY.  My accountant tried for years to get me to convert to a computer.  I finally did 10 years ago, to Quickbooks, and am forever grateful for the TIME I have saved, not to mention all the benefits of the program.  My absolute favorite thing about QB:  I can connect over the net with my accountant, who is QB certified and helps me with all of my QB problems!  No more making appts, having to have her drive to our office to help!  She can connect virtually anywhere and help me anytime!    I love QB and am always quick to recommend the program to friends or acquaintances!"
4,"For the price and for what I use it for on my iMac, it is worth it."
1,"Your constantly pressing to get money from upgrades and more recently stopped avast from working, When I called your service # you wanted 198.00  to fix my computer. There was nothing wrong my computer.!"

0,"Cyberlink hasn't produced a solid video editing software variant in YEARS!!  The last stable version I used was Cyberlink Power Director 8 I think.<br /><br />I have an HP Pavilion Desktop computer with an AMD A10 Quad Core Processor, 10 GB of RAM, and 2 GB of Dedicated Video Memory, and this program STILL lags up and crashes on me.  Simple tasks involving dragging and trimming video in the timeline are very ill responsive and well,...the entire program lags up and freezes when performing even the most mundane tasks.<br /><br />Save your money, and find a better video editing software that actually RUNS SMOOTHLY."
1,"I have been a PC user for many years and have used Quicken for 30+ years. I grew with them thru the years and have always had good results.  I converted to Mac and purchased Essentials to transfer my info from the PC. My data converted over fine but the program would not talk to my bank. After many phone calls the end result is that the bank does not support Essentials for Mac because it does not support the latest security requirements.  Intuit needs to develop \\""2014\\"" for the Mac, as this version for the PC supports all the security requirements. Additional note: Kudos to Amazon, the return was painless when the product did not meet my needs."
1,"Installation took 3 attempts.    It crashed everytime I attempted to restore my 2009 pro backup of my books    The help window causes java script exceptions to be reported.    I haven't needed the new features.  Stability is more important than bling.    I only upgraded because my bookkeeper's system was 2011 Pro.  On the whole, I'd have spent less time converting files with them once a month, than working round all the issues in this release.    My OS is Windows 7 Professional.  My browser is IE.  I keep both fully current with updates and patches.    Very disappointed with intuit.  Recommend you postpone upgrading until they've shipped a significant bug-fix package."
3,Still ok
2,"I tried the open-source Inkscape before buying DrawPlus X6. Inkscape's interface is a mess, and it can't open EPS files, which is a necessity for me. (As for Illustrator, it's too bad my old Illustrator 8.0 won't install under Win7 -- I can't justify $699 for CS6 or the subscription model of CC.) DrawPlus is fine on drawing tools, but its text-handling tools are terrible -- less flexible, in fact, than what you find in Word. I can't, for example, figure out a way to do manual pair kerning, baseline adjustment, or any of the other similar manipulations one would expect from an illustration program. What's really weird is that DrawPlus includes a tool for entering text in large blocks, but then lacks anything but the most basic controls over the text's appearance.<br /><br />So, if you're going to set all your type in another program and need only a vector editor, I guess DrawPlus will work. But, if that's the case, give Inkscape a try and save yourself the money."
2,"Every time Intuit &#34;upgrades&#34; Quicken, I hope and pray that they will actually improve it. But no, their only reason for &#34;upgrading&#34; is to break my connection with my bank and hold me hostage to get it reconnected. Over the years, Quicken's reports remain clunky, hard-to-read and utterly un-customizable. There is no third heading for non-income items: if you enter something as a deposit, it goes under &#34;Income&#34; no matter if it's a refund, a gift or a transfer from another account that isn't listed. Don't get me wrong, Quicken is useful -- but unfortunately it has outlasted the competition thus is not motivated to make its product more user-friendly. Investors should buy their stock since they sell a lot of units and put no money into improving their product. Gotta be a money-maker."
4,"I have had Norton for 2 yrs now.  Great support.  I used this back in July when Amazon Prime Movies Starlight downloaded a virus on my computer with an ad ware that was unremoveable.  I had tech support remove it for me as I couldn't do it and Norton couldn't detect it as a virus.  It updates in the background and is active if something is launched that shouldn't be.  It detects if something is okay prior if your downloading something from your computer.  We all make mistakes, but this is certainly a great guardian since I do online business with E-commerce as a living."
4,Got out tax return deposited into our account in less than two week.  Would highly recommend.
0,"After five years of using TurboTAx....I give up. The software has changed. It's very confusing. They've changed the way it works. I can't explain exactly what they did, but comparing it to the past years I've used it it does not calculate or pull the same reports as it did before. After spending $70 bucks and 5 hours time I scrapped it and called a CPA to do my taxes. Totally frustrated. They lost a customer."
4,Been using this software for years and have never had a problem.  Downloading it from Amazon saved me $10 off of any price I've seen anywhere else.  I recommend it highly.
2,"I have windows that pop up, and though avast blocks them, there does not seem to be a way to eliminate the threat."
0,Avoid QuickBooks. Just don't use this software.
0,"i did not order this,  i was hacked"
0,I'm a K-12 public school teacher. I sent my credentials to Microsoft via my online account. They never responded and wouldn't approve my use of Office 365. A huge company like Microsoft with billions in assets should be ashamed not to support K-12 teachers. Amazon graciously  refunded my money. Microsoft needs to support K-12 teachers and not just target University Students and Academia. K-12 teachers are in the trenches and responsible for educating the up and coming generation that will be using (or not) their software.
0,"Hate it! Would give zero stars if I could.  With the $$$$ Intuit charges, couldn't they provide more answers to my questions, especially for filing in state; CA.  This is for corporations, should be more thorough for the corporation price it charges.  Had to do my own research on a particular issue for hours, then bought another brand's software and .  If you know your tax laws, you can buy cheaper alternatives."
2,"I have used Turbo Tax for quite a few years and have always been completely satisfied with the results.  However, this year I was less then pleased. The Federal return it did fine.  I moved last year so had to file in two states.  The first state it did completely wrong.  It's the state I have lived in for over 20 years therefore had plenty of background from previous years.  Luckily I reviewed the filing before submitting it and corrected the mistake.  Interestingly, even when I corrected the mistake, Turbo Tax  didn't raise a fuss.  Apparently it liked the return the wrong as well as the correct way.  I purchased the second state from Turbo Tax for $40, only then did it tell me that it couldn't totally complete my return for that state.  I would need to go onto the state website and download some additional forms to complete, then file manually.  Frankly, if I had known I'd need to do all that leg work I would have saved my $40 and done the entire state return myself.<br />Not sure what's up with the software this year, but it needs an overhaul."
4,"Have been using Norton for years on my, sibling's, parent's, in-laws PC's - no viruses, no complaints."
4,"Quick and easy as usual! Works great if you have simple tax situation - mortgage interest, charitable giving, etc."
3,This software is excellent. I have used it for years and they improve it every year making it easier to follow and use each year. I did have one problem. I could not get the software in sync with using the internet to download the most recent version nor could I &#34;efile&#34; because of that lack of connection.<br /><br />Overall - good
2,slows down my internet..wont be buying
4,I have been using Internet Security for years now. If you have issues you can call and get a person on the phone to walk you through your issue. Not like the Nortons of 2002 because it uses very little resources.
1,"I've been using Quicken for several years and was forced to upgrade to maintain online updates.  I would say i did not notice any helpful improvements in this version based on the way i use the software.  A fun new feature is that it randomly drops integration with several of my accounts and i have to deactivate and re-activate to get connectivity again.  That does not always work, so i will have to long periods of time without correct data.  i have contacted the financial institutions, and they say this is a recurring issue with Quicken.  I have tried to contact Quicken, but trust me this is a useless exercise.  if you are lucky enough to talk to a human, it is likely you will know as much or more about the software than the human.  I really wish there was a decent competitor to this software in the marketplace. :("
3,"We always use Turbo Tax to do taxes, worked great, no problems! Best price I could find after doing a search throughout different sites."
1,"Syncing problems moving my info from qb online to desktop.  They said the problem was the software does not work with current programs such as internet explorer 9, 10, or 11.  And will not work with google chrome.  It has been almost a month and they have helped resolve most issues after hours on the phone with support.  It is not a plug in and play."
2,"Overall an acceptable product.  2012 was my first attempt completing a Trust (1041) return.  One large issue I had was that a very common form, 4835 (Farm Rental Income & Expenses) wasn't included even though it is in all the other Turbo Tax products.  When I pointed this out TT incorrectly advised me to use Schedule F instead.  I suggested to Turbo Tax that this form be included in future additions but they didn't seem all that interested and I'm betting it isn't in the 2013 addition either but I haven't looked yet.<br /><br />Another suggestion I submitted was that if you could right click on a line and type for example &#34;See Statement 2&#34;, would be very helpful.  I ended up typing these in with a manual typerwriter before mailing my paper copy.<br /><br />I'm going to download the 2013 version from Amazon and will post later how it works.<br />Sam"
4,"Quickbooks Online is a fast, foolproof way for me to invoice clients, keep tabs on my expenses, and make tax time much easier."
2,"From having visited the Alsatian part of France and being acquainted with native \\""Elsaesser\\"" I might suggest it to be easier to become first fluent in German and then enjoy yourself teasing out of the dialect the words you're familiar with. If I'm not mistaken, Alsatian is a Main, Frankish German dialect sort of like Luxemburgerisch. Natives of the upper Bavarian province of Ober Franken speak a similar dialect.<br /><br />I love Alsace & Lorraine. The food is awesome, the wine flows and the people are warmhearted. Spend a couple of weeks there living amongst the Elsaesser and you will pick up the language.<br /><br />No - I don't own this on line learning aid. If this is what you need to learn Alsatian, by all means buy it."
2,"They have my account screwed up and after and exchange of  10 support tickets, it still is. The antivirus is good however,"
3,Good Program. easy to use
0,"First, let me clarify that I'm a software developer with 20+ years of experience.  I've also been meticulously managing every penny of my money for decades.  Back in the 90's I used Quicken.  When the software became riddled with simple bugs that were painfully obvious and never fixed, I became a beta tester for Quicken.  I found countless issues, but they were never fixed.  Finally, I switched to Microsoft Money.  I LOVED Microsoft Money.<br /><br />Three years ago, I was forced to go back to Quicken.  And guess what... it's STILL riddled with bugs and usability issues.  Tonight is only one more of many, many instances where Quicken has corrupted itself and I've had to spend days cross checking my data, finding issues and cleaning up the mess.<br /><br />Tonight, before switching to 2014, I carefully cleaned up my file, did a year-end copy, reconciled all transactions in all accounts, verified my file for errors and deleted any unused accounts.  Then I took a screenshot of all my account balances and projected balance graph.  Then, after upgrading and opening my existing file with no changes, the projected balance graph is completely off and shows that my account balance will go negative soon.<br /><br />SILENT CORRUPTION IS THE CARDINAL SIN OF ALL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT BUT IT SEEMS TO BE JUST FINE WITH QUICKEN.  They are so busy adding new buggy features that they won't take the time to make things bullet-proof first.  Just read the other reviews and I think you'll agree.<br /><br />If you are going to create a captive market by purchasing rights to bank updates, at least keep from torturing the people who pay good money for your software."
2,"It eventually did the job, but could have been a lot easier. The main problem I had was the disconnect between the claim that it would ensure the biggest savings, then not testing the other options when I went with their &#34;recommended settings&#34;. It gave me a $5000 underpayment with their recommended setting. I then had to go back through and toggle settings one by one to find I didn't owe anything. It's certainly not as intuitive as they would have you believe."
4,I love the fact that I can download the software and I don't have to wait for it to come in the mail.  TurboTax always delivers in allowing me to complete my taxes in an easy and efficient fashion.
1,Was not pleased.
4,I use these programs every year. The download was easy and quick. No problems at all. I recommend it to anyone who prefers not to pay someone for something you can do yourself.
3,"It took a while to complete, but the program made writing our wills relatively easy and straight-forward.  There are quite a few steps, so you need to set aside a few hours and gather all of your financial information, names/addresses of executors, etc.ahead of time."
2,Not as great as I hope it would be.  When transferring to dvd the quality was not that great.  It just descent.
3,Taxes are done not as hard as I thought.
1,When converting pdfs to excel it doesn't give you the same flexibility as an older version I've  used.
4,Perfect!!! and Fast!!!
0,"The last thing I did on my computer was install this software; it keeps popping up with an error message &#34;need to shutdown and complete installation&#34; but after several times of doing this I realize it is never going to completely install, because my Admin password doesn't work since my user profile was corrupted as a result of installing this software.  Now AVG states all functions are working (green check mark) except the all important one - protection while surfing the internet.  Granted, my computer is six years ancient."
1,"I bought the hard box copy and had no issue installing the business and personal software on my Windows XP computer.  I did the S-Corp Federal and State return without much problem although it was not intuitive to use.  My S-Corp has been hiring an accountant for the previous 4 years to do taxes, so I studied what she did and was able to finish the return without much problem.  However, if I had no knowledge of how to do S-Corp return, the software by itself was not enough to explain amortization and depreciation.<br /><br />On the personal tax return.  I found a major bug in the state portion.  I have rental properties, S-Corp income, personal wages, some investments, sold and bought a house, did some energy improvement construction, etc.  It wasn't complicated, just a lot of items and I didn't want to miss any deductables.  I used this software to make my task easier.  While I found the Federal was working ok, the state portion had major problem.  I double check the Federal and my manual calculations had the same result.  I printed the State return and closed the program.  The next night, I opened the program and found that ehe Federal return refund figure was the same but the State was about $20 more.  I didn't do anything to the file and I went through all data input comparing to the hard copy I printed.  All figures are the same but the refund amount was different.  I worried and redid the State return.  Strangely, the refund went up $200 after that with the same figure.  I printed it out and did it manually and found a major error in the program tax return.  I have 2 children and the State only showed 1 while the Federal showed 2.  The problem is I cannot manually changed it in the State return because it used the data I input in the Federal return.  However, the Federal showed correctly.  So I went the Federal portion and uncheck the boxes next to my kids and then recheck the boxes.  Now the State shows that I have 2 dependants and the refund went up another $300.  I printed the State return and did not see anything wrong this round.  I have lost all my confidence in this software and while it cost a lot less than Turbo Tax, I am going to switch to Turbo Tax next year since I used Quickbook and Quicken.  I always double check with manual calculations which kind of defeat the purpose of using these DIY software, however, I like the aspect that it copies the depreciation information from the previous years which saves me time to dig up what I depreciate the year before.<br /><br />Not being intuitive is not a very big deal to me but inaccurate return is just not accceptable.printed the State return and did not see anything wrong this round.

0,"Trying to do a 1041 return for a Trust return.  Got into an never ending error loop.  When you click on the link to correct the error, it comes back with two more new errors.  Customer support was of no help except to tell me there was an update scheduled for today and to tell me they are having problems with this form.<br /><br />Hope they get it fixed, otherwise this program is useless for a 1041 filing."
3,My husband and I both decided to try Avast Free Antivirus last year and we have been very pleased with the product.<br />It is updated automatically and sends alerts to us when potentially harmful events are occurring. We have found it just as helpful and reliable and some of the other brands we have paid for in the past.
1,"After successfully using Turbo Tax for a number of years, I was surprised by this latest version.<br />This year:<br />---It couldn't &#34;find&#34; the previous years install so as to prefill and provide comparison.<br />---It couldn't update.<br />---It jumped around within the various categories, as opposed to following a logical sequence.<br />---It didn't always bring me back to the same place when I pressed the same button.<br />These results were from the actual disk being loaded into a Dell XPS running WIN 8.1 with 12 Mb of RAM. The A/V was turned off as was the VPN during install.<br /> It's like the original project manager retired last year and the new guy tried to innovate or cut cost or both."
4,"There were a number of reviews that I read that talked about issues people had with the download or the program itself.  I had none of that.  I am running Windows 8 but that didn't cause any issues.  Download was very quick and within less than 5 minutes (I did the update), I was using the program.  I have been using the program now for a few hours (total time) and it seems to work without any issues.  Seems to be very much like previous years.  I have been using Turbotax now for many years and again I am happy I purchased this program."
4,I like it. thank you very much
1,"I got this program because my new tax prep person came up with some ungodly sum I supposedly owed the IRS and I figured there was no way I owed that much; it amounted to about a quarter of my net income for the year, and it's not like I'm that far above the poverty line, quite frankly, so I figured something had gone wrong.  I thought if she couldn't do any better than that surely I could just as easily do it myself.  Turns out the only way to get worse results than I got with her was to use TurboTax.  If I'd used it to file my taxes, Uncle Sam would've wanted over 30% of my net income rather than 25%.  It was at least a somewhat useful tool in figuring out what basis the government uses to figure out tax liability, so it was vaguely worth getting, though more as an educational exercise than anything."
4,First time using publisher for a high school musical program.  It's very easy to use and picture quality can be kept.
1,"I have used Quicken faithfully for many years.  I started getting a message that the online services would expire on 04/30/14 forcing me to upgrade.  Quicken 2014 is much slower on my machine,  I actually had to restore from a backup due to the program locking up when trying to accept transactions (which is now incredibly slow).  I realize systems are getting faster but this application seems to be going the way of some of the anti-virus solutions (big and slow).  I have always been an intuit fan but 2014 was a step backwards for me."
1,"I've had to make some major leaps of faith with both IRA conversions but researching online and have been unsuccessful with 1099-B imports.  To be fair, there seem to be many users frustrated with the Morgan Stanley lack of import feature and unclear account report with short-term covered, long-term covered, and uncovered securities.  Apparently, uncovered securities (for 2014) are not reported as they were before 2011.  Not being a tax lawyer, it is difficult to determine how to import these transactions.<br /><br />Knowing that I was having difficulty importing, I decided to give it one last attempt at putting every transaction into software, but was not able to find the fields.  I did talk with both Morgan Stanley and Turbo Tax to no avail.  This just doesn't seem to be an option.  I bought Premier to handle these types of transactions,  but will end up at a tax lawyer this year and will likely abandon turbotax after several years of successful usage.<br /><br />Good thing is that I will have the lawyer look at my past filings to see how accurate TurboTax has been."
0,"I've used Quicken for many years prior to switching to Microsoft Money and then when that was discontinued switched back and have been using Quicken since 2010. In all those years and even after coming back, I've never had any problems. I purposely avoided upgrading to 2013, 2014 due to the numerous issues with those products that I read about but this past year I was forced to move to 2015 to continue use the online banking features. And now I've lost all my data using Quicken 2015.    The other night I was doing a simple balance adjustment when Quicken 2015 crashed. And by crashed I mean \\""just disappeared\\"". Having had this happen previously with this version, I restarted the program and entered my password for my data file. At this point Quicken 2015 reported that my password was wrong. Fine, I typed it again. Still said it was wrong. Finally I realized there was something wrong.    Went to Quicken Support and downloaded their Password recovery tool. That failed.    Contacted support and was quickly escalated to their data research team. So much for that - after uploading my file, received an email that my data file was UNRECOVERABLE with the recommendation to either go to a back-up (which has the same issue for up to 1 month back I can see) or start a NEW data file. The support data research team indicated this was a hardware/software issue on my side. In any case, any product that completely corrupts its data with no chance for fixing it is not something I can trust for my personal finances any more.    I am severely disappointed with Quicken and their support at this time. Until the quality of this product is greatly increased, I don't see how it can be trusted knowing that it could potentially corrupt this data again and not be recovered."
0,"We have always used this program and it worked great.  This year, we filed as usual.  Then found out from our daughter's college where we are applying for financial aid that something was completely different from last year.  Doubled checked.  The return had been done completely wrong!  It missed several key components to our specific situation that it has always caught before.  It was so complicated to ammend we had to go into an H&R office to have it redone for $100.00.<br /><br />Now our daughter's financial aid is all on hold till the new one is processed. And when I called to ask for re-imbursement for the 100 we had to spend to fix this, that was denied.<br /><br />It will be a pain because our info is all on file with H&R but we will have to start all over next year with a new company for our taxes.<br /><br />Will tell everyone I know about this mess..."
0,"It's shameful Intuit would release a product that should be a beta than a production release. I am a long term Quicken user from back in the DOS days and a former beta tester! Upgrading from Home and Business 2010 was a nightmare! After purchasing the download I installed it, and the program returned an error it couldn't apply updates it had downloaded. Next up was to acquire the patch and manually install. Needless to say it broke the windows installer and and completely destroyed the Norton Ghost installation. This issue couldn't be resolved so I have requested a refund.<br /><br />The program is buggy, the budgeting interface is aweful, no customization of a color interface, and very busy and confusing. Quicken never was strong on the budgeting component, but this is the WORST I have ever seen.<br /><br />The add reports to the toolbar customization, doesn't work! Saved programs from previous versions do not work. The savings Goals graphs are not formated correctly and the dollar amount is cut off on the right of the screen. Additionaly, unless you specify a target goal amount, the current amount residing in savings goals won't even display. The budget reports are inaccurate and more time than there worth. The default Personal Income and Personal Expense groups cannot be removed which is the source of the inaccuracy. Geesh, did anyone at Intuit have an accounting primer or have a clue how this is to work. Many of the same errors have been present in the last 3 Windows releases.<br /><br />Enter the Ipad, Android mobile app. All fine and dandy but I for one could care less about putting my financial data in the cloud, on someone elses server. A mobile app is fine, if it could sync directly to the desktop. Call me old fashioned. In testing the Cloud I have found it is a hybrid version of mint and desktop quicken and quite frankly doesn't work. The mobile version will aggregate real time account data which tells me you have surrended your passwords and given accessto your accounts. It also produces and alters the register balance, deletes your historical transactions on sync which is the source of the error, making it incorrect and not accurate at all! Basically they have tried to merge Mint and Desktop together  and its failed. For those that value your finances and keep accurate records, this is not the product!<br /><br />I could rant on, but I wont. The bozos who are part of the product development team need to get their act together. What I am intersted in is a solid desktop financial product based on trusted accounting principles. What I am not interested in is a product geared for the GenX GenY generation. I have a feeling the end of comprehensive desktop software is near it's end.<br /><br />Unfortunately I do not recommend purchasing this product at this time. Its nothing more than a public beta release. The cloud sync is a security disaster waiting to happen. Buyer Beware! INTUIT NEEDS TO RELEASE A PRODUCT PATCH WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK!<br /><br />UPDATE: R3 RELEASE<br /><br />Little has changed in this release. Mobile Sync is still non usable.<br />Saved Reports shortcuts have not been fixed.<br />Verify file in File Operations hangs and does not complete.<br />Whole interface is more clunky and unstable, crashes routinely on Windows Pro 64bit. R2 did not have this problem.<br />Custom Expense Graph is not accurate. The sumary box displays an inaccurate total, until the view whole graph is clicked, which produces the correct result.<br /><br />OVERHAUL ANNOYANCE is the inability to customize the categories used in the stock views. EG. My Money View, is of little value as a complete summation of useless data that one may or may not want to track. The lack of the ability to customize these views is an otherwise waste of screen space. I think most will agree, Personal accounting is just that, and what the developers feel what should be reported and viewed isn't necessarily the right one.<br /><br />The strong points of the program are the powerful historical data collection and reporting capabilities, the direct downloads from hundreds of financial institutions, and free flowing data entry interface. If you can live without investment data and require to the penny accuracy you should consider Quick Books. Honestly Quicken is Intuits CASH COW, but I think this cow is out of milk. Unfortunately  I am actively searching and trialing several competing products as an alternate replacment, and yes I have used it for more than 20 years. This product by all practical purposes is at the end of its life in its current state couopled with a mandatory update every three years with Intuits sunset policy, and a recurrent history of NEVER fixing whats broken and releasing the same junk year after year. It's not a matter of \\""if\\"" but \\""when\\"" will Intuit drive that final nail!<br /><br />UPDATE RELEASE 4<br /><br />Released solved nothing. Product is mess, junk, broke. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE R6<br /><br />Release resolved nothing. Core bugs remain, R6 completely screwed up the data file. THIS IS THE WORST RELEASE OF QUICKEN SOFTWARE SINCE ITS INCEPTION!!!!! I HAVE DOWNGRADED MY RATING TO 1, AND I MAINTAIN A DO NOT BUY FOR THIS JUNK! IT IS UNRELIABLE, YOU CAN NOT TRUST THE DATA, AND SO MUCH OF THE REPORTING IS BROKE AND INACURATE, I AM SORRY I EVER USED IT. This product is simply unacceptable so to the customer service reps that keep responding, STOP THE BULLSHIT. The product is broke!"
4,"I LOVE this download, obviously H and R does this for a living so their product is intuitive and smart, we have somewhat medium taxes, so we do have extra forms to fill out and this software does it all.  It is great to have a bonus of the state download.  Of course downloading it means you can instantly do your taxes, no excuses."
1,"This is a good antivirus, but anythime it finds a threat in an usb memory stick it resets my pc, I have lost a lot of work for this issue."
2,"It's not THAT good, so I wouldn't suggest paying $10 for it, but I haven't used it that much to be fair. I used a coupon to get it for $0."
3,"very user friendly, would use it again.  quick and easy returns."
3,"Been using H&R Block software for years and this year's version was not as clear for me as prior years.  Brought my laptop into H&R Block office and even the tax specialist had some difficulty resolving my questions.  However, I will buy again next year."
3,"Despite problems I experienced last year, I stayed with H&R Block this year because of the terrible reviews the new TurboTax got. I was pleasantly surprised to experience no difficulty with Block's software this year, and I have a fairly complicated return. My only beef is the $20 extra charge for state e-filing. It's just a profit grab."
2,"This software for preparing United States Income and State taxes works well.  IMHO all of these tax preparation programs are overpriced but the alternative of doing 20 pages of tax forms by hand can be so daunting that \\""ya just bite the bullet and get it\\"".  And since H & R is considerably less expensive than its Turbo Tax Counterpart and since both do the same job - H & R has been our choice for the last 3 years."
0,I don't like it as much
2,"Worded adequately, nothing special about it, and since I needed to file two states, while the first state was free, the second state cost $40, this is far too excessive in my opinion, it was more than the cost of the base software that included one state."
2,"This product is useful, but not useful enough to warrant the price. It'd be a better deal as a $5-$10 Mac App Store download, that's a price range that more accurately reflects the available functionality.    Also, the Amazon software download process was an utter nightmare. There were problems with the registration (it was registered under a random username, without my email, so MacPaw didn't have me on file at all) and installing the product. I'd recommend going directly to the developer's site to purchase: [...]"
2,"I have been using TurboTax every year since at least 2000.  For the most part I have found it very helpful.  However, there are times I don't understand the way something is worded on the TT screen, but selecting Help takes me to IRS instructions which don't explain the TT wording or for which the connection to the TT screen is not clear.  I believe the Help materials have decreased in quality over the years.<br /><br />I also have an uncommon situation:  I live in a foreign country which requires me to pay income tax.  For that reason, I choose not to take the Foreign Earned Income (FEI) exclusion, because I would rather the US gov't get my money than the gov't where I live.  But this year TT would not let me not take the FEI exclusion.  No matter how many times I chose not to take it, the program would always automatically change my answer!  Tech support could not find a way around this.  The bottom line is that I struggled with this right up to the filing deadline & ended up needing to file by mail, because the program would not let me e-file the way it was.  I missed the deadline due to this bug.<br /><br />Which brings me to my final gripe:  Tech Support.  The last guy spent 4 hours with me on a chat trying to figure this out, which is really above & beyond.  But the prior contacts with Tech Support were more like efforts to convince me that I was doing something stupid and there was really no problem.  You have to badger these people incessantly to admit that there is actually a bug in their program.  Even then, they're not about to fix it!  (After finally admitting to a bug, Tech Support then sent me another e-mail detailing a work-around which had already been tried several times to no avail.)"
1,IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS PRODUCE FOR IT'S ONLINE STORE YOU CAN NOT COLLECT SALES TAX.....<br />YOU CAN ONLY COLLECT VAT TAX WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE IN USA.<br />IF NO SALES TAX NO ONLINE STORE.<br /><br />END OF STORY
1,"I really want to like Quicken every year.  I updated from 2013 to 2015.  The mobile experience had stopped working in 2013 despite hours of back and forth with Intuit and repeated &#34;delete, uninstall, re-install, re-create, etc&#34; processes.  2015 fixed the mobile experience.  The desktop experience got worse.  The application is MUCH slower.  It takes several (up to 10) seconds to switch between accounts or screens.  There is a constant paint, re-paint, refresh process going on that no other application on my computer does nor did Quicken 2013.  My budget got messed up during the transition (no big deal as its a good idea to refresh that thing every once in a while anyway) and all of my accounts had a slight (a few dollars / cents) balance adjustment needed after the upgrade (this is stupid for a financial accounting piece of software but manageable.)  I'm hoping an update fixes the speed issue.  This is the thing that will make me return this in 55 more days."
3,"very good, have used for years. sometimes intuitive, sometimes baffling, the help and faqs are ok, the fee for e-filing the state return is exorbitant"
1,"Quicken 2014 allows me to download my bank and credit card information, but the budgeting tools have a significant slew of problems.  Constantly changes budget amounts without rhyme or reason.  Even after all the recommended updates and fixes, the stability of the software is so inconsistent that it is difficult to use for even 30 minutes without it crashing or the visualization becoming &#34;garbled&#34;.  Anything that tries to &#34;automatically&#34; categorize does such a poor job of recognizing simple things such as fast food or gas stations has led me to disabling all but the most rudimentary features of the application.  I have a hard time reconciling that the makers of this software are the same people that own mint.com.  I'll be switching to that for a while during the time I am searching to find another tool that can do the job better.  For background, I am an IT professional that assists development teams in creating usable software and tools.  So trust me when I say that this program would not get out the door at my company with the problems it has."
3,Novices need better language to understand how to make good decisions about buying products and informing where to go for furthering information
3,"Guess this could be 5 stars.  Downloaded wireless in 8 minutes.  Installed on new 27&#34; iMac running Mavs but upon opening office apps, would not work.  Had to install updates also that are free from microsoft website, there were 3 updates that HAD to be installed.  Once done, all apps work ok.  Had to do some research to figure this out though.  I can only presume this is reason why apps would not open, like Excel and Word."
3,"It's difficult to to go back and correct errors, etc.<br />They can still do a better job on K1s"
1,This is only good for putting things in date order except deposits and checks are &#34;rearranged&#34; automatically and I do not like that at all.<br />There is also no customer service and data cannot be transferred from this program to the same program that is flash drive specific.<br />I have 15 years of checkbooks with multiple account that I want to get digitized and this is not making things any easier.
2,"I obviously bought this to learn QuickBooks, with which I had NO experience. The video is comprehensive and, if you can pay attention from beginning to end, you can probably turn around a teach someone else how to set up and run QuickBooks.<br /><br />I just wanted a basic understanding to get me started. I found after trial and error that using my laptop to &#34;play&#34; the video while I worked on my desktop was the best way for me to get any value out of the video rather than clicking back and forth between windows.<br /><br />Overall, I found the video a little boring and tedious, and I lost interest. My accountant showed me the basics of QuickBooks in ten minutes on my laptop in her office. For me, it turns out that sitting down with my accountant was a far better learning strategy for me. I doubt if I will refer to this product in the future..."

3,"I have a large (135 GB) music library spread over a few locations and I don't let itunes manage it, so when it came time for a new computer, I faced the prospect of losing metadata that had taken years to assemble. Supersync did the job, with the exception of the last played date, which I don't think is salvageable. Setting up the server took a bit of effort and the transfer was pretty slow -- it took a couple of all nighters. My upload connection??  (Only one of the computers could be wired, the other had to be wifi.) However the program is robust -- it remembers where it was in the transfer and I think the cleanup features will continue to be helpful on the new installation."

4,I've been using Avast! Antivirus for about 2 years now after my son recommended it to me.  I really like the fact that it auto-updates and it has stopped many viruses and other problems that have arisen.  I've recommended it to several of my friends and they have liked it very much also.

For our retail business, it last cost $1000.00 per register or computer that utilizes or accesses the POS software, (that includes a computer that is used not as a register, but as an office computer and is used for entering PO's, receiving items and inventory maintenance)  For our manufacturing company we will have to pay just short of $1000.00 for a 3 user system we just purchased in 2010.  We only currently need two and I am quite satisfied with the current version and don't want or need Intuit's upgrade.  If we are to not purchase the forced upgrade,we will no longer be able to use the already, in addition too, paid for payroll portion of our paid for software. This is an annual fee.  When I first purchased Quick books I had the option to manually add payroll tax table, Intuit eventually stop offering this so we then had to buy their tables and update on a yearly basis at currently near $500.00 per year.  It makes you wonder what they will add on as an additional fee in the future that is currently not charge for.<br /><br />Buyer Beware.  Be ready to spend, spend, spend to continue to use software you already paid full price for initially."
3,"I purchased this software as a reward to myself for writing 50,000 words in the National Novel Writing Month competition this past November. I thought that perhaps it might help me to flesh out stories I've been thinking about for a while.<br /><br />It's important to know what Contour is, and isn't. If you're looking for a product in which you can actually type up and write your novel or screenplay, this isn't what you're looking for. If you're looking for a product that will give you reams of information about character development, setting, or dialogue, this isn't it. But if you're looking for a tool to help you plot out a story in detail from beginning to end, Contour will help.<br /><br />Contour appears to be based on the Christopher Vogler and Joseph Campbell &#34;Hero's Journey&#34; plot structure. This is where you follow the hero of the story as they pass through orphan, wandered, warrior, and martyr stages of their story. If you're not a fan of the Vogler/Campbell work, you'll want to avoid this software. If you're an &#34;organic&#34; writer who doesn't do well with an outline or a structure, you'll also want to avoid it. As for me, I've learned that I do my best work when I get it all plotted out and developed in advance. I still write organically, but it's in line with a plan.<br /><br />Contour starts by asking you the &#34;big questions&#34; about your story. Who's your main character? What are they trying to accomplish? Who is trying to stop them? What happens if they fail?<br /><br />Then it goes on to ask you to write a brief statement about the story, in the format of &#34;When a person wants A, he tries B, only to discover that C happens, and he must respond by doing D.&#34; The A, B, C, and D are related to the orphan, wanderer, warrior, and martyr stages in the Campbell myth structure.<br /><br />Next, Contour walks you through developing plot points for each stage in the story. For each point or group of points, the software provides information about the kinds of things that typically happen at this point in the story.<br /><br />To help you get a handle on the practical use of the tool, Contour includes a bunch of pre-filled-in story information for familiar and popular movies like American Beauty, Star Wars, Kung Fu Panda, Silence of the Lambs, and Wall-E. You can easily flip between the story you're working on and one of these examples, which can help you better understand the theory and answer the question &#34;What do they want here?&#34;<br /><br />In the end, Contour provides a &#34;report&#34; that either gives you a beat sheet or structure document with your story laid out in an easy-to-write from outline. For reasons I don't understand, they don't export this structure to Microsoft Word, RTF, or even PDF format. It's saved in a &#34;Quick Report Format&#34; that isn't any of these. You can print this QRF document to paper, or use the Windows XPS virtual printer to share it with others.<br /><br />If you're looking for help structuring and plotting out your stories, Contour is a good and relatively inexpensive writing tool for doing that... provided you're good with the Vogler/Campbell structure.<br /><br />As for me, I still haven't mastered a number of writing techniques - structure being one of them. Tools like this that help me flesh out the structure of my stories are a good thing.ion about the kinds of things that typically happen at this point in the story.<br /><br />To help you get a handle on the practical use of the tool, Contour includes a bunch of pre-filled-in story information for familiar and popular movies like American Beauty, Star Wars, Kung Fu Panda, Silence of the Lambs, and Wall-E.

0,"Crap!  Spam,  malware,  adware junk"
1,kind of stupid and useless
4,Always had great results with H&R's software.
4,"Saves you soooo much time. Downloading this item to keep you computer safe, gives me &#34;peace of mine&#34; knowing I am secure."
1,"several things broken:<br />1. window position not retained from one session to the next<br />2. when updating transactions with a linked cash account the boughtx transaction isn't used, only bought, so the cash amount is wrong."
2,Still  don't understand a accounting software that will not print deposit slips
4,Great as always
0,"I do like the way H+R Block software works, but be very warned:<br />This is a rip off! The Deluxe version here does not warn you that you have to pay another 39.99 to get a State Software. H+R Blocks website says Deluxe gives you one free State download, but this version does not...<br /><br />You are much better off to buy the Deluxe w/ one state for 34.99, but this is not intuitive. And it's a rip off unless you live<br />in a state w/o Income Tax. That is this version's only advantage, and neither Amazon nor H+R Block tell you this openly and clearly.<br />You will be sorry!"
4,Like buying a Mac. You know what you are buying. One complaint I can't figure out how many activations this has
0,Received run time error message when installing download product.  Something with an architecture and Windows versus Intuit language problem. Last year I had to get a refund after 4 hours of Windows and Intuit support not fixing the issue.<br />System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException:Type 'System.Data.SqlServerCe.SqlCeErrorCollection' in assembly......Intuit.Spc.Esd.Win.Client.Application.Updater.Program.Execute  BOMBS!<br /><br />How do I get a CD instead of download?
4,Very usrefull and affordable. Very fa fast to download using the internet.  I love to travel and when I buya ticket or a hotel room I made a copy for my security if I lost the original.<br />Oreste
1,I do not how to use this software to do my tax with stock transaction.
1,Not too crazy about this program. I was underwhelmed. Didn't do what I wanted and I never use it.
2,"Very disappointed in this product.  It is the first time I have downloaded, instead of using a disk.  I was disappointed that I'd have to pay an additional $29.99 for a state return."
4,I generally hold out moving to the newest version of any new software.  Always left waiting for the update to correct flaws in the original version.  I can say that has not been the case with Quicken.  I have been very satisfied with the latest version Quicken 2015.  Great job!
1,"I have used Norton products for years on numerous computers.  The program can be glitchy, then its hard to fixxy, last time I updated, works fine on the desktop, glitchy on the laptop, many.......hours into trying to find the remedy,  if you enjoy being aggrevated buy it"
2,I am mostly satisfied with this software but wish it could do more than it states it can do on my pc.
4,"I have used Turbo Tax for over 20 years. The process and in-depth tax issues discussed continues to get better each year. It is worth the price ten-fold. Doing the taxes myself let's me take my time and review everything I need to, again and again, until I know it's right. Great piece of mind when filing!"
1,"Spend you money on a Solid State Drive (SSD) instead, your PC / laptop will run a lot faster. My Window Vista boot-up about 10 times faster with a SDD installed."
2,Decent
0,This software sucks. Period.
3,"Does a good job on taxes, you just have to be organized going in. Knowing all your accounts and where all your paperwork is. I have been using turbo-tax for years, and I compared it a few times to what an accountant did, and they gave me the same results."
2,Way too complicated for a beginner or intermediate user. The user help doesn't really give step by step instructions. I'm sure if you know what your doing this is a great product but otherwise you'll find yourself lost and confused.
1,This version of quicken is not very user friendly and I would not recommend it. The budget portion of the program is especially poorly designed. The budget portion of the program does not seem to talk to the debt pay down portion of the program. I also keep having to delete random amounts from my budget. There is nothing in the program that alerts you as to whether you have a balanced budget or not. Also having difficulty doing direct downloads from investment accounts. This was not an issue in the last version of quicken that I had. I only give it 2 stars because I can not find another program to use. Otherwise I would give it 1 star.
2,"I have been a Quicken user (PC version) for over 10 years.  I have recently become a MAC user, being tired of all the instabilities of the Windows OS. There are subtle differences in the layouts between the PC and MAC versions of Quicken (although I do not own the 2015 version for the PC (and WON'T). I will be working out all the differences eventually, but for the most part, Quicken 2015 for MAC seems to be just the right app for all my financial needs."
4,"I love Quicken. It's easy keeping track of bills, when they're due and how much I owe. I can see how much money I have to spend right away. It's easy inputting all my information."
0,"This version of quicken is so far out of intuits usual quality it is not to be believed.  I have been a quicken user for more years than I care to count but this upgrade is crap.<br /><br />The product crashes, It hangs, it maxes out CPU and never comes back, It no longer is able to download transactions from institutions where I have been downloading transactions for years with earlier versions.<br /><br />Avoid this version of quicken, save your self many hours of frustration."
0,"Connectify, the free version, sounds good, but it limits what one can do by shutting itself off after no great period of time.  It is invasive in that it constantly is trying to get one to update with pop-ups.  When uninstalled, it turns off the hosted-network capability of the computer, which is confusing for most mortals.  If you want an easy WiFi connection to your computer, try the free Virtual Router Plus.  It requires no installation, does not invade your screen with upgrade requests, and works for as long as you leave it on.  In short, Connectify is not worth it."
0,Have used TurboTax for many years without incident but this years version (2014) had so many glitches it was unreal. The program was a nightmare when I went to amend an already filed federal return. I had to recheck every line several times to be certain of the correctness. Also when I did the state return the TurboTax program automatically did an amended state return even though it was the initial time I had attempted to do it. I will have to think long and hard about putting my faith in next years product as I was completely disgusted with this one.
4,"This product is highly rated for its effectiveness, however it is a little scary the company is based out of Moscow.  I use it on all my desktops, laptops, and mobile devices."
1,"Deceiving ad strategy.<br />This is how I purchased Turbo Tax: TurboTax Premier Mac Fed + Efile + State 2013 with Refund Bonus Offer [Download] = $74.89<br /><br />What did I end up paying? NJ e-file fee for $19.99 and a refund processing fee that was $29.99 and all of a sudden changed to $34.99.<br /><br />Come on, give me a break! Why did you change the refund processing fee from $29.99 to $34.99? and why don't you mention that there is a refund processing fee? at the end, I put $500 of my refund towards an Amazon card, but the 10% bonus they give me will end up being eaten up by this refund processing fee.<br /><br />I understand that the Amazon ad shows that there is a state e-file fee. But there was nothing about a refund processing fee.<br /><br />So, in total, I paid $129.87 to get my taxes done with TBT. I had used it before, but I had never paid this much."
1,"The program did not work as well as I hoped. The program had too many problems in layout the floor design that matched the 3D rendering. When using stairs, the rendering was opposite on what I used, (up when down), so I had flip the stairs to properly render; the wall texture would not cover entire wall, and when viewing in 3D mode to walk around, the display kept getting confused on my location and resulting in me not seeing what was correct. I had to completely exit the program and re-select the 3D mode and set the camera to the proper location before I could get the correct rendering. At the point, the program is only fine in non-3D mode.<br /><br />So for me, this was not a good purchase and I cannot recommend using the program."
0,"I tried to roll with this, but it takes away certain feature that were standard in the 2007,2010 versions.  Yes, it was mainly for legal reasons, but this is a reduced version.  On top of that - it is in the 'cloud' only!  That means that you need to download it and you will never have a hard copy.  This price should be $50 because of these companies making us use OUR resources to save them money but they are not saving us money!<br /><br />I found a 2007 Professional (actually the highest level version) online for $99!  It was at Undergroundraw!  You know the rest.  That is a better deal.  It is older, but it has everything on it and it cheaper.  You also have a hard copy in your hands."
4,Works as advertised
4,"Even the free Avast! account for viruses, spyware & malware is excellent! I was lucky to buy this, believe me. I had an Alienware from before the Dell takeover and a piece of malware totally destroyed it. When I got my new computer I installed Avast! immediately. There were indeed a several instances where it would stop me before loading a page that turned out to have malware of some kind & I was damned glad. You can hardly do better than Avast! unless you can create your own security program by hand. In which case you can probably not have to worry"
4,like a condom for your computer! Haven't gotten any virus with this package (unlike so many of their competitor products). The price was fair considering it as a 3 license product and the download was a snap to figure out and use with success the first time...
0,"We were never able to install either the Photoshop or the Premiere software. God knows we tried. After failing on our own, we spent one hour on the phone with Amazon (who were very nice), and about 4 or 5 hours on the phone with several folks from ADOBE. It just didn't happen. The programs would download, but refuse to install. The same error message appeared at every attempt: either we didn't have enough space on our computer (a brand new desktop with Windows 7 and a terabyte of memory), or we didn't have the Admin authority (we are all administrators).<br />The tech support variously set up new admin desktops, took control of the computer, purged the machine of potential bad files, re-downloaded each program (ultimately several times), and all with no success. One of the last techs suggested that it must be a problem with our computer (Supposedly we were being moved higher in ADOBE's tech support hierarchy each time we called, but it didn't always seem like it). Ultimately, after several days/phone calls, we gave up, got a refund from Amazon, and purchased Cyberlink's Power Director 11 (To replace Premiere. Still haven't decided on a Photoshop replacement). Power Director 11 loaded and installed with no problems. As a postscript, we googled this ADOBE install issue, and discovered unsurprisingly that others have had the same problem.<br />A couple of notes about ADOBE's tech support. When we initially called they wanted to charge $39 just to talk on the phone. They waived the $39 after a 5 minute verbal tizzy on our part. Their tech support is in a noisy room in New Delhi, so they often complained that they couldn't understand/hear us, and vice versa. Some of them were polite, helpful and smart, others seemed somewhat indifferent.<br />In the end, all the time and effort put in on both ends proved fruitless."
3,Turbo Tax was easy to walk through and resulted in my receiving a refund for the first time in years.  No problems encountered along the way.  I highly recommend to friends and family.
4,I loved the price and convenience of being able to get it right away!  I would recommend it to everyone!
2,"Still pretty buggy software, not worth upgrading from version 2013. OK if you are a first time Quicken buyer. One nice feature is that they added a &#34;reset account&#34; button for all those times that Quicken gets lost with downloading your financial institution data to your computer."
4,"I'm very happy with the free Avast antivirus software.  They also have a paid upgraded plan, but I just have the free plan and am very happy with it."
3,"Found a good deal on Amazon.  Had a bit of trouble with the download on my laptop, and had to consult their customer service.  My situation needed a work around, but the service was really good."
3,"The last time I updated to Quicken 2012, it was a tough go.  Kind of like upgrading from Windows XP to Windows Vista: things were changed and move around for no discernible reason, and it just looked like change for change's sake, leading to a frustrating user experience.<br /><br />Not this time around.  Quicken 2015 has the look and feel very similar to Quicken 2012, and thus I was able to jump right in and easily use it without issue.  There are some very minor tweaks that I've discovered so far, and they appear to make things easier or otherwise add something to the experience, rather than being a change just to justify paying for an upgrade.<br /><br />Looks good, and is giving good value so far."
0,"Quicken 2015 Home and Business still has the same problem as Quicken Home and Business 2014 with syncing the bank info to my personal and business checking accounts. It only works correctly for a short time maybe a week or two, then connection errors occur to both checking accounts. I try again and again to rest the accounts. Then they may work ok for a short time and the same thing happens again in a week or so. I update them manually because Quicken is unable to do it reliably. The older versions of Quicken never had this problem. I have been using quicken for many years. I have been with my current bank over 20 years and the account settings have not changed in years. Quicken is getting worse with each upgrade."
1,"I was given the link for 2014 and could never download it for one reason or another. I finally got the right link, but more often than I care for, it will not work. May be it is the same bunch of bugs affecting OS 8.1. I do not use it much. I found another office suite that works all of the time. It seems like Microsoft is not really happy doing their stuff because others are coming out with things that actually work, have rare problems and I pay so much less."
0,"I've never written a review before, but the experience so far has motivated me enough to do so. The license management system for MS Office 2013 is abysmal, even if they have made it transferable to different PCs. If you own multiple single license keys, there is no way in hell to track which licenses are activated and where(the serial number which you got with your card key just disappears after you associate it with your microsoft account), and we end up getting activation errors because all the Office INSTALL buttons (inside your microsoft account)look identical but have different keys associated with them. What's even better is there's no way to change a product key once you install the office except to call the support and you risk deactivating another computer which had the same key. It's just the most amazing user experience yet."
3,This is a good suite of office productivity for the price.  Its a great valuable alternative and easy to navigate.
3,no problems and the price was right. i would much rather have this over that creative cloud crap that they have now.
1,"I really would like to like Quicken.  We use in my workplace a program called QuickBooks, and it is extremely useful.  I want something that works as well as that.  The interface in Quicken is good, fairly intuitive.  But its online connection functionality with my bank is horrible.  I have had Quicken two and one half months, and in that time, I have had to spend two hours in online technical support chat to install patches and reinstall things.  Now the support was helpful, but every week, the same problems crop up--Quicken can't find my accounts online with my bank, and I have to go through a lengthy process of 'reminding' Quicken which bank account is tied to which file inside Quicken.<br /><br />Now I don't know if this is a problem with my bank, or with Quicken itself.  I suppose I could try to find out.  But I dread the no doubt long and complicated process that I would have to go through to make that happen, when this should be done by my (large, well-known) bank, and the makers of Quicken.<br /><br />I'm going to continue to use Quicken because it helps me with budgeting, but I'm not impressed by its clunkiness, and if I find a better answer, I'm going to drop it."
1,"I used the microsoft Money product for years, and found it easy and intuitive, but MS discontinued it, so I was forced to go to Quicken. I find quicken difficult to use, even on something as simple as entering a transaction. It is a pain to have to hit save every time (MS was automatic), the reports are a pain to create because you have to slough through every category in a tiny box that can't be enlarged.  Add one new category, and you have to do it again.  I have lots of wrong categories because quicken didn't remember the previous use so asked for a new category, and I didn't remember so I entered something a little different, so that means lots of editing later on.  I have to go back and double check everything that is auto-downloaded, because it does not always remember the correct category from previous similar entries downloaded from the bank or credit card.  I've had HUGE issues with the investment section. With just one simple SEP account that I have.  I withdrew some money from the account, and the cash amount/value has NEVER been correct since (almost two years), even with spending an hour on the phone with tech support.  Come on guys, the transactions are downloaded every time (I download weekly), why can't it figure out the correct balance???  Overall, I miss the microsoft Money product a LOT.  I also do NOT like being forced to pay up for an upgrade after a few years, especially when I can see no obvious differences in the different versions. It's still as clunky as the previous two versions that I had to pay for."
2,"It is an adequate office suite.  It does not compare to Microsoft office 2010, or Lotus Office Suite.  However, it is adequate for most work, etc. typing a letter.  Simple to learn how to operate"
0,"Version 12 crashes at any given moment while editing videos or slideshows.  At this point, I've lost hours worth of work.  Absolutely unreliable."
1,"In the past, Turbo Tax allowed a person to do investment taxes with Delux.  I used Turbo Tax Premere last year and it didn't help with investment tax information any better than Delux.  This year I bought Turbo Tax Delux and it would not allow mw to enter 1099 B information at all.  I had to upgrade to Premere for $32. I have been using Turbo Tax for 13 years now.  It is time to find another tax preperation program!"
0,"No... I needed the Non-Profit version, which I bought online but it then needs to be &#34;upgraded&#34; to get some basic application. QB's did the bait and switch routine. Why do you charge soooo much for soooo little. After all, we are a non-profit charity... not a multi-corporation business. The money we would have to give QB can be put to a much better purpose...

0,It showed I owed IRS $2905 tax on $5864 taxable income; approx. 50% tax! IRS tax table says I owe only $588 tax!
1,"Save your money. Get 2013 version at half price and get same features. 2014 has many bugs that Intuit is ignoring. e.g. fonts are too big on registers and too small on account side bar with no available option to change them (except to make register font bigger), on investment register, total value does not appear, column widths are almost impossible to change. Biggest problem is Intuit's lack of concern. They have too many users to worry over &#34;little&#34; problems. I have been Quicken user for many years and am very disappointed."
4,"Just as I suspected, there were no problems with this virus protection package. I have 365 days of protection which means my newest computer will have the same level as all of my previous ones. Great job Amazon for selling the best products at a fair price"
3,"Later found out Deluxe won't handle stock investment, has to upgrade to Premier.."
2,I feel like there are a lot of fees involved.
3,Bought this product to protect my computer.  It was nice to just download and it was pretty easy.  Price was great also.
3,"I've bought Norton 360 for at Office Max every year, all the way to Norton 360 4.0, until Eastman-Kodak declared bankruptcy.  I can't find Norton 360 anymore, so this is what you get these days.  I bought it because of a browser-override program that was making all 4 web browsers default to  a malicious search engine which sold my searches to private companies. It didn't catch it, although it caught a lot of other problems."
2,"Bought this when the version bundled with my LG blueray/dvd R/W stopped receiving updates and could not play newer (late 2014, early 2015) Blue ray releases.<br /><br />It still have the now 'usual' PwerDVD annoyances; mainly the need to open a popup window to navigate the Blueray on screen menu. Sure would be better if we could simply over the mouse around and click (it's been long enough since the first blue ray support isn't it?).<br /><br />As always, video quality is good-great<br /><br />3 stars for &#34;does the job well, could be better&#34;"
2,"THere are other programs cheaper and talking to friends, just as good. TurboTax doesn't jump out from the rest anymore. If I wasn't doing my childrens taxes and filing them (with the free Fed File) I'd be using the other programs."
1,DO NOT Purchase from Amazon.com. Purchase only Directly from I Bank who will give you 90 Days to try the produce at which time you can return it and receive a refund. This will not happen with Amazon...once purchased it is yours to keep. I Bank is problematic and a bit difficult to get used to. Had lots of trouble downloading transactions and updating accounts. Not worth $50 bucks.
3,"The price is better than the disk. The program is fine to do taxes. Here are six more words, done."
1,I thought I was buying something that would keep my checking account on my computer.
3,I am pretty satisfied with this offering.  I am a sole owner of an LLC (no employees) and entering in my data was quick and painless.  I enjoyed the automatic pulling of my tax forms from my employer and bank statements (for interest).  My only complaint is I also heavily traded in stocks with a pretty well known broker named TradeKing.  This broker is not part of their partner list which means (unfortunately) you have to type in your own profit/loss entry for every trade.  Many of my stocks had given me dividends which need their own line items.  It can be tedious (although it was easy) and required some time.  Other than that the product worked as advertised.  I've used TurboTax for the past 4 years and will continue to do so in the future.
2,"The program itself was the usual Turbo Tax with a great price but what I was disappointed in was the fact that even tho we have used Turbo Tax for the past 7 or 8 years, because we downloaded this version, prior years were not available nor automatically downloaded as they are when we purchase the disc.  And don't bother trying to telephone anyone - that doesn't happen!!"
1,Might be my last year to use TurboTax.  First year a return has resulted in audit from state; plus all the other bad write-up TurboTax has had this year.
2,As described. A little more difficult to use then expected. Downloaded easily.
2,"I worked for Intuit for 6 years, including managing teams in both product development and marketing. TurboTax is a solid product and they're the industry leader for a reason.  But everyone should know that they have a large team dedicated to testing pricing and up-sells (hidden charges). This change was made to optimize revenue, plain and simple. That's their prerogative, they're a business after all. Bob Meighan is a great guy but it's job to sell the public on these types of business decisions.<br /><br />There are plenty of other options, some better in my opinion. Checkout Common Form or TaxAct. Both have more fair and transparent pricing. (Disclosure: I'm the CEO of Common Form)."
1,"I wish that companies can test several scenarios before they put their software out for the consumer.  In order to download this software, I needed to shut off my firewall, then load Firefox.  This download didn't work with IE.  The software from INTUIT is great, but the download process can be time consuming.  Silly me, I expected to click on the DOWNLOAD BUTTON and I expected it to download...."
4,"So much easier to use than Turbotax and a lot less expensive. Got a great deal and did my taxes, which are somewhat complicated, in only a few hours one Saturday. Will continue to use this product."
2,They somehow made it more complex this year and it was a bit more klunky....but got the job done.
0,"This virus protector made my computer run slow, i couldn't even get online after i installed. I also couldnt use my printer. I had to take computer back to original in order to make it better. It didnt mess up until i installed this."
0,"I suppose it is doing it's job, but the computer runs so slowly now I can't stand it.  I have never had to wait for an Amazon page to load and now...well, I could go start a load of clothes washing and still have to wait when I get back!  I guess the &#34;360&#34; means every time you click, it has to travel all the way around the world before allowing the page to load!  Frustrating!"
1,It allowed adware to be installed on my computer and I still haven't gotten it off.  That should not happen.
1,Have used Norton 360 for several years with the disk format so decided to try the downloadable version this year.  A combination of operator error and likely system clashes resulted in a near disaster so it's gone.  Kudos to Amazon for accepting my explanation and going against their policy of not refunding  downloads and giving me a $10 credit to boot!
4,"I'm not going to review Adobe Acrobat. It is what it is. But, if you need it, downloading it from Amazon is fast, painless, and well priced."
1,"If you had previously registered your  device, be sure you can retrieve the log in information when it was first registered For istance, it you have a used device, you may not have the registration information.    I bought my Garmin device a while ago from Circuit City and updated the maps. After  several new computers I find I lack the original login information. I set up a new account, but I was informed this serial number was already registered.    When I tried to install the map I purchased, it refused to accept it saying \\""the unit is registered to someone else\\"". They are factually wrong (of course, they have no way of knowing whether I am the person who first registered this device). The implied accusation that I have a stolen unit is somewhat irritating.     More seriously, I cannot install the map.    They seem to have no obvious solution even though this problem must come up routinely. While this could serve as an anti-theft protection, it deprives them of  revenue and leaves a bad taste.     An obvious recovery procedure (which would also avoid insulting their customers) would be to permit installation where the account owner had the same name, address, and phone number as the original registrant (true in my case).    Update:      Outcome is their records show my legally purchased machine is registered to someone else (apparently in NC where I have never lived).     Thus they are not permitting me to install the map I purchased.    It is not clear what happened, but the best guess is that someone  made a mistake in entering the serial number of their machine. Since such an error could have happened on your machine, I would exercise caution in purchasing a new updated map this way."
1,"You will too! it takes hours to figure out the simplest tasks only to conclude these things no longer exist, imposible to import contacts, omits their email addresses!  windows 8 is bad enough!!"
4,I was very surprised with the sound Quality. Also they are very comfortable to wear.
0,by the time you buy the softwarein paid all the hidden feesyou're almost better off going to an accountant
3,Works good
0,"I can't believe this lousy company does not offer email support.  I have an install problem, and the only way to get help is to sit on  the phone for 20-30 minutes.  This is terrible customer service."
3,"Price through amazon better than through Intuit, only Costco had a slightly better deal, if you wanted to add a support plan.<br />2013 has some changes I don't like but as Intuit forces you to &#34;upgrade&#34; ever 3 years or lose your payroll function, I had no choice."
1,"I can't get it to work.  Went on the computers, but can't figure out how to get them to work.  Probably user fault."
4,Fast delivery and  great quality
2,for the past few years I have used H&R block.  I can't say this is any better or worse.  I think i will be going back to H&R block because I like it a little better
1,"When I finally had enough of unsolicited Adware interrupting my Internet sessions (especially something called “Rockettab”), I sprang for McAfee “Total Protection” thinking it would fix my problems.  Imagine my surprise when this virus protector software passed this, and most of my other, problems off as “non-virus” issues.  When I “Goggled” McAffee & “Blocking Rockettab”, I found  a McAffee web page that pointedly acknowledged that they did not view Adware as viruses!  Say, what?  I BEG TO DIFFER!  At any rate I found an alternate virus software that booted “Rockettaab” (i.e., its alias files) and 360+ Adware and spy software viruses to boot (that McAffee did not find).  My initial reaction is McAffee failed to offer the user enough protection."
2,"Quicken works...that's the big plus I have for this.  Unfortunately, I migrated from Microsoft Money which worked better.  This is the only real game in town.<br /><br />On the plus side:  It interfaces nicely with my online banking.<br /><br />On the negative side:  The user interface is clunky and feels like a program from 1995.  There is very little customization compared to what I was accustomed to with Money.  Also, I have to be very dutiful in my balancing as the program wants to autobalance from online records and, if you balance with a paper statement, it screws up and cannot reconcile the difference between a paper statement and the online balances, even though you manually enter the dates and balances.<br /><br />Microsoft!  Why have you abandoned me!"
1,"After doing a Registry cleaning, my computer crashed as I've got to assume that the software had removed some files which might have been critical to the proper function of the computer; but I was fortunate in that the computer was able to recover without needing a re-install of the OS as I would be extremely cautious in using the registry cleanup as it is NOT something I would recommend."
4,"Amazon offers the lowest price for this product anywhere around. Even the Microsoft website charges five dollars more. Most retail stores try to sell it for $100 plus tax!<br />You get all of the Microsoft 365 applications plus 20 more Gigabytes of SkyDrive storage. Microsoft gives 7 for free, so you get a grand total of 27 Gigabytes. This is enough cloud storage for almost anybody.<br />You also get two installs that can be used anywhere and changed anytime. If you install it on a desktop and later decide to buy a new computer, you can use the Office website to change the license over to the new one. I did this, and it took less than two minutes.<br /><br />The purchase was fast, the installation was easy, and the setup was simple. During the checkout process, you must validate that you are a student. Really, anyone with access to an email address ending in '.edu' can purchase this product. I repeat, anyone with access to a '.edu' email address can purchase and use this software. If you have a friend or a family member with one, it only would take five minutes of their time to validate the purchase. You will never need that email address again after you first purchase it.<br />Things to remember: This is a four year subscription, all the other subscriptions expire after one year and cost more. In that four years, you get all the new updates Microsoft has to offer as well.<br />This is truly a special deal."
0,"Adobe, when will you listen to us? This subscription model is terrible. You are forcing me to find an alternative. Everyone else will find an alternative, and that will become the standard. It won't take long."
1,"I have used Quicken since 1994 and upgraded it several times. My current version is 2011. The 2014 version has failed to convert my data to the new format. It just says it failed to convert and gives you no options. After several attempts, running the file repair in 2011 version and reinstalling I have gone back to 2011. Waste of 40 bucks"
2,"The software runs extremely well but lacks in professional behaviors.  No scrolling in real time,  No independent windows.  Editing is simple and efficient and light on the file structure (a good thing)."
2,its ok
2,"It is nice to install the anti-virus software on three devices, but it has been less effective dealing with internet threats."
3,"I wasn't crazy about the price but have been waiting for a version that could connect with investment accounts.  This version, although not perfect, is a great step in the right direction compared with the Essentials I've been saddled with for years.  I hope the promise of continued improvements is fulfilled."
0,"I wrote a review this morning and finally talked with someone about my pc download purchase of mcafee antivirus and I am getting a refund. It's a one time refund on downloaded purchases, but I learnt my lesson. Amazon made good on this."
0,"well, i guess this is overkill. i wish i'd looked at these reviews before i'd bought.  i don't know how anyone could see these reviews and buy this product, but i've got to vent somewhere.  many hours spent trying to fix the problems led nowhere, but they had the nerve to say they'd guarantee to solve all my problems if i paid an additional $199 a year.  i guess one is born every minute, but at least i didn't go for that.  they wouldn't give me a refund within thirty days of my download, supposedly because i'd purchased it earlier. and trying to understand their accents is no joyride, either.  but hey if you buy this product, i guess another one was just born."
1,"Error-prone, too many bugs, cumbersome. I've since switched to iBank 5.x and am very happy that I did."
0,stop including efile in the cost of the program. the gov allows FREE efile if you are under a specific salary.
3,I have happily used the H&R Block software for the past three years; no complaints here.
2,I have used Norton 360 for several years now and was completely surprised to see than my online license renewal increased from $34 last year to $79 this year.  To make matters worse when I started looking for a better renewal price I found out that Norton discontinued the 360 product as of September this year and are replacing it with a product called &#34;Norton Security 2014&#34;.  To add another insult I found this new product online for $39.99.<br /><br />In my opinion Norton is taking advantage of longtime customers and obviously the high Norton renewal price is to get you to switch to the new Norton product.  I even complained to customer support as to why they would let me renew my old discontinued product for twice the price of the new one and their responses were very none committal and they didn’t say much.  I felt so taken advantage of that I switched to Kaspersky pure 3.0 and still had 20 days left on my Norton license.
1,So do you like Photoshop 7?  Yeah... This is NOTHING like that.
2,"I like my 2010 version much better. This one is clunkey and hard to work with. Unforyunately, I have to have it for work so I'm dealing with it."
4,"This software is great for my little animations I make, plus it is very easy to make a great animation. I love this software and I would recommend this to any beginners in animation and even experienced animators! Thanks and have a nice day!"
4,".............a giant in the PC Virus-Deterrent era. Simply goes about its business silently in the background without any cumbersome interruptions and, more importantly, no weighty update issues. Would fully and highly recommend this software."
2,"I never experienced any crash, product has always been stable on my system. That being said I am still mourning the disappearance of MS Money; portfolio X-ray is a good tool but of very limited interest to me as the program cannot handle my foreign investments.<br />Credit Score feature will be a nice-to-have addition for someone who want to closely monitor their ratings. Some bugs should have been fixed a long time ago, like access to split when editing one instance of a recurring bill; exporting to Excel is very awkward.<br />My small business carries an inventory, so Quicken cannot handle that either.<br />I just do not have time to invest in researching another solution."
0,"Admittedly this is not a review of the product, since I CANNOT ACCESS IT. I downloaded it a few days ago, tried 3 times to install and run it on my own, then spent a few hours on the phone with Amazon. They couldn't figure it out, so they sent me to Rosetta Stone. Spent an hour on the phone with Rosetta Stone, they couldn't figure it out. They told me they had to \\""escalate\\"" the issue and send it to someone else - and those people won't be around till tomorrow. I said that was unacceptable. I purchased the product on Thursday, it was supposed to be immediately available - it's now Saturday and I still can't access it. I need to be using the product for work. This has been an extremely frustrating process and to say I'm unsatisfied with the product would be an understatement."
4,"Use it every year, best software out there."
3,The process from beginning to the end was smooth.  I haven't had any issues with this product and any previous years of this item.
3,"About  a  year  ago  I  had  problems  with  installation, but  this  year  everything  went  smooth. Has  been  using  norton  for  years  and  it's  a  good  choice."
0,"I also purchased this product and am now stuck with 2 super slow computers. The product is a disgrace to Amazon and AVG as it is not performing as the other AVG software I have had. I did see on the software that this one is from someplace different than the regular AVG is from. If Amazon does not cover us on this then I will go elswhere and get proper security for my computer, this software is miserable! Slow slow slow! Don't purchase it as you will be replacing it."
4,"I got this program for my 12-year old son.  He had previously been using the 'Sponge Bob' typing program and I didn't think that that program was working well.  In comparison, 'Typing Instructor' is much better.  It presents lessons in a logical manner, monitors progress well and has a reward system that motivates even a 12-year old to keep practicing.  I was initially afraid that the program wouldn't be 'fun enough' for my son, be he seems to like it.  For the price, it's a great deal."
3,works ok
0,Not MacBook compatible!
0,"1. After two days, I have not succeeded to install the State module. The download for the 'bundle' actually only installs the Federal component. To install the state module, you need to enter a user ID and password within the software. These are not created as part of the Federal install, but rather you independently go to the TaxACT website to create these. However, I have done this, yet when I enter the user ID/password in the software to 'automatically' install my state module, my credentials are not recognized.  2. I started working on my Fed return. I am besieged with long-winded 'guidance' rather than being asked a series of clear questions about my situation that would let the software decide on the correct course for me. Surprisingly, I am not interested in becoming an authority on the arcana of tax law so I try to skim the guidance and work out if anything is actually relevant to me.  Edit: TaxACT customer service told me that they can't solve my problem and I should get a refund from Amazon, and download from their website instead. Thanks Amazon - refund was no problem. I certainly won't be downloading this misleadingly advertised software from their website. I'll try different software instead."
3,For the cost you can get a basic program to work you dreams. It perfect to develop a base to give to the experts. Loving it!
3,I've used Quicken for years. I usually update every couple of years to get current.
0,"If you bought last years Bitdefender from AVANGATE.COM, through Paypal and don't want to renew, here's what you need to do.<br />1) log into Avangate.com. If you didn't start an account like I didn't, check the box that says you forgot your password to get it going.<br />2) uncheck/disable the renewal and press save. They should send you a confirmation email. I got one.<br />3) Call paypal (don't fret, it's really easy) and tell them you heard that company can still get your money through them and they will fix it<br />  so that Avangate can't touch your money.<br /><br />Paypal explained that when I bought my first Bitdefender from Avangate, I made an agreement to let them renew it through my Paypal<br />account. Of course, like many of you, I don't remember such a thing. I don't know how these sneaky thieves legally get away with this.<br />I think THEY set it up, then send you a reminder email that they will be renewing it for you (which they did with me) and you either think<br />to yourself that they won't do it because you didn't agree to it (which you didn't) or you stop this &#34;legal crime&#34; by doing the simple three<br />steps above. Good Luck!"
1,"My office currently uses Office 2010 but the only available Publisher was 2013, so I purchased and downloaded Publisher 2013.  I had issues registering online as prompted and had to call Microsoft. I was eventually able to register it, and open it, but that's when my troubles started. I could not open my existing MS Office products; I kept getting a message that my license key could not be verified. It took four hours of dealing first; with my IT guy, and than MS support to get my Office 2010 to work again. But when I tried opening Publisher again there was that message again, &#34; a license key could not be verified&#34;. I am now waiting for our IT guy to log in and figure out what is going on. So much for easy installation."
3,"While it's a little too early to be sure yet, this product looks like it'll be just what I need. I have used TurboTax for the past 15 years or so, but was disturbed by what they did this year. Usually, I would get their Basic or Deluxe version and would make do with their minimal advice that I needed to fill out a simple Schedule C. This year (2014) they were going to force me to get their most expensive version (Home and Business) to do my Sch.C. Totally unreasonable. So I have switched. My initial experience with H&R has been favorable. The software didn't take very long to download, it installed cleanly (Windows 7), and imported the info from my TurboTax 2013 file with no complaints. Maybe it's just because it's different, but I liked the H&R inquiry pages better than TurboTax's; they seem more direct and cleaner (not so many unnecessary graphics). TurboTax seemed to be getting kludgier and kludgier every year. At this point, anyway, I'm kind of glad they finally made switching such an easy decision."
0,"Intuit has very poor customer service.  Our QuickBooks would not let us login so we called customer service.  After 4 hours he fixed it but told me if I upgraded to a higher level for $1700.00 I would not have this problem so I paid for it over the phone and he was to call me back the next day to install the next level of QB.  He never called the next day, I called customer service back and they told me I didn't need the next level and that the salesman scanned me ( the customer service reps exact words about his fellow rep).  Scanned Me!!! He put his supervisor on the phone and she told me she was issuing a refund.  Meanwhile QB stopped working again the next day.  Was on the phone for 5 hours that day only to end up hiring an IT guy on my own to come fix my QB.  A week later I called because I never received my refund only to find out they never processed the refund.  So, I was scanned, still have not received my refund, and I had to hire an IT guy to fix my QuickBooks.  Very poor customer service."
0,Awful product
3,Have been a Quicken user for many years and with each new upgrade I find it easier to use and added features fit my needs well.
1,"It's just okay, worked well enough for what I needed but it was difficult to use and navigate. Also didn't have a lot of things previous ones have had. Not impressed"
0,"So much for Avast being a good player...I was trusting it to remove Firefox addons with bad reputations, but it replaced my custom Firefox homepage of multiple tabs with a Yahoo search only."
1,"I've been using Turbo Tax for the last several years and saw this for 50% off so thought I'd give it a shot.  The import function works properly, but the 'help' links pop up a blank box (and I've run updates three times to see if anything ever shows up), you have to manually go to each form to fill it in, etc.  It doesn't ask questions for you to click yes or no, except on personal details at the very beginning.  How am I supposed to know which forms I need to 'go to,' I didn't write the program!  I'm thinking the refund will be about the same, but since I can't figure out how to do my rental income and expenses for upkeep on my rental property, I'm stuck with having to get a version of Turbo Tax anyway, since this information didn't import.  For the free state/federal filing if you don't have rental properties, you'd be okay getting the basic version and saving yourself some $$$."
4,"Since installing Avast in our computers years ago, we have been virtually problem free.<br />Sometimes we make a mistake by going somewhere we shouldn't, but I know Avast is always watching over us.<br /><br />I recommend Avast to everyone who tells me they're having issues with their computers.<br />Avast is the best thing on the web, especially at no cost!<br /><br />Long live Avast!"
1,"I thought I would stick it to Intuit and use H&R Block software this year. I really wish I hadn't. I've used Turbox tax for more than 5 years and found it's navigation and interviews much more intuitive than the H&R Block product. The icing on the cake, H&R Block DOES NOT include local tax paperwork (something that TurboTax has always had). I called their support and confirmed that it is not included in any of their products. I ended up paying someone to prepare my local taxes (part-year resident is a mess). I really wish I could do it all over again."
3,"I like this Security S/W, clean interface, has kept my PC clean so far. Easy to install but an e mail I sent to G Data was never answered."
4,"I use Photoshop AND Paintshop.  There are just some things in Paintshop that Photoshop doesn't have (and visa versa).  As a newer photographer, Photoshop is more for the advance user.  Paintshop is for the everyday user at home and it is easier to figure out than Photoshop is.  When I got my Paintshop, it came with Facefilter...not necessary, but was really fun to play with.  It's a program that gives makeup/makeovers for photos a boost.  I had a photo where a girl looked like she had bruises around her eyes.  She was very blonde so you could not see her brows.  In Facefilter, I was able to add realistic looking brows and in Paintshop I used the makeup touchup tool to get the bruises out from her eyes--the photo looked MUCH better with those touch ups.  I highly recommend this software and for the price, you just can't beat it (the Corel site still sells it for almost $80)."
1,"WARNING - The most important features of this software are STRIPPED.  NO H264 rendering - NO Hi Def. (1080/720p) MP4 rendering, NO AVC rendering, and NO 4K rendering........ so you will NEVER know how well (or how poorly) this software may perform.  In fact, you cannot open a 4K file in any PowerLESS Director suite to know how the video playback performs during editing... a CRITICAL function which separates good software from bad.<br /><br />It feels as though Cyberlink does NOT want you to know if there are any &#34;jittering video&#34; issues when viewing and editing large files.<br /><br />I like the work flow and appearance of this software, BUT I JUST DON'T TRUST IT since I can not actually use any of it in the trial.<br /><br />TERRIBLE TRIAL SOFTWARE..... Fix this issue, Cyberlink, or nobody will buy your products."
4,grat
3,"I haven't had it that long, but so far it is working great. I am kinda of a klutz when it come to using a program and I have found so far Q 14 is very user friendly, I say more than any previous version."
2,I had issues with the software. Blocked my social network sites the first time I tried it. I have had Avast in the past and it worked fine but this time I have windows 8.1 and I think that  was causing me issues with this software.
2,I expected Premier to handle more complex tax problems than it can and found it awkward  to use. Found I had to read tax codes and make my own interpretations. On line questions were never answered. There must be something better and I will search for it next year.
3,"I've used H&R Block tax software for more than a decade. I keep using it because it works. The question are not difficult to follow and answers to questions are generally quickly available. We own a home, have some rental property and two kids and H&R software aeems to ask all of the right qurstions. I find this software to be consistent and reliable. It is a great deal for the purchase price."
2,After looking at it did not use
1,"I just downloaded this from Amazon, and so far it is pretty lame.  Firstly, no activation code.  Went to online chat and was 145 in the queue!!  Feeble..."
2,Working as intended.  Software can be great with more options.
1,Too confusing for me.....decided not too purchase
0,Very poor quality font resolution and seems like I'm reading a blurry page. I wish there is a way to get my money refunded.
1,"The Quick books product itself is good. That support cost more than the software is bad. That two days after I registered the software and every day since, we have been slammed by vendors calling to sell us credit card processing and other services is terrible. All of the spam phone calls have been for services that we declined during the REQUIRED registration phone call, which was more of a sales pitch. In between every question verifying the purchase the Intuit Rep tried to sell us another service, despite our repeated attempts to decline all such additional products.   If you can manage the software it is good, if you need to call for help plan to add a lot to your budget."
0,"I wasted my money on this product.  It kept telling me I needed to do an update before I could file a federal return.  I would do the update, try to proceed - only to get the same message again.  I was unable to use the product and had to spend money for a different product."
0,Product key did not work.
4,"I have been looking for a great electronic cookbook for all of my wife's old manual file recipes and Cook'n has filled the need.  Not only is the Cook'n software easy to use when installing the recipes, but I now can carry the recipes with us when we travel.  They are on my iphone, ipad, and laptop.<br />With all of the recipes on the iphone, it makes it very convenient to shop at the grocery store and purchase everything that is need for the evening meal. Even my son, who lives 600 miles away has a copy of all the recipes on his note book.  The support team at Cook'n has been great to work with.  Their response time to any problem that arose was addressed with in 24 hours of my request. They believe strongly about their software and want to the customer to be just excited about using it.<br />Bottom line is &#34;If you want at great electronic recipe fie at your finger tips, you should really take a good look at the Cook'n program.&#34;"
2,"Product is good. Have used it for my business since it came out. But don't count on good support. Downloaded and installed software. Software loaded data and reconfigured it for the new version. When I restarted software, it came back with an error. Since I understood I had free support with initial install, I called support. First thing they wanted to do was sell me a support package. I said why would I want to buy package when software doesn't work yet. So after giving him the error message number on screen, he came back to tell me to send data file and $300 and they would fix data error that wasn't there when I started. I said I'd think about it and hung up. I played around and then reloaded software and reloaded data and everything was fine. So the moral of the story is don't believe everything Support says and restart/reload software and see what you get."
2,I was very angry that I was instructed to download delux turbo jn the middle of  completeing my return for one entry.
3,It's an improvement over Quicken 2007 but takes getting used to since I've been using Quicken 2007 for many years.
0,"This McAfee should be called a Virus rather than an AntiVirus. I have used McAfee before and have never been pleased with it and now with this I am completely out for life with McAfee. This is seriously a useless software that I cant even stress enough. I installed this product and ran a scan, it said your computer is secure and then it keeps detecting this annoying virus which needs to be quarantined and I kept doing that for days and it still keeps popping up and so I called customer care.Oh boy I dont know why I even called them like most of these companies the customer service is completely uselss. They put you on hold for hours and if u stay that way they will put you on hold until u die of old age. Bottom Line I m out and so should you."
4,"I got what I wanted from this. It protects what it can, and I'm alright with that."
2,I love the program and have been using it for over 10 years.  the only problem i have is several times during a return the system will just shut down my computer. i have had three different computers during this time frame and it has happened each year. i must save after every step so when my computer goes blank and i have to restart i can return to the same step I've  completed. it gets very frustrating but i keep using because it seems to very accurate and comprehensive.
2,"I have been exclusively using Quickbooks for my personal and my business finance management software for about 10 years, having having set aside Quicken for QB when left my own consulting firm and join an international organization.  When I left that company to return to my own practice, I thought I would keep my business on QB and my personal finances on Quicken.  Much has changed in Quicken, or perhaps I am viewing it through my QB lens.<br /><br />It works well, but only after searching vainly through the odd menu structure to find what I am looking for.  It is comparable to the Microsoft Office shift from 2003 to 2007 and it's counter intuitive menu ribbon.  I almost choked on that ribbon!  I was a user of every Word and Access version from DOS 1.0 through to the Windows 2003 version.  Hated the ribbon.  Nearly wore out the F1 key looking for things that had been well structured on the menu tree,<br /><br />Ditto with Quicken.  Too much illogic in the multiple menus and tabs.  Ok, sure.I should read the what's different about this version.  But having skipped almost 10 versions, that did not seem very useful.  Perhaps the current operational approach is best for the newbie.  It is making this accounting guy crazy!"
3,"Safe, quick and easy to use program. It cover a huge variety of viral propaganda. Well worth it's weight in gold!"
4,"Best free anti-virus software available today.  Saved my computer countless times!<br /><br />Additionally:<br />- Real-time protection, controlled by you<br />- Very minimal software conflict possibility, never had to turn off antivirus to install anything<br />- Frequent updates, protection from viruses, trojans and spyware<br />- Interface is attractive looking and very user friendly<br />- Offers Premium service options, but never forces you to buy them<br />- Frequent promotions on premium services, priced very reasonably if you choose to buy those<br />- Does not force tons of bloatware \\""partner\\"" software under the radar<br />- Has not gone out of business after all these years!"
2,Never used it after I got it.  Did not have what I needed as far as presenting a good resume
1,"While the software is fairly straight forward, the instructions are sometimes unclear and confusing. For the state program, its $20 extra to file, and its pretty much useless as one has to enter a great majority of the information manually directly on the state form, without any guidance of what each field means, which beats the purpose of buying a software to help you. Because all of these reasons, the software is not worth the cost."
1,"When I started entering web addresses using Safe Money, about 1/5 of them became blocked and I could not access them. I have called the web address owners (stores, credit cards, etc) and even though they unblocked the accounts I am still not able to access the accounts on-line. I keep getting a message from Kaspersky that says the web address is not available. Now I can not make payments on-line, which it creates a problem for me. Also, I followed the instructions to install the software in mobile devices and it did not work. I have tried unsuccessfully to speak to someone at Kaspersky but there is no way one could speak to a person. As a last resort I am going to delete the Kaspersky Internet Security software from my computer and try accessing the credit card accounts without the internet security. Purchasing and installing this software has become a headache. I do not recommend it."
0,It does not work to clean viruses
2,It's Okay. It freezes frequently.  It 's okay for writing short letters and notes. I don't see it as something for writing long papers or reports.
4,I really like this product. Its easy to set up and very operable. I would recommend the Publisher 2013 to anyone.
4,Way better than norton or any other I have tried. This is the best hands down. Love it and its free
1,"I brought this thinking I can fill in the gaps from the mint.com site and to capture better details on my financials.<br />The upcoming bills and trending options are good, but for overall functionality; this isn't worth more than the cost of a $10 app.<br />Pending transactions aren't captured and from my experience, it couldn't consistently pull the info from some of my accounts. It didn't recognize Citibank credit card information  and when you pay a bill, you have to wait for it to show up in the bank info otherwise it will capture the info X2 if your not careful during the upcoming bill validation.<br />There is potential for the application but it seems rushed with little / no functionality updates.<br />Likewise it is very time extensive trping the information that it doesn't capture or miss by hand.<br />I now use mint.com, and evernote to capture my spend and tracking for the main bills. Until they make this more reliable and user friendly, it definitely isn't worth the cost or effort."
4,This program I use annually to get my taxes done and always purchase it online just before I need it every year.
1,"I don't feel any improvement of my PC at all. After I install on my PC, I do not see any notification or command from AVG to perform any tune up action to my PC. As a result I did not see any significant improvement on my PC. I am disappointed by this AVG product."
0,Product has less features vs. 2013.
2,"The computer works very well, better than before.  However, I keep getting messages telling me that my computer is at risk!  I don't know if Norton has protected me or not.  So far, I have had no trouble."
4,Perfect.  Exactly what I was after at a very attractive price.  Thanks amazon for a straight forward purchase and download.
3,"After couple weeks of trying it out, Intuit seems to have gotten it right this time.  Still not all of the functionality of the PC version, but all the functions I need and a much better user interface."
4,I have been using PC Matic for over a year and love it.  I just renewed and shared the great protection with my husband.
3,"I've been using Quicken for over 20 years. 2012 was the first version I did not upgrade to because there was no major upgrades to the features I know and love (I use everything but budgeting). I was discouraged from buying this release when it first came out because of all of the negative reviews. I have now been using it for over 5 months (I installed it in late December). I am glad some of you gave a \\""heads up\\"" regarding the password issue. I deleted my vault password and installed the software. But other than that, it installed flawlessly. It converted my data flawlessly and I have a VERY large data file (20 years worth). I found it fast with none of the delay issues noted in the other reviews. The mobile version is not as useful as I would have hoped and pray that Intuit has the forethought to see that mobile is the future and continues to work on this. I would have given it 5 stars if not for this. But I am puzzled by the number of negative reviews. If you want to see your financial information all under one roof and have it a click away, this is the software to get."
2,Works
0,I was looking for a basic checkbook with categories.  I could not find anyplace to have categories.  I found a free checkbook software on the internet that was very basic but at least had categories.
1,Quicken is a monopoly.  Please work with another vendor to come up with competition for Quicken!!!  Too expensive for what it does.  Tax software is much better and costs less money.
3,"It does it's job... I took 1 star off for the following reason:<br />The past few years I've used H&R Block Online, essentially this and the online version are almost identical, except the online version is &#34;cloud based&#34; vs. this one saves to your PC. The software went on sale so I bought it (better deal then the online variant for the same service).<br /><br />So I took a star off, because the online version and the software version do NOT talk to each other (I hope they fix this), since I've always done it via the online version it would carry my info over from previous years - this software does the same thing providing you use the software version each year. Since I went from online to software, however I had to re-enter everything from scratch. Seeing how similar both products are I don't understand why H&R block can't download your online filing(s) in to the software version and vice versa it would be a great feature if the software version saved a copy for safe keeping and continuity back to HR block cloud for safe keeping and interoperable if you opt to go back to online next year."
4,"I've previously paid for McAffee, Norton and Kaspersky antivirus over the years and I've found Avast at least as good if not better in terms of detecting viruses and ease of use."
4,Downloading was easy.
4,The antivirus that performs the service for which it is designed.<br />I have used it for several years without any mishaps.<br /><br />Thank you
2,Taxes still a little confusing
1,download was good<br />After purchase help no where to be found.<br />Not intuitive<br />BIG learning curve!!!!!!<br />Worst Software product I have ever purchased.
2,"I've trusted TurboTax for the past 7 years now but its getting more and more difficult to justify doing it myself compared to paying a local company.  We live on a border town and my spouse works in another state.  $40 more for the additional state plus 2, $19.99 e-file fees along with $50 for the software is just under the cost at a local firm.  I really wish they would start offering options that would save money.  Sure you can print it and mail the states in and save the $40 but very few users would want to wait."
4,Very good
1,"I'm a long-time Quicken user (I started using it more than 15 years ago), who left a few years ago after being irritated and disappointed with Intuit's strategy of forcing upgrades by disabling automatic downloads to older versions of the product.  I recently have started trading stocks more actively, and decided that I'd give the product another chance to take advantage of it's record-keeping ability.  I have to say overall, I'm quite disappointed.  The basic product has hardly changed since the last version I used (2006, I think). Furthermore, it wont download automatically from several of my account (e.g., my Optionshouse trading account, my Schwab 401k account)  The record-keeping is useful, but the fact that it won't \\""talk to\\"" all of my account is quite frustrating. Free online services (such as Yodlee, or Intuit's own Mint) do a better job of acquiring this data, and don't extort money for this service.  I think this last purchase has soured me on Intuit's product forever. With the new tax laws requiring brokerages to maintain capital-gains information for their customers, the need for this product no longer is strong enough for me to put up with its shortcomings.  (P.S. as a positive note: I do appreciate having software like this available for purchase in download form)."
2,I was disappointed.  I had used Turbo Tax for the previous 6 years and had no problem with it.  This year they did not include the State Tax forms.  They wanted and additional $39.99 for the State Forms.  I was not happy. I really like Turbo  Tax but felt like I was cheated this year.  There were no notices sent out about it.
0,"Con: Doesn't work. I get a dialog box &#34;A new version is available. Would you like to download?&#34;, which is not really a question, since the only choice one has is to click &#34;Install update&#34;, after which 98Mb of data are downloaded (every single time), after which I am presented with the message &#34;An error occurred while extracting the archive. Please try again later.&#34;. Pro: fails very reliably."
2,"Does it's job well I suppose, far too many pop ups and suggestions and annoying content.  Just keep it simple, unobtrusive, and in the background.  If it gets much more in your-face-look-at-me I'll simply replace it with something less intrusive."
0,It would not let me download it. Lept giving me a pdf of how to download it and even going step by step i was not able to. I was hoping to get a good deal on norton but i was pretty disappointed
4,This software works well and keeps my computers safe from harm. Does not slow down my computer like some of the antivirus software does. Amazon has the best price on these and love that I can just directly download after buying ~ a huge plus!
3,Excellent product. Unfortunately it cannot be supplied outside of the US. European customers like me have to be &#34;creative&#34; to get it. But as they say: if there is a will one can find a way.
1,"This was my first time trying out turbotax and it seemed like it was doing a good job, but at the end, it told me that I'd have to pay an extra $25 to finish filing my taxes. I was under the impression that \\""Fed + Efile + State\\"" meant that it would efile both my federal and state taxes. It did give me the option to print and mail my state taxes, but that just seems like a waste of paper. I ended up not using it for the state return and instead filed through my state's website. The whole ordeal feels very much like a bait & switch tactic, and I don't think I'll be buying TurboTax again."
3,"After cleaning up my PC, this seemed to work fine, so I've changed my review and added a few stars."
2,"The reason why we have to file taxes is because of Intuit. They make bank off having people pay for state tax e-filing - even with the title of the software being as it is, it does not include state e-filing. It can do them, and you can print them out, and mail them in, but it's $20 to file state taxes electronically and this goes to Intuit, not the state or federal government.<br /><br />Changing jobs, dumping my 401K after having taken off and not paid back entirely a couple 401K loans, I wanted to make it more painless. It did do that. I'll get this next year as well, but only to compare to what I've done every year - filed them myself...and see if the numbers are different...and WHY."
4,"every year, we order the turbo-tax, and it alway have a high level of success. thankyou  james."
0,"Last update Release 15 (R15) – March 4, 2015 causes program to crash on restart! Was working fine with previous updates."
0,It won't sync with my bank so it is now totally worthless to me.  Waste of money glad I didn't buy it at full price.
0,"I use PowerPoint, Word, and Excel quite regularly at work.  I picked up 365 through Microsoft's website so I could edit document on my home computer.<br /><br />In sum, the product is absolutely horrible.  By default printing brings you to OneNote, not the printer.  If you print from OneNote it prints a bunch of other stuff you didn't need printed.<br /><br />Word and PowerPoint also have crippling less functionality.  You can no longer right click and add rows to tables, nor right click to delete comments or much anything else.  You have to instead go up to the top and navigate and try to find what you need under something convoluted like \\""Layout\\""<br /><br />You can no longer control click and align tables/pictures in word.  Can't even control click multiple items from what my most recent experience has been.<br /><br />I will definitely be canceling my subscription and ensuring that the office never upgrades to 2013 products."
4,As always a very helpful tool
2,"I've been using Quicken since it originally was introduced many years ago.  I appreciate being able to manage all my finances in a single place, download the transactions across all my accounts, and create reports that show how and where I spend my money.  However, what I don't appreciate is being pretty much forced to now upgrade Quicken on an annual basis, whether I want to or not.  I was running Quicken 2014, which I only installed about 6 months ago.  As usual, the endless reminders about needing to upgrade to Quicken 2015 started at the beginning of January.  Unchecking the dialog box that says, &#34;Remind me later.&#34; is meaningless, since the same dialog box will then come up each time you open Quicken, regardless of what you've checked.  Therefore, to stop that irritation, I went ahead and bought Quicken 2015, which looks pretty much like Quicken 2014 to me.  Which looked pretty much like Quicken 2013.  Intuit should just announce that Quicken is now an annual license and quit fooling around like this.<br /><br />Here's a useful tip for anyone that is planning to upgrade from Quicken 2014 to Quicken 2015.  If your Quicken password has special characters in it ($, #, @, etc.) CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD TO REMOVE THOSE CHARACTERS IN QUICKEN 2014 BEFORE YOU LOAD QUICKEN 2015!  Otherwise, during the installation of Quicken 2015, your Quicken 2014 installation will be completely removed.  You will then try to open your Quicken data file in Quicken 2015 and you will be told your password is invalid.  You will try it about 10 more times before you refer to the Intuit site for help.  You will then find a lot of useless posts on how to change your password on Intuit.com, but nowhere will you be told that the geniuses at Intuit forgot to make sure that Quicken 2015 can open a 2014 file secured by a password with special characters.  This same thing happened a couple years ago, so evidently their learning curve is low.  Your only option at that point appears to be to digout your copy of Quicken 2014, open your Quick data file, change your password to one without special characters, save the file, re-open the file successfully in Quicken 2015, then change your password back to something more secure that uses special characters.  That's super-convenient, isn't it?<br /><br />If you remove the special characters in your password BEFORE you start the installation of Quicken 2015, it should go pretty smoothly for you."
1,McAfee is rated higher and is cheaper.
2,Prices seems to go up every year!
0,Bummer! What a scam. After years feeling confient with TT I am going to buy HR Block's imitation of the OLD TT.
3,"It is a great product but I don't use all of the services. I will use all of them in the future when I live on my own but for now I will only record bank transactions, balance my budget, and check my credit score."
3,good
0,Does not work I have been trying to download it since 10-31-13  will not download any more to much trouble to much going here and on the computer.
3,I would give five star to this product I would have gotten choice to download the thing I need from it.
1,As a long time user of TurboTax Deluxe I was displeased that you deleted capital gains gains/ losses on this years tax return. I am looking forward to having to do considerable work in this area in 2015 tax return. Please replace all the items you deleted in 2014 Deluxe return back into the 2015 Deluxe return. I would hate to change over to Tax Act or another tax filing system next year. Aside from that fact I have always been fully satisfied with your product. .
4,Yes works goo
2,"No virtual key board.  Very difficult to learn how to use.  Trying to get help is a joke.  you have to download a huge manual and work your way through each learning step.  not at all forgiving in trying to load other  Midi instruments, VST files.<br />While some individuals would flourish in the geek to make this work, it is daunting to learn.<br />You are better off using and buying Reaper license  and find easier methods of adding your files and controlling them.  The mastering section is however worthwhile."
3,"An essential purchase, but... 2011? Microsoft, please bring out a refreshed version for Mac, better adapted for retina displays!  :-)"
0,I was a bit apprehensive given the good and bad comments before buying but I was desperate to get it right away so I downloaded it. Unfortunately I should have gone with my gut and ordered the disk and waited a few more days. Still without a computer to this day nearly a month later.
4,"I love how accessible Adobe has made this product with the new subscription model. They used to charge $700 for this product, which I could never afford, but now it's only 10 bucks a month!!! I'm finally able to stop using the cheap photo products and use the real deal."
3,Is not compatible with Google chrome and I was unable to download it. It was a better price than Turbo Tax. I did get a refund.
4,I am very happy with this product I been use it for years I feel very secure and I really trust in this antivirus<br />I recommend ir to family and friends because is easy to use and very nice to understand.
3,"Great tax prep program! I've used it every year since the mid-90's.  There is still some room for improvement.  The program tends not to re-start you at the point where you stopped in the program.  However, the menu tabs are easy enough to guide you back to your stopping point.  Also, there is this &#34;information page&#34; that pops up whenever you open the program.  I constantly have to inform the program that I do not want to fill out that page.  It would be better to say &#34;NO&#34; once and not be bothered with it again.  But, these are minor issues, and overall I think the program is excellent for tax preparation.  I have not compared it to any other tax prep program as I have always been satisfied with using TurboTax."
2,"I started using Quicken in the early 90s when it was DOS version.. most financial institutions were not even offering download of financial data and transactions had to be manually entered.<br /><br />Intuit had a major role in standardizing the OFX standard in 1997. It was breath of fresh air.. suddenly one could download transactions from all Financial institutions in a common format. It worked and worked well. I had so much respect for Intuit for changing the home banking and investment world. They were good! they were the best. They beat Microsoft! and I cheered them big time by upgrading each year!!! However that has changed! all good things come to an end. Quicken is coming to an end.. at least for me. Most functionality is now being provided by individual financial banks/institutions.. it may not be in one place but it is better than using Quicken.<br /><br />The dark side of Intuit is that they are stubborn.. when they decide not to improve something.. that is it..you are stuck with it! Here are some of the features they simply refused to improve:<br /><br />- Reporting - Their reports simply cannot be customized and not much scope within the options they provide. this function sucks sucks and sucks and has sucked from the day one :-( You generate a report and want to customize to you needs - NO WAY!!! all feed back over the years went to arrogant and deaf ears.<br /><br />- Financial Markets analysis - I always bought the Premier version of Quicken. However could never get advanced analysis on investments! If you have to do analysis on your investments e.g. Asset Allocation - forget it. It sucks! I go to Fidelity's web site and get excellent results. I have stopped doing any kind of Financial analysis on Quicken - simply because there are other tools available.<br /><br />- Attachments - For years loyal customers demanded attachments. Finally Intuit agreed - The problem is that even with a slightest mistake with moving files you lose attachments. They may have solved it in 2014, but the new interface sucks!<br /><br />I upgraded to Quicken 2014 - it has no extra features other than Intuit demanding to sync by uploading your financial data to their servers ( pssst - into the cloud.. the new fancy term to give them our data). If you do not want to do this Q2014 has no additional value. This feature allows you to get the financial data over ipad/iphone.. but you got to share the data with quicken. Sorry cannot risk that. Quicken is trying to become Google of financial world. I am not going to risk that. I can easily go to my bank as well as Fidelity's app and get my data on my finances!! Quicken stay away from getting my data on cloud.<br /><br />Latest is that Quicken 2014 hangs hangs and hangs on Windows 7. Try calling their support.. that is another nightmare. That is not how it was in 90s.<br /><br />This is the last upgrade I paid for.. NO More!  I will still use Quicken because it does get me all information to my desktop. but will I upgrade any more ... NO! I wish I could go back to Quicken 2013.. however the evil empire will not let me do that.<br /><br />Quicken.., I have love hate relationship with you. I will continue to use, but do not see any value in upgrading."
4,I am pleased with avast and the security it provides. Although it is only basic and free it does a good job.
3,"I have been playing with version 2014 since it came out  six weeks ago. I have a rather large database for an individual, but the program has been working well until it crashed twice while trying to back-up my data. I was forced to erase the program and install from the original download. I am running Win 7 on a fast AMD chip with 4 gig RAM and 500 gig HD with 50% avail memory."
3,"It is a great tool. Noticeably cheaper than Adobe, but works better than most other lower priced options."
3,Just what I need. This program will help me to track my household savings and spending.  I would recommend Quicken to anyone.
1,"For some reason or other, H&R Block has started this package &#34;Deluxe&#34; which does NOT include state. If you need a state, H&R Block will sell it to you for $35! More than what you'll pay for &#34;H&R Block Deluxe + State&#34;.<br />I called H&R Block and explained - they didn't have any solution!<br />Thankfully Amazon was good - gave me refund and let me buy the correct version."
4,works great
1,"I bought this on intuit site when they have 40% off. I read reviews on Amazon and was hesitate to try but can't find another good software on the market. A free version CashGNU requires too much accounting skills to even set it up. This software is indeed as bad as most of the reviews. My chase bank transactions were duplicated and I have to spend 1 hour removing those duplicates. The mortgage set up is screwed up. Downloaded the loan from BOA and numbers were wrong. Also a numbers of transactions with zero were added for no reason. Mine is updated to R3 and it's still buggy. I gave it an extra stars because of version 2010 that I used which was perfect. I wish there are more competitions on the market so that Intuit can start making innovative products instead of just trying to roll out crappy software every year to make make money. The truth is it takes time to perfect a software but they start deprecate the online banking features after 3 years. If I really want to buy a 90% bug free software, I probably have to wait a year for them to release all bug fixes which mean I am only left with 2 years to use the full features of the software."
1,"This purchase was a major disappointment. Norton Internet Security flagged the downloaded files as having a virus (presumably falsely). This version of Photo Elements has a different interface than all the other previous versions I have owned. It's cumbersome and repetition. When you try to print something from within the program, half of the time only part of the photo prints. Every other program I have, including the previous version of Photo Elements prints perfectly. The default image type is BMP not JPG. When you Save As a JPG the file is almost always corrupt and most programs can't open it. You also still have the default BMP image which you need to manually delete."
1,Both products had software problems. Intuit knew about them. Others complained. The problems went unresolved. Next year I will look at other products.
0,I wish I could get a refund for this product.  It wasn't successful in the editing functions that I wanted to use - just made a mess of my photos.
0,"I have been using Quicken since around 2000, updating about every 2 years.  By far, 2014 v7 is the worst version yet.<br /><br />While most of the normal functions work as well or so as always, I've been getting 2 persistent errors that are driving me nuts lately.<br /><br />I have &#34;reset&#34; the download connections with 2 credit cards 10 times each, getting a &#34;success&#34; message each time.  When I try to download transactions, I keep getting an error message about connectivity problems that prompts me to reset it again and again and again.  Given that one of the major entire points of this software package is to get on-line data, this is a major failure.<br /><br />2, The ledger has math errors.  From time to time, I can update or add a transaction and the total account value at the bottom is wrong.  If I close and reopen the software or if I change the account I am viewing several times, the software finally calculates the balance properly, but it does not appear to automatically always recalculate balances.  Given this is a quasi-accounting software package, I would think that properly performing mathematical functions might be something that the developers would have checked for proper functionality.<br /><br />In short, if you are using 2012 or 2013, don't update until these bugs are fixed.  I wish I could go backwards!"
1,"After I downloaded, I have been having nothing but problems - cannot print, errors, waste of my time & energy."
4,"In the past, I've had problems installing after buying at Amazon, but not this time. As always I'm very satisfied with Norton."
1,"I have used the H&R Block Delux software the past few years, and I liked it.  This year  I had rental income and expenses to report for the first time (damn you airbnb). the listing indicated I need Premium for that.  I read reviews below which indicated that this software does not stand up to the challenge of rental property. But I assumed it was just about property sale. So I went ahead and downloaded it, anyway. Sure enough, the software does not help with the rental income. Form 1099-K is not even listed. I did get to the H&R Block support which comes free with this software. I got a technical suport, not a tax specialist. He did have to do some research and told me that I need to file schedule E. Since that does not pop up automatically during interview, I need to do it manually afterwards. Not sure yet where I report rental expenses, his research did not find that. I will have to figure it out myself, and/or ask for a tax specialist chat, which is also included with this software.<br />Do not waste your money on Premium. As far as I can tell, it has nothing that Delux already had."
1,Did not work at converting AVI files from camcorder....to MP4 files for me
4,"Been using it for years.  This latest version is quite impressive in terms of consuming limited PC resources and with its ability to identify and block harmful threats.  When a &#34;bad&#34; website is encountered, the alarm starts ringing and she says &#34;threat detected&#34;.  Real-time scanning is very effective. Get it!"
4,"I was using this for a number of years now and I am very happy with its performance.  Every pc I repair or upgrade I install the free version and advise all my customers to get the pro version. Great product, keep up the good development work."
0,"You can NOT file any sort of business taxes with this product. It does NOT do a business Form 1065.  If there are 3 products, &#34;Home&#34;, &#34;Business&#34;, &#34;Home & Business&#34; what would you expect?  I for one as a sensible person, would expect &#34;Home&#34; to have everything needed for personal taxes, no matter how wild, or rare. I would expect &#34;Business&#34; to have 100% of business taxes forms, starting with a 1065, and going to the most unique, odd individual requirements.  So if I see &#34;Home & Business&#34; , I fully expect it to be for a business owner, to make their life easier, and purchase one product, and get everything needed to sit down, spend a few hours and pay the IRS it's due for the year.   Instead, I got what had expected to be in the lowest category of &#34;Home&#34;, still requiring at a minimum 1 more purchase, download, installation, and separate program to run and update, to do what I had thought I'd already accomplished.   Their purposeful misuse of the phrase, is meant to imply, that the software does personal taxes, including allowing you to file a K-1. But without actually explicitly saying that, they simply lure you into buying incorrect product.  K-1, I should *#^!^$& hope so, the individual has to file the K-1, that makes it part of personal taxes... What exactly does &#34;Home&#34; edition do then?  I can only assume it does not allow you to file a K-1, I have not purchased &#34;home&#34; edition.    Intuit seriously needs to write better descriptions, I am not the first person to deal with this, and it should be embarrassing for a company handling a significant margin of American's tax finances to not be able to better discern between versions of their software."
2,"My bank account was off by $477 after the data conversion.  One EFT deposit was missing! One EFT charge was missing.  A $522 check was missing from the check register.  It must have changed my printer settings because I had to have Kodak support get that going again.  I had to make a fake deposit to get my new program to balance with my bank.  Luck for Intuit I downloaded and installed this on a week-end (when they are not open) or we would have had quite a conversation.  Fortunately, for them, I had cooled down by the time they got back to work so I figured it would be useless to give them an ear full.  I have used quicken since it first hit the market and have not had a previous problem. There have been a couple glitches but nothing like this.  I converted from their 2009 version to the 2013 version and that may have been part of the problem.  Once I got it all straightened out I do still like the program."
4,It is the best antimalware i have ever used. I think everyone should give it a try. you will like it.
3,It is ok. I bhave a little trouble getting it  to change to  different windows formats.
4,"Excelent sofware. It is very easy to use and it is not expensive.<br />To me it's a syperb video converting software,"
3,Did not eliminate all the virus but is making it work a lot better.
0,"&#34;Upgrading&#34; to Quickbooks Online Plus was way more frustrating than it should be. Just setting it up required several calls into Intuit's always backed up customer service phone system. Hours later, the problem still persisted.<br /><br />Once I got to use it, the experience and usage flow was so sparse and quirky compared to Quickbooks Mac 2014 that it's barely acceptable (I use it for light manufacturing, B2B). I'm seriously investigating how to downgrade.<br /><br />Damn you Amazon for now accepting returns for software!!!"
0,"Yeah, the program does what it is supposed to do - calculate your taxes.  But when you get done, you get nickel-and-dimed to death with added costs to do things like add another state and to e-file to those states.  No, you don't have to pay them to e-file (you can print it all out and mail it in) but you do have to pay them for any additional states.  In the end, I paid $64 for the program, but then had to pay $45 for an additional state (the additional state really costs them 70% of the original cost???) and $25 ($50 total) to e-file each of the two states for a total cost of $159.  I might have been able to take all of my receipts to H&R Block and have them deal with the aggravation for that cost."
3,Very easy to download. And I can protect all my devices.  Love it.
4,"this was an excellent choice , definaly in the future i wil buy more items like this. i love it."
1,I was very surprised that there was and additional charge for the state tax software this year in addition to having to  purchase an upgrade in order to file Schedule D. This was a substantial price increase over previous years
0,"I upgraded from 2013, and there is really nothing different.  Transaction matching is still a mess, I could go on.  Wait to buy.  They are already on R2 and stuff is still not working correctly.    UPDATE:  - Copy/Paste shortcut keys stopped working  - Cannot double click highlight values anymore  - Attachment preview still does not display content of file like it used to in 2013 (not broke, don't fix).  - Credit Score still not working    R4 is now due out soon to fix a major bug introduced in R3.  This is a joke.  last time I buy this app.  I cannot understand how these easy bugs are reintroduced every version.    You should ask Microsoft for their Money 2008 engine and just start from there."
4,"I own my own business, trade some stocks, and have a wife with a regular W2-type job.  This handles everything, and every year they improve the entry process.  I would rather pay a few extra dollars and have the software on MY machine, than in the cloud, especially with taxes (fwiw, I save the files to my cloud storage for safe-keeping, but some things are better run locally, IMO)."
0,"I was eager to get WinDVD loaded so that my airport delays would be a bit less boring.  I hadn't been purchasing the regular updates required by Cyberlink's PowerDVD and so couldn't play any recent blu ray.<br /><br />I downloaded WinDVD from Amazon and installed.  The download was easy.  Upon completing the download, I received the serial key.  Installation was easy.<br /><br />An old blu ray played fine.  Then I tried a Netflix rental of a 2013 release.  WinDVD requested an update.  I attempted the update but received the message that my serial number was invalid.  I uninstalled, reinstalled and repeated this routine twice.  On the third try, WinDVD crashed and closed immediately after loading.<br /><br />Because of Amazon's great return policy, I received a prompt refund.<br /><br />I've uninstalled and will keep looking for some program that does load and stay loaded on day one, doesn't crash when I update the latest patch and ideally doesn't require purchasing a new version once or twice a year.  WinDVD is certainly not that program."
3,"I expected Intego to update itself on a scheduled basis, without my intervention.<br />I came to realize that although I selected autoupdate, it asks my permission to update when updates are identified!<br />This is only a minor inconvenience. Other than that, I am happy to know that I have protection on my Mac like I have on my PCs."
3,"If you are trying to learn Bangla, this is definitely worth purchasing. It is a great multimedia way of learning a language. The program is interactive and a bit entertaining. Not to be used as your only source for learning Bangla, but a good addition."
3,the best as far as I am concerned
1,This software is not what I expected at all. The features I was expecting are not what I was expecting. Do a little research before buying.
3,"I recommend this software for every one,but u should add audio conveter to it . Do that and I would give u 5stars"
3,"Very user friendly.  Plenty of templates for all types of projects.  Universal access cloud drive is nice, too.  I definitely recommend it."
1,Would not accept 1099-MISC forms. Unacceptable for a home tax program.
1,"I ordered the CD from Amazon and it was delivered promptly.  I want to say that I have been using Intuit products for more than a decade.  I installed, or attempted to, my new CD and it returned an error code that there is another version of 2009 Turbo Tax on my computer.  Not so, I have 2008 installed.  A link to \\""repair\\"" this error gave me a 40+ character file to run from the command prompt.  I have a PC with Windows XP.  Surprise of surprises, it didn't work.  The next step they gave me was to download a cleanup utility from Microsoft.  I didn't like that idea so I just removed the 2008 version, I also have '05, '06, and '07 installed, and the 2009 version then loaded.    Seems there is a compatability issue between the two years.  I used the program and it worked after updating online three times.  At the end of the evening my computer wouldn't shut off.  Happens with Win XP.  Turns out that Turbo Tax didn't want to disconnect from the web.  After cleaning things up with Task Manager it shut down.    All of the advertisements and encouragements to upgrade or buy additional products worked fine.    Anyway, next year I will use a different provider's software and probably drop Quicken after 15 years, too, which is another story in itself.  These programs have become huge in size, interfer with other programs, and I don't like paying $40.00 for cripple ware and commercials."
2,"The upgrade went the same as usual. Once again, the One Click does not work for my Wells Fargo account and I have to do the web site two step in order to download my transactions.  I am not sure that I am going to bother to even try to fix it this time - I will just try to get used to using the web site, then my expectations can remain low and I will be happy.  On the plus side, this release does seem more stable than previous releases and it has nice new features that I will need to try.  I like the idea of automatically creating a budget, and it looks like it might be easier to correct by 15 years of Quicken entries to fit."
3,Similar enough to Windows version to minimize learning curve. I miss the keyboard shortcuts that I was used to in the Windows version.
4,does exactly what I need it to.
4,"I feel silly I didn't even know this was a software program until I downloaded it! I thought it was just a downloadable coloring book with blank pages that I could print out but in fact it is a program that lets you pick colors and &#34;color&#34; or &#34;paint&#34; using your mouse. My 2 year-old daughter is crazy about trucks, cars and construction vehicles. This &#34;book&#34; has them all, and then some. I just printed out blank pages for her to color with old fashioned crayons and markers, but when she's a little older I'll let her use my computer and mouse to use the software program!"
0,"win 8.1 x64, quicken h&b. converted a 2013 quicken h&b file.  NAS is synology on DSM 4.1<br /><br />installed, updated, registered.  went fine.<br /><br />closed the file and it would not reopen.  it would only bring up the &#34;restore a file&#34; dialog box.  tried many things, all of which failed or were too unstable to bother with.  copied my problem file to my local drive and all problems went away."
3,Does a great job!
1,The game keeps freezing up and you cannot exit unless you start task manager & shut it down that way. A child cannot go from game to game without constant help.
4,"I have been using Quicken since 1990. I am always behind in upgrading to the latest version. This time I was using 2007 version and I needed to upgrade when I went to Windows 7. I really do like the new features of 2013 much better than 2007. It seems like a cleaner interface and easier to find what I need. My file from 2007 was converted and it works just fine with 2013. All in all, this time Intuit did a good thing."
3,"The download from Amazon was fine - no problems.  Working with a new application can be challenging.  The online help in IBank 5 is  not particularly easy to use, at least that is my experience. And I have not been able to download and save the online user manual. Contacting iggsoftware customer support - well, they do get back to you however, their responses are not helpful but more of an acknowledgement of your request.  iBank 5 may be a good financial management application but if the user finds it difficult to learn and apply, then it's not performing well.  I may be compelled to go back to Quicken.<br /><br />My first review complained about the difficulty downloading the user manual.  Here is the rest of the story:  The iBank 5.0 user manual would not download in a usuable form in my Download folder - always shows Zero Bytes. Other PDFs sometimes do the same when I use Safari. The problem is attributable to Safari (OS X Mavericks 10.9) inability to open some PDFs with Adobe Reader. I worked with an Apple Tech Specialist over the telephone and online and his conclusion is a problem with Safari which will be passed along to Apple's developers apparently. As a solution I downloaded Firefox which will be used for PDFs and it works fine. The problem is NOT with iBank 5.0 -- it works just fine and now, with Firefox, I can access the user manual easily.  My satisfaction with iBank continues to increase the more I use it and I will not return to Quicken.<br /><br />See comments for how the original post evolved to this revised version."
4,I like free things
1,"I tried this program after a stitching program I had been using became useless when I upgraded to Windows 8.  Evaluation - average at best.  While the program stitches photos together, the resulting stitched-photo loses significant definition, having been saved by the program with much less data together than the original photos separately."
3,"Read all the instructions, then sort out your folders..FIRST. Now, I am a fan and my desk is clear. I would like to get a second one for my wife but the price has gone up."
1,Same as the free version was a bit disappointed. But it keeps viruses off my laptop so it's not worthless
1,I figured I'd go with TurboTax because my bank uses it and I can upload/download data to/from the account.  Aside from that this software didn't offer much more than I could get with TaxAct which I've used for over ten years.  It doesn't make doing your taxes any easier...
1,I'm not sure why this  is still listed but it is unavilable for download. do not waste your time tryimg to hook that up...
1,"Very glitchy software. Many issues and way too many updates. I only bought it because it was on the deal of the day. Last year was H&R Block and that was issue laden. Why can't someone just come up with a basic, working tax software... or FLAT TAX!!!! (sorry... had to)"
4,We've used Webroot for several years. Never had any virus bring down our computers yet. Thank you Amazon for a great price!
0,Bought it to convert Quicken for Windows to my Mac. Could not import the data files. Makes it useless until I can get the data loaded.
0,"As soon as there is a Mac alternative I will switch immediately.<br /><br />The product is buggy, it doesn't match same day / same dollar transfers to accounts, when you do import the check descriptions don't match what is on line at the bank (meaning every check you import as the same description as the first check you imported).<br /><br />The reporting functions are essentially useless, and there is no customization.  That wouldn't be so bad, except there is NO WAY to export data into excel or some other tool.<br /><br />In version 5 they changed all the icons to the same idiotic gray interface that Apple is moving toward.  This makes it much more difficult to use than previous versions.  What's next, making all the apps in the iTunes store and all the Album covers grayscale?<br /><br />Reconciling is extremely difficult because iBank doesn't recognize transfers from one bank account to another, even in the same bank.<br /><br />I am a 20 year mac user, and have used iBank off and on since version 3, I had high hopes for version 5.  At this point I'm ready to go back to quicken and install parallels on my mac just to run a real, functional financial software package."
1,"A terrible program compared with what they used to make.  I had every year from 2005 to 2009 and they were all great very useful tools, but this one stinks.  It is barely usable at all."
0,I am requesting a refund. I wanted to convert my personal DVD movie collection to my itunes so I could watch movies during travel. Every one comes up protected and will not convert. Don't waste your money.
0,"This product makes me frustrated. It is very complicated when you install it. Even though you try to follow its instruction, you will hardly to do. And you come online to ask for support, it would take you for hours. Should not buy it. Don't be fool by this product!!!"
3,I had to redownload  this twice but the second time it worked the way it should but it ment losing a lot of work
2,"Check register would not run to current date.  After working through much community advice as to the nature of the problem, and the problem was not resolved, I decided to uninstall the new Quicken and order another download.  The extra $40 would be cheaper than having my technician come and fix the problem!  Wrong.  So I ended up purchasing two downloads (any possibility for a refund for one download? doubt it).  I was no better off with the new download:  check register still ended a month back of the current date.  Our local technician worked with me by remote, and the problem was solved.  The program is good, and easy to work with once it's set up, but it is too difficult to update with a newer version for the person who has only a medium level of expertise with computer technology."
4,Good solid product to put on a new computer.<br /><br />I am sticking with it.
0,Hey Quickbooks if it's not broke don't fix it.  They took away too many of the features that made quickbooks what it is.  It almost looks like they are forcing the more advanced businesses into the enterprise solution. But I haven't seen the 2014 version of that yet who knows maybe the screwed that up too.
1,"As usual, Turbotax is quick and painless--especially if you've used it in the past and kept your tax files around.<br /><br />However, this year, they decided to charge you $20 extra to E-File your state taxes, despite this being the version that includes a &#34;free&#34; state license.  Next year, I'm going with a cheaper product."
0,"By deleting several schedules and other functionality, Turbotax crippled its 2014 software in a way that would force users to pay more (in the middle of doing taxes) to upgrade to a higher level. Be warned!"
2,"The version of the app I got here dated from some time in fall 2014 (as I recall), so when I opened it, it found a large update to download.<br /><br />The updater would quickly run through a few status messages and then display a &#34;Cleaning up installer HRBlock_6401_UPD.dmg&#34; message for 5+ minutes. It doesn't display any progress bar. I thought it had hung and kept trying to reinitiate the update process, even uninstalling, restarting Mac, and reinstalling the app. I followed the instructions at http://www.hrblock.com/support/software-support.html -- same result. On my last update attempt I left the app running while I called H&R Block customer support. After waiting on hold for 30 minutes without reaching a live agent, I hung up. Then I noticed the app had finished updating and opened its working tax return window. Now it seems to be working fine.<br /><br />So time to update (on my 2009-vintage Macbook Pro) is evidently greater than 5 minutes, but not greater than 30 minutes. I would have appreciated some warning that the update process can take a while."
3,"You won't go wrong with this will making kit.  I used it for my personal will as well as drafting a POA to perform a vehicle transaction.  In fact, I created my draft will that was part of my final project for my Wills, Trusts and Estate class and received an A from my teacher, who is an estate attorney.  Need I say more?"
2,"After completing my taxes using the 1040 form, I could not upload my forms to the IRS website.<br />I kept getting error messages for approximate 2 hours after multiple tries.  After 10-15 failed attempts to submit to IRS online,  I had to print out a hardcopy and snail mail LATE to the IRS...<br /><br />I also needed 1040-EZ forms, but this Deluxe package did not include the 1040-EZ forms.<br /><br />Ultimately, in a panic, I had to find the 1040-EZ forms online at the last minute, and again print out hardcopies and snail mail LATE to the IRS..."
2,"and have generally been pleased with it.  However, this time around when I was ready to file electronically I wasn't able to do it apparently because I was using a Macbook Pro to do my taxes and there were problems with e-filing for those of us using a Mac.  I'd paid for the e-file option and was pretty bummed.  Plus, I then had to make hard copies of everything in order to mail my returns in.  Not pleased at all about that.  Calling in to try to get my money refunded was no picnic either because it's always hard to get to customer support of Turbo Tax and extra hard late in the tax season.  I was finally able to get a refund but now I'm worried the same thing might happen again next year."
0,"Well.. tax season is over. But if 2015 is anything like this edition then steer clear.<br /><br />I read the awful reviews and bought anyway because I don't know of any better alternative. The software's good as ever, but the fees are insane. First I had to pay 100 bucks for home and business because I get paid with 1099's, then another $40 bucks for an extra state since I moved. THEN ANOTHER $25 to e-file that extra state. You've got to be friggin kidding me."
3,Key code was not recognized by Norton .  Norton tech support required to activate download.  Time loss and frustration attempting to download and activate.
4,Have been using Avast for years.  Simply the best.  It blocks harmful web sites but doesn't bog down my system.
2,"Good protection for free, but expect to be constantly nagged to upgrade to a paid version."
4,This is great. I can get all my music I bought over the years without taking up all my space.
2,"Had a problem with the product not updating.  I waited an hour or so.  When it happened on both my computers at the same time, I realized it was a problem on Norton's end, so I stressed less.  I updated an hour or so later, went through without any trouble.  I had another problem that was either a Norton problem or might or might not have actually been a virus infection.  I restored the factory image just to be safe.<br /><br />Summary:<br />When it works properly, which is most of the time: 5 stars<br />When it doesn't work properly: 0 stars"
3,"Happy with the anti virus.  The vault needs work, especially with Chrome browser"
1,I bought the whole thing.
1,With Norton installed and suppose to protect my computer.  I paid 119.00 to have virus and malware removed.
0,I was looking to purchase PS.  I wouldn't even mind paying a hefty upfront cost for great software but I will not get sucked in to this mess.
2,"When I scan the antivirus, either it mentions that everything is fine, when if I check right after with spybot it said I have some problems, or iit tells me it can not scan some files, but then it tells me to chose options to apply, but when I look for them so that I can chose them, I do not find them anywhere,"
2,Pros<br /><br />- Serves its purpose.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- It refuses to recognize H&R Tax files regardless of whether they are T11 or PDF files. So you are stuck with having to enter the data from scratch.<br /><br />- When filing the State form for Illinois it said I had to fill in a number in IL 1040 line 1a. That's all it said. No additional help and no indication what line 1a wanted.
1,I'm not impressed.  I'm going to try and re download it to our computer but only some of the icons work.  Big bummer!
0,"On May 1st I had to replace a perfectly working 2012 version due to Quicken killing it's bank interaction. The new version has several video issues, does not respond to &#60;ctrl&#62; commands (like &#60;ctrl&#62; D to delete), is noticeably slower in several scenarios and probably more issues that haven't surfaced yet. After 3 hours with online chat support, 1 1/2 hours with phone support, installing/uninstalling 3 times, installing Patch that was supposed to fix &#34;almost everything wrong&#34; with 2015 after each re-install I have accomplished absolutely nothing in the way of progress.  In addition I was promised to get a phone call two days ago from a tech supervisor who was &#34;checking on the problems&#34;. Nothing. And the wait times for chat and phone support are 45 min to an hour.  Suggestion: DO NOT BUY THE DOWNLOAD VERSION IF YOU EVEN SUSPECT YOU MAY NEED A REFUND. Get the disk and read the refund policy. That was my fault.  Unfortunately, I did not read all of the reviews prior to purchasing upgrade. On the other hand, what option is left? THANKS QUICKEN, for destroying a excellent (as of 2012) product."
3,This is a powerful graphics tool but unfortunately requires a huge learning curve.  There are a number of videos on youtube that can walk you through the steps but it takes a lot of work.<br />I believe it is well worth the effort as it can do most anything. I think it is a good investment if you want to do complex photo alterations and are willing to invest the time to learn how to work it.
0,The interface is antiquated and slow.  It is not particularly good at allowing you to input things not pulled from online.  I returned it and wonder how this program can be the leader in finance software.  An excel spreadsheet works much better than this.
3,The  free version works better than some of the paid antivirus programs I have tried. I think i will probably get the paid version.
3,"Excellent program.  Very helpful , as I need to print my own recipes , and also include nutritional information."
4,tried this software package after TurboTax tried to pull a fast one last year.  it worked well and was very easy.
4,"I'm so like with this product (free Avast Antivirus) because it offer an safe potential alternative for all kind people, and is better than other companies without price.  And is for all computers and devices like mobile smart phones too."
3,Great antivirus program has kept my computer virus free for years. Also free is always better. I haven't found a paid version that works better.
0,"Microsoft used to be one of my absolute favorite companies. The quality of the Office suite was exceptional, and customer service was great. I could not say enough good things about Office, Windows, and all things Microsoft.<br /><br />All of that changed a year ago, with the launch of the Office 365 hosted &#34;solution.&#34; I have had nothing but problems, delays when opening software, etc. ever since going to the hosted service.<br /><br />When I called for technical support, their tech completely WIPED ALL OUR BUSINESS CONTACTS from the system. This tech had gotten into the inner workings of our system, and the contacts were COMPLETELY gone. (Since then, we quit storing any contacts in Outlook.)<br /><br />The only thing that you can rely on now? That the software will be slow, buggy, and that the customer service will be of equal quality. The problems are significant enough that we are abandoning PCs altogether and going with Apple."
2,"I need Microsoft Office for my work teaching online.  Students are required to turn in their papers using Microsoft word or rich text formats, so I need it for grading.  My computer crashed, and came back from the puter doc with a new hard drive, so all programs were gone.  I didn't want to buy new at the local store, so off to Amazon, and got my product for much less, with delivery under a week.  Unbelievable service from wonderful Amazon.    Want to try downloading a free office suite that is offered on the web that promises full compatibility with Microsoft so that I don't have to keep paying the exhorbitant initial price for Microsoft products, and then find I'm tied in to upgrades and additions that are needed to keep the whole package going.  Even with the Amazon discounts, I feel Microsoft is way overpriced for the quality and designs that are offered."
1,We had the old crayola art that our grandchildren.  It got lost changing computers. This new version is not near as simple or interactive as the old version.  In fact it is downright hard to use.  I am sorry that I paid to download it.
2,"Deluxe used to include ability to report capital gains.  This year it doesn't.  So, here comes the issue.  The program asked me if I sold a home, to which I answered yes.  It then told me that I would have to upgrade Turbotax to the next version, however, because I lost money on the sale of the house, I did not need to report Capital Gains because there weren't any.  Thankfully, when I called Intuit, they refunded my money without an issue.  Just beware ahead of time before you purchase this product.  All of this could have been avoided if the software simply asked if you made money on the sale of your home."
4,excellent. i have had lots of attempts but no breaches. still virus and malware free.
2,I bought this product because the examples were pretty good and the price was great BUT owning this product now i think i should have just saved up for NIK because its not really that great. Good for beginners. Buying me NIK in a few weeks. I do not recommend.
4,"Great products, I would highly recommended for my family's and friends.<br />thank!"
0,"I was very unsatisfied with this purchase. The download wouldn't download right for my outlook. I then had to pay someone else, guru aid, to fix it, because your tech support sucks. I will never, ever use you again. My company, friends, and clients know about my experience with you."
2,Is norton
2,"I upgraded from Quicken 2001 (via. Quicken 2004 since Quicken 2015 doesn't read from Quicken 2001 files directly). It imported my data ok, for which am thankful, but had a number of bugs, mostly in the reports. Found workarounds in forums for many problems, but many problems reported for Quicken 2013 and not fixed yet. Quicken needs to cooperate with Windows 8.1 in determining font size."
0,Total garbage compared to ALL of it's competitors.
3,love it. very user friendly.prompts for all categories so you don't miss important deductions. i like the correction feature as well. let's me double check all deductions before i move to next category.
3,It is what it is.  Good to have MS Office on my Macbook.  Easy to download.  No problems.  All good.
4,Online code purchase. Very cool! Service improving very well!!
0,"I can't get this to work.  I never got a disk from Amazon, nor did I get any instructions.  I contacted Kaspersky; they said I should have gotten instructions with it.<br />Very unhappy"
3,"Easy, organized way to do taxes. Originally I was not willing to spend the extra for the outlandish increase in product line required to fulfill the same tasks as I did last year, however TT made good and gave a coupon to previous buyers.  I'll wait to see how bad the increase is next year before committing to buy again"
1,I have been a quicken user for 15 years or more and I find it is difficult to upgrade every time there are just to many changes and it would be easier if you would upgrade but let the people continue to be able to use the the version the way they are use to.  I got guick start and had to upgrade to deluxe I was using the mac version for 2 years and I bought a pc so that I could get and easier way to do my books.  I am having trouble getting a report using categories and the sub-totals of that field.
1,"Well, not too happy with the program this year. When I got to the end, ready to file, the program asked me to pay AGAIN. I purchased the program at Office Max (depot). Anyway, I didn't find this year program as easy to use in previous years. Will think about buying a different Tax Program next year.<br />PS: I don't think I should have to pay another $19.98 to file my State Return when I purchased the &#34;State Return&#34; with the Federal Delux program. Shouldn't indicate on the box you get a State return, but still have to pay e-file."
2,"Depending on the type and chapter of bankruptcy Turbo Tax may not be ideal to suit your needs.  From what I've gathered, bankruptcy under title 11 doesn't require one to report the forgiven debt as income.  Since I know little about the effects of bankruptcy I'm holding off using this software and taking my info to a professional.<br /><br />Once I entered that I claimed bankruptcy TurboTax states it cannot do it.  That doesn't give me alot of direction.  I just wish there was more information about this before I bought it.  Thought I'd warn people so they don't make the same mistake I did."
2,"Nothing wrong with this product, but I don't see any significant changes from the previous version.<br /><br />It would be nice if their mobile synch app would be offered to Windows Phones (7 and 8) too."
3,"I've been using Quicken since MS Money was discontinued, and by now, I've mostly gotten used to it. I probably don't need to upgrade every year, but I do anyway; for as long as I've been using it, there have been minor annoyances that I'm always hoping the next version will fix. And many of them do get fixed, too, but there always seems to be something that bugs me in each new version, hence 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />If you've never used Quicken, or have in the past but it's been a while, I'm sure there are detailed reviews out there that will help you decide if you need it (or need to upgrade). If you are currently using Quicken and have upgraded every year or so, the biggest deciding factors will probably be whether or not it fixes something that annoys you and whether or not you want Quicken Mobile. I wish I could help you further here, but I have not had a chance to try Quicken Mobile yet (although just having the option was a deciding factor for me), and I can't really put my finger on which annoyances of mine were fixed; I do, however, like working with it slightly better than with the 2013 version, so I know some things are different."
2,"The actual calculation of the return was fine.  However, it advertized as 1 Free State Return but I had to pay $24.99 to file the State.  That's not FREE"
4,easy to use and no hassles when updating or maintaining
0,Whats with this program.  All I want to do is capture frames in time. One every 3 or 4 seconds.  That's simple.  It does everything but that. I accidentally got it to work once then it would never work again. Too complicated. Isn't a capture program suppose to have a start and stop button on front page.  Too complex. Doesn't get to the point.
3,"I have been using Turbo Tax for 9 years and find it very easy to use and most thorough. I tried H&R Block but found that it did not pick up some deductions that Turbo Tax did. My one problem with Turbo Tax happened when I elected to file my state tax separately at a later date. It would start me with my federal taxes even though they had been e-filed. I would try to file my state tax but my federal tax would still come up first, Perhaps I didn't navigate properly, but it was most annoying. By accident, I hit upon the correct way to file the state tax. It should be easier to file taxes separately. Once federal is filed, it should go directly to the state."
0,"As many others have already mentioned, Turbo Tax Deluxe no longer supports schedule D.  If you have investment income, you need to buy Premier.  I have been using Deluxe for many years and bought it again without any doubt.  I should have read customer reviews before buying Deluxe.  I will return it and switch to H&R BLOCK DELUXE which still supports investment income.<br /><br />We should send the strongest message to Intuit for their betrayal to the royal customers."
4,Everything was fine!
0,"In order to force you into updating to a newer version, after a few years they will remove your ability to continue to download your bank information to quicken.  Because of this, I will never purchase this product again."
4,I've been using this product for years even when it was called Kiplinger Taxcut -- it works great everytime!  High 5 Star rating!!!
0,"WHAT THE HELL! IT CAN ONLY BE USED TO RECORD A SINGLE TRACK AT A TIME.  YOU CANNOT SAY, RECORD VOCALS OVER ANOTHER TRACK, ETC....  WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
3,Easy to use.  Good value
3,It requires me to pay for the State filing.
3,I have had a few hiccups with the product. But it was easy to figure out and is easy to use to keep track of my finances.
0,"Have you read the story in USA today?    [...]  The weasel worded \\""apology\\"" from the TT GM gave the usual \\""we're sorry that you screwed up\\"" answer.  Now here's the real truth if he had the courage to say it:    \\""You see, you people did not read the fine print well enough - you're so well, obtuse.  We thought we'd be able to force you fools that's been buying our TT Deluxe for 20 years to pay us another $30 or so for the same package you bought last year by forcing you to \\""upgrade\\"" (i.e. stay the same) to Premier.  That would have been $30 profit clear and free above since the cost to us was the same.  I thought I'd look like a profit guru and would collect millions in bonuses.  I thought we could slip this by you.\\""    Now, here's the rest of what he should have said in his \\""apology\\"":    \\"" I thought you'd lay down and buy it - I was a fool.  You people were not as gullible as I thought.  Now me and my company have egg on our face and have to spend millions in a campaign to get you to forgive us, just to get the money flowing back at the SAME LEVEL AS LAST YEAR.  So, I may have actually cost my company money but hopefully some of you sheeple will still just lay down the extra $$ and buy Premier anyway, so we will at least be at a wash and not lose all of my planned profits.  I'm hoping the board of trustees at my company see me eeking out a small extra profit - please some of you - just buy the Premier and don't ask for the rebate!    \\""Further, I'm begging you not to switch to any other tax software.  If our sales #s actually go down and TaxCut's go up, I'm toast.    \\""The next time we want to increase the price, we'll simply increase the price!  The board is already told us that NEXT YEAR, Deluxe is Deluxe!\\"""
2,"Computer software, what else is there to say?"
4,This is the best thing Quickbooks has introduced. I love the simplicity and ease of writing quotes and keeping track of orders. It's a no brainer to get things done this fast.
4,For me Norton is best and easiest to use.
0,They got caught this time and will try again!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"I upgraded to the 2014 version with R3 update. When I went to download transactions from Wells Fargo Bank via the Quicken software, I would get an error. Nothing would download. If I went into Wells Fargo's website and manually forced transactions to Quicken, it would work but that's not how Quicken is supposed to work.<br /><br />I contacted Quicken support and they said there wasn't enough customers with same issue so they don't have an answer for me.<br /><br />The only way for me to get Quicken to download transactions automatically was I had to upgrade connection from web connect to direct connect. When I did that, the transactions downloaded as they should have with no errors. The problem.....Wells Fargo will now charge me $3 per month for the direct connect service. I did not have this issue or fees with Quicken 2013. I should have never upgraded."
0,I have not been able to install this. Perhaps if a fresh install of windows 7 then perhaps. Not me.
2,"My biggest complaint is that e-file costs extra ($17.99).  Also, seemed to create an error in assigning last year's state refund as taxable in the calculations despite it deciding that last year's state refund was not a taxable income because of alternative minimum tax.    Contrary to what others have said it does do schedule C (at least basic sched C - profit/loss from business)."

1,"* see update below  -  one of the other reviewers said it best - The Service reps are hard to understand, so one has to wonder if they really even understand what you are saying to them? - I asked a rep about a feature we were looking for, and having QuickBooks Pro 2011, she assured me that the feature was available in QB Pro 2012 - and that I could upgrade for the special price she could authorize for me (it wasn't any special price - and when I told her I found a cheaper upgrade price on the QB website, she said I could have it for that price) - that should have been my first red flag - but did I pay attention? - NO - I upgraded - could not get the server to run, had to call QB support, and within 45 minutes, Support figured out the problem -  BUT - that's just the start -  since March 14, I have spent a total of 6 hours on the phone with support, was told I would get call backs, and, thankfully my life is not depending on this, because I am still waiting for the call backs!!! -  the last call back was supposed to happen Friday, April 23 between 1 - 3 PM, today is Monday April 23, 4:30PM, and I'M STILL WAITING!!!<br />UPDATE APRIL 24th 1:15 PM -  after sending out this review, and sending an email to intuit at an email address that was referenced in another reviewer's email, I actually got a response from QuickBooks, and while they still were not able to help me with the feature that I had initially asked about, they actually did ease the frustration a bit, which I found helpful - at last!"
0,"Unfortunately, it didn't handle my tax situation correctly, and I was very disappointed in its functionality when I imported brokerage data.  I gave it a shot, but it's back to TurboTax."
4,i like it because it works great!  I haven't had any viruses of any kind since I started using the Avast antivirus 2014.
4,"Free Download, and worth every cent!"
4,"5.0 Deluxe has been good to me so far, and I waited for the upgrade since Windows 8 came out.<br />VHS to DVD 7.0 doesn't have bells and whistles like other video editing software, but I don't care to use fancy software because it's time consuming to learn such software.<br />I've gotten used to the simple capture, edit, and burn/convert so I use the product with a new HD camcorder. I recommend the software upgrade to those who enjoyed the simple and easy of use with previous VHS to DVD products from Honestech."
1,"Terrible you cant even change the page wallpaper or color, I feel like I got ripped off."
1,"I'm a book editor, and I purchased this product for use on a new Dell, so I know the problem isn't my computer. I edit every day, Monday through Friday, using Microsoft Word, and I need accuracy and speed. This is what I do for a living. I can't tell you how many times I thought I had the file saved on the computer and the server only to later get an error message that the latest fixes were not saved to the cloud, so now I've lost two or three pages of edits. Then every once in a while, the page turns to gibberish. Text in all sorts of weird places. All I can do is save the document and hope the mess clears up. Or I can scroll down several pages, go back, and hope the document fixed the gibberish. Then sometimes the program is so slow, I type words and watch the letters start to appear on the page l-i-k-e-t-h-i-s. It drives me crazy. So I called tech support. Somebody tinkers with Word settings, and things seem to be quicker. An hour later Word is crawling again, and I'm t-y-p-i-n-g l-i-k-e t-h-i-s again. This program sometimes works great; other times it's exactly as I described it. Totally unreliable to perform as I need it.  If I had known I'd have these woes, I never would have subscribed."
3,Avast Security seems to be doing exactly what it claims to do to protect its Clients.I receive regular updates to keep the service current.
4,My favorite goto for ridding myself of malware.  Works nicely (for me) with Norton and is my trusted product for ridding Malware and love the extra care features it offers.  Not the most popular anti-malware (per CNET Downloads) but I am very happy with this product.<br /><br />It is a spyware and malware removal utility that detects and removes threats to your system in real time.<br /><br />Love that Amazon picked this product up!
1,"I installed this on mac 10.8.  I have only had this program a few days, and I haven't experienced the crashes that the other people have.  However, the program has not saved ANY of my progress from after the first time I played it with my user.  Every time I go back, all reports are erased and I cannot access the lessons I left off on.<br /><br />The second issue that started occurring mid-begginer level is that the game will stop recognizing the keyboard.  This is either 1) in the form of shifting the keyboard to one side, so it thinks 'j' is 'h'; 'h' is 'g'; 'g' is 'f' and so on. 2) It does not know any key at all - you can type every single key on the keyboard, including shifted characters, and it marks you wrong for al of them - even the correct answer.  When this happens, you literally have to press keys until you fail so bad that Mavis stops you and asks if you want to start over (you cannot exit out of the program with Command-q or escape, and there is no way to exit a game until it says so). Or 3) Mavis randomly says correct keys or wrong, and if you press the key some random number of times, it finally accepts it.<br /><br />I don't want to start all over again every time because this can't save, and you CANNOT learn on a typing game that get the keys wrong.  If these BUGS cannot be fixed, I will get my refund and I will recommend you NOT to buy it.<br /><br /> If the tech team responds to my support tickets with a useful solution, I will post it here for any other amazon users who have also had these bugs."
4,Have always depended on Quicken... love the program...
1,the product works great but would only down load on one computer repeated attempts to get Microsoft to fix problem has met with no response what so ever Bill Gates shame on you ! that's pretty lame
4,perfect!
0,No Macs
4,"I really like this antivirus, not only does it keep me up dated, but it is free also. So thank you for this antivirus."
3,"IT seems that everyone uses Lightroom these days.  If I were a professional, I would probably see LR as a must.  I have used it fairly often and with pretty good success.  I'm sure the automation used to sort through thousands of photos and apply presets to those is a requirement.  It is fairly easy to use at an entry level and it helps turn out great looking photos.    On a negative side, I have had a few instances where the software seems to hang up on my Mac and I have to restart it to get it to perform some tasks."
4,"I love the 2015 version of Quick Books! I am a self taught user, so this has been a learning process since 2008. The look of this version is so crisp & clean. Ease of navigation is great. This may be a small thing to some people, but I am so happy to be able to print individual envelopes! No more switching to MS Office & back to QB! I am even doing my own payroll now! Thank you for listening."
1,Very invasive compared to last year's program.  I am disappointed!
2,"Very well organizer and easily imported all data from last years TuboTax return Would love to give it a 5 but unfortunately H&R Tax software cannot import data from my financial service company. Bummer, I had to switch back to TurboTax but over all this seems like a great product otherwise."
2,"Standard bloated stuff from Microsoft. I wish there was a universal alternative. Excel is great, even if it is unintuitive in its interface. Outlook is so-so, clunky and misbehaves. Word is as unintuitive as ever, and glitchy to work with. Don't get me started on Power Point, the great bane of meetings and presentations everywhere. Awkward to create with, and tedious to view. Like I said, I wish there was an alternative. Until then, I'll use this and try not to grind my teeth."
3,"Well, I finally upgraded from Quicken 2000.  I got 14 years out of the last software purchase.  The new one is taking a bit to get used to, but definately does a good job of keeping track of finances.  I like the ability to upload transactions from my bank and credit cards."
4,Been using it for years. I like it transporting from the previous year.
4,"Works as advertised, and doesn't seem to burden the machine. Until someone else comes up with a better product, Norton will remain our go-to program."
3,"I've used Norton for years. It has always worked well for me. I will probably never use all 10 licenses but it's nice to know I have them. When the subscription runs out, they shut down that same day, unlike years ago. That's why I only gave them 5 stars."
1,"So far, I'm not very happy with Quicken 2014. I have used Quicken for years and this was an upgrade for me (necessary to continue online banking). The program runs slowly and has closed unexpectedly a few times."
2,"If you do not mine the sells pitch showing up on your screen asking to upgrade or buy their other products it is okay, otherwise pay and buy Norton 360 which does a lot of other things and faster too."
1,"I was dismayed by the problems I had using the Deluxe version this year!!  I had to upgrade online when I started to use it and then even had to pay $30 additionally; $25 was refunded after so many of us complained of a 'bait-and-switch' scheme this year.  When I resumed using it, I had entry problems, so bad that I had to contact Intuit directly for help.  A rep there ended up GIVING me the Premier version which was difficult to download; repeatedly tried to get it installed and finally was successful.  When I went to use the state forms, they were locked up even though I was supposed to have free access to one state for filing.  Had to contact Intuit AGAIN for help and it was eventually resolved; then had to pay $19.99 to file electronically the state copy.  I seriously doubt that I will ever use TurboTax again after many years of usage.  They seem to have lost their way!!"
0,"This is a Rip Off!  DO NOT PURCHASE!  Does NOT include STATE!  I have always purchased the &#34;Deluxe' version for Turbo Tax in past tax years.  For the first time I've made my purchase directly with Intuit's website as a download versus purchasing from a Store...I did not see the small comment that &#34;this Deluxe&#34; version did not include the Free State.  The small comment of a disclaimer aside....my &#34;Deluxe&#34; version purchase price was $37 while the &#34;Deluxe Version with the state is $49...Ok I'll pay the $12 difference right?...NO!  Intuit is charging me $39.99 for the State!  Also Intuit has NOT included several schedules in my &#34;Deluxe&#34; Version.  I have trusted and recommended Turbo Tax since its release years ago, so in that confidence I took a chance to download their product directly from the company's website.  You have cheated and lost your best customer for what...$28?!  I have read a comment recommendation for H&R Block's software for $30 that can transfer Turbo Tax files into their software....here I come! Good bye from a long time customer."
1,"I &#34;upgraded&#34; my original security to this package. Never have had soo many issues with the way my computer runs now. I have an insane amount of pop-ups occurring every time I click on something. And this happens on just basic sites, even Amazon! this program went thru my system and said that there is nothing wrong...but clearly there is. My laptop has never run this way, and I don't know if it has to do with the method in which I purchased this program or what, but I do a lot of online, well everything, and never had problems like this before."
2,"I purchased this for my new business, and at first it was like looking at astrophysics. but after some help from my accountant and a little practice, I was able to perform basic activity related to my business transactions. I know it will pay off when tax season come around as it will be a couple of clicks away from doing my taxes since it keeps track of all my business financials and more. The only thing I had a problem with was the ridiculously expensive price for an old version.  The new version was cheaper at Office Depot. I had to buy this one because my accountant used it and recommended I use the same version so we can stay compatible."
1,"I recently upgraded from Quickbooks SimpleStart to Quickbooks Online. I have used the SimpleStart for some years and was happy with it. Unfortunately, after upgrading to the Online version, once tax time came I found to my dismay that I could no longer transfer my business records to TurboTax, so will have to manually transfer or buy a desktop version. Since all are owned by the same company, and all are aimed at businesses, I find this very odd, and thought I ought to warn purchasers of the online products.<br /><br />To their credit, the phone support folks at Quicken have been very helpful, in researching possible fixes, and acknowledge that the lack of compatibility seems a bit odd.<br /><br />Anyway, be forewarned! I like the online product, but due to the lack of year-end compatibility with TurboTax, I am forced to rate it a 2."
2,Still don't know how to use it
1,They goof this thing up every time they have a new release.  They make you buy it every 3 years under the guise that they can't support the old download format.  This is complete poppycock.  I work for a bank.  We haven't changed our Direct Connect in 10 years.<br /><br />No new useful features.  Just more bloat and cost.  Unfortunately I'm stuck with them due to the enormous history in my database.
4,"Smooth, easy, very thorough.  Purchasing, downloading and use were so easy we had no reason to contact Turbo Tax customer service."
3,"I install but inmediatly blocked my administrative software, I before use to the norton internet security and didnt have any problem, but now every day I have to autorize my administrative software in the norton´s settings."
1,"Well, I used this last year after many years of using turbo tax. I wanted to try something different. I muddled through in 2009 and tried again in 2010. State support is very weak, often telling me to use the form. I gave up after a few times and went back to turbo tax."
2,"It is fun to listen to Homer Simpson's voice as your guide, but since this is a recorded voice and not computer generated, it does not include street names, i.e., it is \\""turn right\\"" rather than \\""turn right on Elm Street\\"".  I prefer to hear the street names, so I have switched back to the built-in computer voice."
3,Been a Quicken user for ~20 years.  Leaned long ago that the annual sequence of updates was not necessary - really just a way for Intuit to generate more $$$ from loyal users.  Had resolved to minimal updates (just prior to my latest version going into unsupported mode).  Was drawn to try Quicken 2013 for the (seemingly long overdue) mobile app.  After 6 weeks usage - I'm impressed:  The link to the Quicken Cloud and to my Android devices (3) works well.  The linked approach seems to beg for an ongoing service with progressive updating.  Would seriously consider adopting a subscription model (either $2-3/month or ~$30-35/annually).
3,"I was pleased with the ease of H&R Block At Home 2010 this year. However, I had some complications come up that I wasn't able to solve in the program. I had a special issue that I wanted to approach differently, but I couldn't alter the form to make the changes I wanted to make. I also had some supporting documents that I wanted to include so that I could file my return online, but I was unable to do this. My sibling, with the same issue, had an accountant do his return and the accountant's software was able to allow him to make the non-default entries on the special form and to include a letter of explanation in my brother's return and still file it online. I won't have this issue again in the future, I hope, but the additional flexiblity would be nice. I suppose, though, that it would void any sort of warranties that come with the software."
3,"I use Quicken for personal finances and QuickBooks for business.  Some changes they have made make it tricky to do certain tasks because you can't do them the same way as before. I'm hoping I will get more comfortable with it, the longer I use it."
4,"Great product. Most people don't trust free downloads, but avast is something that you can put your faith in!"
0,This is crap if i could rate it 0 stars i would  this dose not work well with minecratf so if your useing it for minecratf do not waste your money on this crap
4,"As an intermediate computer user, I have found no other Free antivirus software that has such comprehensive coverage as Avast! Antivirus. For family and friends whose computers I have been asked to look at, I always recommend and install Avast! for them; and demonstrate how easy it is to scan and remove malware, and virus laiden operating systems. I also have Avast! on my Android cellphone. Both my cellphone and my computer are automatically updated for seamless near transparent operation except for the notifications Avast! generates to make aware that I am protected. Get your Avast! Free Antivirus Software from a trusted source like Amazon. You too can have the last laugh on spammers, scammers, and hackers."
1,I purchased this to improve on network connection going from Windows 8.1 to 8.1 Pro which is what the Pro was suppose to correct. I am still having some issues. I'm not sure if I would have had better luck with installing a full version or not.
0,I've worked with pc tax software for as long as it has been available and this version was the absolute worst.  Did anyone at H&R Block do any thorough testing before release?  Before updates?  Next year I will definitely be looking for a new vendor...
2,Errors in data transfer. I found this to be strange. Clearing them up took a while. Older versions seemed to transfer more cleanly.
4,I like it.*
0,"This product went downhill from the start. The download uses an application called &#34;7-Zip&#34; to download the product and it includes a bunch of extra items including a &#34;tool-bar&#34; that you cannot refuse to download. At that point I canceled the download and called Amazon for tech support, Amazon referred me to Microsoft  and the issue  degenerated into Microsoft referring me back to Amazon and both refusing to refund me for the defective product. I do not hold this against Amazon but I do find Microsoft the responsible party and refusing to refund my 100 bucks paid to them."
3,"I was put off by the changes TurboTax made to their product offerings this year. It created a good deal of confusion. However, once I sat down to prepare my taxes, I was able to navigate through the program easily. It's still a good product. My one complaint: the amounts charged for e-filing (after the one free federal return) seem very high to me. Just another profit source for Intuit, I suppose."
0,"Have used TT Basic since 1999, read back of package says all forms included, so purchased Basic again; just this year find schedule C&D are blocked; have to now buy Premium for an additional $80; which is crazy; if they get me this year, will switch to H&R Block next year; why would Turbo Tax due this to loyal customers; except for greed"
3,"The user interface is not intuitive but not unbearable.  Developers need to take a look at other products.  The automated features are great for amateurs like me. But, I was honestly hoping for a little better quality image correction and effects."
2,"QUICKEN came up with a newer version of their program and didn't bother to inform buyers that the new version would not work on older  computers - like mine.  &#34;You can keep your old computer if you like it - but if you buy our new QUICKEN, you have to buy a new computer to run the new up dated version.&#34;  (ahem)  Anyway,  Amazon refunded the cost to me.  Thank you, Thank you."
0,"I thought this was a great product, until I got to the State part. It does not support Part Year Residence Return for Delaware,  after calling support I found there are several states they do support. Use caution if you are buying this and research if your State you need is Supported, I could find no where that it told you that info."
1,"I bought this to upgrade from Quicken 2011. I started with problems with their own update and after some time talking to customer service and installing the update to the update the program started opening. I'm not sure how this version is suppose to be an update, it is way slower then Quicken 2011. I'm talking annoyingly slow and painful to switch views in itself. There are also times I click to start the program and I'm not sure if started or not because it takes so long to start up."
2,"I didn't want to pay for my annual subscription of $59, so I purchased this download.  It's okay.  I''m getting spam that I didn't get with the higher-priced version."
2,"Photoshop Elements is fine.  However, when you have issues, Adobe customer service is terrible.  The customer service agant made things worse, not better, and recommended actions that could compromise my computer's security."
2,"When the early 20th century writer Andre Gide was asked who was the greatest French poet, he replied &#34;Victor Hugo—alas!&#34; Which sums up my feelings about Quicken 2014. Frustrated by its unwieldiness, its interface challenges, its pokiness, and the occasional hair-tearing bug, I've looked hard for a superior program that handles all my needs, and come up empty. To be sure, I haven't experienced the same problems upgrading from earlier versions as others have reported. And Quicken support, if you are patient enough to jump through the many hoops and roadblocks and succeed in talking to a real person, is helpful—they sent me a free copy of Quicken 2011 when they couldn't solve my problem with Quicken 2009. But I wish I could find another program that can forecast my checking account balance and track all my investments. If it had a mobile app that was helpful and easy to use, that would be a big plus; Quicken (despite its promises) does not.<br /><br />Quicken does about 85% of the things it promises very well, and that's enough to keep me going with it. When I upgraded from Quicken 2011 to Quicken 2014, at full price, I was pretty shocked that virtually nothing had changed, aside from the introduction of the unhelpful mobile app (it forces me to enter my name and password too often, making it cumbersome to use, its main screen shows me numbers that have no relevance to my situation, it takes to many clicks to enter a transaction, and its interface is not customizable). I have had serious problems with the program for over five years that show no signs of resolution—for example, it continually prompts me to enter the cost basis of stocks and funds bought gradually over a period of years many years ago, a figure I have no way of obtaining, and if I set my primary credit card to automatically download and reconcile new transactions, it enters a large &#34;balance adjustment&#34; not once, but again and again, although every transaction has been confirmed since the card was opened.<br /><br />The bottom line: If you have more than a few accounts, need to accurately forecast the balance of your primary cash or checking account, and want to automatically download and synchronize with your accounts at major banks and investment companies, Quicken is your only real choice. Alas!ce the card was opened.<br /><br />The bottom line: If you have more than a few accounts, need to accurately forecast the balance of your primary cash or checking account, and want to automatically download and synchronize with your accounts at major banks and investment companies, Quicken is your only real choice. Alas!"
2,ok
4,"Great value, best internet security available IMHO."
3,The program works fine.  I've been using for several years on multiple laptops and have not had any virus issues.  It is not the resource hog that it was several years ago and work smoothly in the background.
1,"My QB file is 75MB and 2015 is very slow even on an SSD drive.  I was running the same file on QB 2012 without any issue, but 2015 is just slow to load different features even once the file is open.  I wish I could go back to 2012 but I use payroll which requires a version that is greater than 2012, other then being slow, uglier and costing me several hundred bucks, I see zero difference in functionality."
3,"I am a frequent user of H&R Block Tax software and have used this solution for my taxes for the past several years.  It continues to be a solid, capable product that delivers on making tax filing easier.  H&R Block has done a good job of integrating state tax preparation and filing along with keeping up with the ever increasing complexity of the Federal tax system and filing process. It would be good if H&R Block would offer free State filing as well and this would make the software a 5-star product!"
4,Its simple and easy to use.  I highly recommend it.
4,AWESOME SOFTWARE!
3,Software works exactly as advertised and the download worked as well
0,Poor.  We sent this program back because it was so user unfriendly. We are doing property management on a spreadsheet.  Don't waste your money on this loser.
2,"Another 3 year required update if I wanted to continue downloading transactions, which of course I do.  I have been using Quicken since 2005, maybe earlier, but don't recall.<br /><br />I'm ok having to buy the latest version every 3 years, because tech is always changing and they need to stay in business.  But Im never impressed with the newer version.  They like to add more features, but sometimes less is more.  I would love to see a slimmed down version to just do basic balancing.  I will hopefully take the time to research alternatives before getting the next version.<br /><br />The latest is noticeably slower than the 2011 version, and its not my computer.  They want to push their cloud services, but no thank you, I do not want my financial information on the cloud no matter how secure anyone says it is.<br /><br />Bottom line: More unnecessary features and slower. Will be similar to prior versions, so get it if you like or try an alternative this year."
3,I am sure my taxes will be easier to do next year. I was a fan many years ago but had to find other programs when Quicken gave up on the Mac. Now Quicken is back and as good as it gets. Sorry to see some of the style stripped away but it is easy to use and set up was simple. The one upgrade I would like to see is the ability to make the font bigger. Why so small? I can hardly read the report.
1,"Quicken 2014 is nowhere near as good as any previous version I've used, going back to 2001.  Cannot budget income other than paychecks.  Will not retain budgets previously posted.  Does not produce charts and graphs that I have come to rely upon.  Etc., Etc."
0,"I made the mistake of buying this before reading about it on the Internet, otherwise I would have known that Intuit had moved  Schedule D to the Premier package. Keep in mind, for the last couple decades Sched D was included as part of the Deluxe package, but no more.  While reeling from this news after purchasing I found an article that said H&R Block was jumping on this as an opportunity and was offering their software for free to anyone that could prove they had bought any version of TurboTax 2014.  I sent the email and receipt off to them and three days later got an email reply with a download activation key. In light of offerings from H&R and TaxAct I just don't see the Premier version of TT being of any value at that price."
3,"I bought Quicken 2015 when I could no longer update my accounts online with Quicken 2012. I give it four stars because Quicken forced the change and because I may yet run across a problem. Otherwise, Quicken Deluxe 2015 is smarter, slicker, and more intuitive. It's comfortable for longtime customers (like me) and easier to  use. It's the least Intuit can do when it prevents the previous version from working."
0,"I too had to upgrade to Premier. After reading the &#34;Responses from the Seller&#34; indicating that the issue with missing forms and schedules was being addressed with a free upgrade, I went ahead and purchased the Deluxe Package.  Apparently it doesn't apply to those of us who chose to use the online platform last year.  Thinking it would be more convenient to just keep files in the cloud, so I wouldn't have to worry about changing computers or crashed drives, I made the switch last year after over two decades of buying the disks.  Now it's costing me an additional $30 (plus tax) because I made the switch.<br /><br />Next year I'll bite the bullet and take the time to learn a different tax prep program.  Even if it's not as polished as TTax, at least I'll feel better spending my money with a company that's more transparent with their pricing and capabilities."
2,"So, I rated the software as &#34;It's ok&#34; because it looks exactly the same as my 2014 version. I buy the upgrades hoping there would be a marked improvement in the user interface. It's still the same interface as 10 years ago. I mean seriously, I know the product is a cash cow for the company but you would think they would try to merge their mint.com product and user experience while differentiating the products even though they are complementary. Why is there a quicken cloud sync and it doesn't sync to mint.com?<br />It's one thing to keep the products separate so that consumers aren't confused but it's another thing to have no product strategy that adds value for the consumer. So, what, it will be expensive to overhaul the product? I'm not going to buy another version of quicken ever again until Intuit does something to provide more value and a better user experience."
0,"This review is being written 4/13/2014 for the Norton Internet Security 2014 - 1 User / 3 Licenses [Download], advertised and sold by Amazon on their website.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I've seen several instances of virus-infected computers that were protected using this product.  The single most important aspect of this software suite to me is to prevent a computer from becoming infected with a virus - hence the failing grade.<br /><br />The users of computers infected are adults, and I'm often called in to assist with various general computer setup and usage due to my expertise in this field.  I'd characterize these users as average, and the applications they use include banking, music entertainment, social networking, voice/video over IP communications, and some games.  The vector for infection is in the downloading, particularly of games.  Norton has failed to detect these viruses.<br /><br />In contrast, I'm also performing the same consultant role with a half dozen people using [[ASIN:B00E6OPDUS McAfee Total Protection 3PC 2014]] and none of them have infected computers.  The profile for this set of users include teenage children all the way up to senior citizens.<br /><br />Based on my experience with the two sets of users, I don't recommend the Norton product."
2,I was a bit bummed that I didn't get to file my state taxes for free with this purchase. Every other year I have bought it from the store I have gotten one free state filing with the purchase.
3,"No one likes to do taxes, software makes it a little easier.  Have always used HR block and have had great success."
1,"I have used quicken for the past 12 years. The product lately is getting worst with every new version. I was forced to upgrade to version 2011 (older versions are not being supported any more and actually stop downloading transactions) and it works so slow that it is berely usefable, some times not usable at all. I spend 4 times more time now just downloading my transactions online then I did before. I would gladly downgrade to older version if I could."
3,In my opinion it has been  improved from last year.
2,I found the HR Block software easy to use and very understandable for preparing a trust tax return. The only negative is I could not make the e-file function properly and had to print and mail the tax return.
3,"Stops malicious software, keeps my PC protected, but too many notifications. You can dig into the settings and cut off most of the notifications, but for the average user who just wants something that will work without much tweaking, it may get annoying."
0,"Terrible product - Installed software and upon opening it would not let me proceed without updating. Tried to update but continually received error message &#34;Update Error! An error has occurred while extracting the archive. Please try again later.&#34; I googled this error message and tried all recommendations without luck. After two wasted hours I gave up, downloaded H&R Block software and filed taxes without issue. H&R software was able to import my old Turbotax return without issue. BTW, I have used Turbotax for several years, and found H&R Block easier to use. I am running MAC OS X 10.9.5 so if you are running something similar I recommend avoiding Turbotax."
1,"This year Turbo-Tax removed the investment category from deluxe to premier without letting long time buyers know. However, I did receive an email from them saying they will give me a $25 refund after i file my taxes and show that i used Turbo-Tax for 2013. This helps but should have been advised before I purchased the Deluxe version."
3,Not as good as the WIndows product.
0,This awful product takes over your toolbar and inserts its own search engine and homepage. I have spent hours trying to get rid of it. The instructions on AVG's website for getting rid of it don't work. I wish I had never installed AVG.
1,It doesn't keep the timing in Power Point.  Slides soon are ahead of the sound.  Worthless.
4,COOL
0,This version of quicken completely broke the old budget functionality. I have abandoned use of the budget because of bugs and incompatible changes. I can no longer depend on the budget. See [...] before you upgrade!
1,"I'm a long time user of Quicken - maybe more than 15 years.  I recently 'upgraded' to V2012.  What a mistake.  Most of the program is the same as 2011 except for the budgeting module.  The budgeting module has many problems that are causing us longtime users many hours on the line with Quicken and leaving us with a whole list or workarounds to make it useful.  You have to take a leap of faith but doing things like entering a budget in the filed for January 2013 actually shows up in January 2012 in the budget report.  This is necessary since you have no access to prior periods.  If you install V2012 today your budget creation screen will show the periods February 2012 through January 2013.  Try as you might, the program will not give you the option of setting up the budget for January 2012 through December 2012.  Also, at one point the budget program did not allow for the entry of negative numbers for such things as paycheck deductions for taxes and the like.  They fixed this with the latest update, but now all expenses have to be entered with a negative sign.  Oh, by the way, the display does not show the negative sign once it's entered.  Doesn't matter if you enter negative or positive the display shows everything as positive.  If you can stand for illogical work-arounds this program is for you."
3,"As usual TurboTax does a fast and easy job of cruising through tax returns and e-filing them, EXCEPT in my case, this year, in addition to the federal return, I was doing two state returns because for the last couple of years I have been splitting my time between the two, and the tax calculation for one of them gets very complex under these circumstances.  TurboTax handled it ALMOST perfectly. The calculations were apparently done correctly, but the information displayed in the income allocation screen of the  step-by-step user-interface was wrong (a &#34;minor&#34; software error that TurboTax support would not acknowledge), causing me to enter incorrect data in some worksheets, which then created errors in the return. After long periods on hold and long phone calls sorting out the discrepancy, all three returns were successfully e-filed, and I could finally put it all behind me close to midnight on April 15."
1,...the state portion of th software doesn't recognize the property ID required for the county we live in.<br />The customer service team said I would need to file via paper...
2,I have used these products for years and have worked with many businesses helping them with the products. Some one needs to make some big changes to make it work better.
4,Did what it said it would do.  Easy to use.
0,"No hacker, virus, trojan horse, malware, spyware or bot could have messed up my computer as completely as the APE12 download.<br /><br />Every setting on my computer was changed.  Almost everything on my desktop--except, of course, for the Adobe icons--was removed.  A different browser toolbar was installed (I did NOT opt into this).  All views for files, control panel, folders--EVERYHING was changed.  Even the background screen was changed.  I had to do a system restore to get everything back to normal--and even then I kept finding little surprises like the Adobe \\""Terms and Conditions\\"" installed on my Kindle for PC!  The NSA could hardly be more intrusive and controlling.  The first thing I did after regaining a measure of control was to uninstall this horrible travesty of a program.<br /><br />I don't care if APE12 can turn lead into gold or extract elixir from raw sewage.  There is no excuse and no justification for trashing someone's personal computer in this way and planting data where it doesn't belong.  Stay away from this download.  (And please, no \\""you shouldn't evaluate it if you didn't use it.\\""  How could I use it when I couldn't even find my video files?)<br /><br />NOTE: I currently use both PSE and CS4 for my photo processing.  When I bought these--on disk--I had no such problem.  And when I tried out PSE9 a couple of years back (same computer, same OS) I had no such problem.  I will be avoiding not only APE12 but all Adobe download and \\""cloud\\"" products in the future."
1,This worked great until a certain point and then stopped working due to software issues. It did help me learn to type to a certain point.
4,Instructions were very clear.
2,"It was not as easy to use as in the past and had more glitches. I started using Turbo Tax 9 years ago when my husband became ill and the tax filing duty fell upon me for the first time in many years.  I quickly became a great fan of this program, but I felt disappointed with this year's version.  Not as easy to use and more difficult to install correctly.  Hopefully they will get their act together and next year they will go back to what they were previously doing, which was much better than this year's formatting.  I will try again next year, and hopefully all will go well again."
4,Always works
4,Best product and easy to use!
2,Didn't want to upload at first stated needed Windows XP. After playing with it was able to upload to computer. The product itself is EXCELLENT though and well worth the money.
2,I needed something that worked for apartments and could provide drawings of elevations.  This was the wrong choice.  It is great for doll house views of houses.
2,Couldn't figure out why my laptop was so slow until my cousin ( a computer geek) told me it was my Norton which is not really designed for laptops. Wish Norton would've made this clearer
1,"I bought this to copy and edit old VHS video tapes so I could keep them on DVD.  However, I could never get the settings set so that the resulting DVD movie wasn't jerky.  The quality of the resulting DVD was bad enough that I threw them away, even with tapes that weren't bad to begin with.  I don't know where the problem was.<br /><br />So I bought a Magnavox VHS to DVD unit on Amazon which works pretty well, and use this software as a monitor with my computer.  This way I didn't need to have it attached to a TV to copy tapes -- I just opened the software to 'advanced' and then use the remote with the Magnavox to control having that unit copy tapes.<br /><br />So i'm glad I put this software and connection box (I bought the deluxe version with a connection box that I could wire the VHS system to my computer USB port) to good use, even if it's not what it was intended for.<br /><br />FYI: I used this with a Windows 7 system with 6 GB memory and via a USB 2 port  I didn't try it with USB 3."
4,"Never any problems if anything tried to attach my computor while on line Avasts internet Security stopped it dead in it's tracks, blocking attack web sites or pages that were hacked. The safety zone is great for anything the needs extra security.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Avast user"
2,"1 star down because, this is a bit weaker than my expectation.  TRY BEFORE YOU BUY.  These days, you can download software for free and try it out before buying it during the demo period.  I'm not sure if this was a smart choice; but on a Lightning Sale, it was worth it to me.  If you want something more powerful, there are other options.  If you are serious about Video Editing, you'll want something that incorporates better sound editing, and other things related to production, such as Sony's, etc, offering here on Amazon.<br /><br />I'm taking 1 more star down because Amazon's download system was extremely poor and slow.  I consider this to be part of the product, because installation and download took almost half a day.  Because the download took so long, I couldn't install my new harddrive or my USB 3.0 pci-e card I bought, because I was afraid I might have to start over the download.  It used up all my time!!  Very slow downloading, Amazon!  Snails pace and torture. I have extremely fast internet, and that was a terrible experience.  Any company that sells software on Amazon should have the customer download it from their own site -- not from Amazon's servers.  Amazon should just provide the link & the activation code.  Corel -- please figure out why it was so slow and give us a work around.  I would have just downloaded it elsewhere, except I was afraid that only the Amazon download would work for activation.  Amazon needs to be clearer about this and give us a choice of downloading from faster servers.<br /><br />Until Amazon improves its download speeds, I'm buying boxed software only."
2,I've used Turbo tax for years.  My only reason for not giving this a 4 star review is that Turbo tax has started to phase out a number of features that I appreciated - they are now only part of the upgrade - and because they keep trying to sell me &#34;Tax return loans.&#34;
0,"I've been very happy with AVG Internet Security, so I downloaded the trial version of this and it messed up Thunderbird. If I try to click on links in emails my cursor starts blinking wildly, won't work, and I have to restart. I uninstalled and reverted my system to a restore point before the installation. I tried reinstalling Tbird and Firefox, no use. I ran a virus scan, came up clean. Nothing fixed the problem, and AVG said they couldn't help.    I was foolish to install this software in the first place since I already had CCleaner which does exactly the same things. Beware."
0,"I would not recommend this at all.  After downloading, the installation was mystifying and took an hour or more to figure out.  Now that it's installed, my computer acts as if it actually is infected--super slow.  If I could find Norton on a disk I would buy it.  Twenty dollars down the drain for this horrible product."
4,"I'm so glad to 'take back my taxes' thanks to this software.  As a self employed person, i couldn't handle the numerous forms and complexities of my return, so I had to pay a tax preparer each year.  But the interview format of this software made it doable, so now I can prepare my own - and save the money I'd pay a prof'l.  Very empowering feeling!  Gaining a better understanding of the particulars of each form, how the numbers all relate to each other, form to form---what affects what, etc-- was a great side benefit.  The icing on the cake:  i discovered an error one of my prof'l preparers made four years ago, resulting in potential tax benefit.  This would never have been discovered had I not been doing my own taxes with this software."
0,"I have been a Quicken user on PC for over 15 years. I love my Apple portable products so much that I bought a IMac which is also awesome. I want to ditch my PC but this product for Mac is so pathetic I am stuck keeping a PC. I don't want to run Windows on my Mac so I literally threw this software away. If you've used Quicken for windows, DO NOT waste your money on this Mac version like I did.  If I could rate 0 stars I would!"
0,"I upgraded from Quicken 2012, since Intuit is going to intentionally obsolete 2012 in a couple of months.  2015 installs, but has a mandatory registration process.  I went through the registration, but got stuck in an infinite loop every time I tried to complete the registration.  I tried resetting the password, creating a new account, and everything else I could think of, to no avail.  Finally I wasted a couple of hours with Intuit chat support repeating the same failed efforts.  Intuit has no phone support, and their chat support people are completely clueless.  Also, they are some of the slowest typists I've ever seen.<br /><br />If you have Quicken 2012, I suggest you ride it out to the end, then find a different solution.  Because this is a software download, I can't even request a refund."
3,Easy to download. Excellent price and a very good product.  Installed on my Mom's new computer and so far so good....
1,"If there was an alternative to learning Vietnamese I would probably use it, but currently there is not. I'm anxiously awaiting DuoLingo's Vietnamese for English Speakers course.  Cons: - You are responsible for deactivating the software for any computer where you install it. If your computer dies or the data is corrupted before you deactivate the software, too bad, you just lost a license. See their official policy here: http://support.rosettastone.com/en/language-learning/articles/How-to-deactivate-my-Rosetta-Stone-program (IMHO this is completely unacceptable for such an expensive app. They need to do server side tracking of active installations.) - Their support takes forever to respond. Last time I e-mailed them about an installation problem it took 3 days to get a human response. - At some point my progress was lost, even though my progress was allegedly being sync'd up to TOTALe.  All of the words I was having trouble with, and all the other stats they use for tailoring the reviews and stuff, are gone and I essentially need to re-train the app to my skill level, which is nearly starting over. - Version 5.0 has a minimum height of 790 pixels (in OS X), which is taller than the screen resolution of the 11&#34; Macbook air. Because of this the bottom of the window is cut off.  Pros: - Their support is usually pretty accommodating and nice. - This app can be used offline, so yay for all the situations where that is useful. - Version 5.0 was a free upgrade from 4.0."
3,Works just find.
3,It's Quickbooks...what can I say.  If you're an accountant you probably won't like it much but for the rest of us mere mortals it works pretty well and you don't have to be an accounting major to use it.  Best to have your accountant set the accounts up before use.
1,Just having trouble figuring it out.
4,I have used this product for years on two laptops and a desktop in my home. It has been exceptionally reliable in all of its functions.
1,"This software is just OK.  It not great like the windows version, but it is better than iBank.  Some things that I really do not like include: needing a calculator to balance my checking account to my mid-month bank balance (if you sort by cleared status the balance does not follow), This version seems to be, primarily, set up for downloading transactions from your banks website.  Reports are very limited.  If you like to customize how Quicken looks, forget about it.  And get used to hitting command/n every time you want to enter a new transaction.  When you try to reconcile an account some transactions mysteriously don't show up. Usually closing the reconcile and reopening it solves the problem.  Overall it is a fine program, not great but not horrible.  Once you get used the weirdness it passes for an accounting program.  My biggest disappointment comes from being wowed by the windows versions that I have used, and being impressed by what they can do.  With the Mac version I find myself getting frustrated and saying I know Intuit can build an intuitive program that works, I've seen it and it's in their name!"
4,Works just great - easy to use - error free - got my refund back in a week - Will use again and again
3,Good
1,"There are a lot of things to like about Quicken 2014, but a few glaring issues make the reports and information presented useless. If the balances on my accounts would correctly update, I would give is 5 stars.<br /><br />Problems:<br /><br />- Information from Wells Fargo Mortgage is downloaded but Quicken (2013 & 2014) report the balance incorrectly. Quicken reports the balance as the initial loan amount. This throws off any reporting on this asset and the total net worth which is displayed prominently on the opening screen of Quicken.<br /><br />- I have an auto loan through Chase which as the SAME ISSUE as the Wells Fargo mortgage above.<br /><br />These issues are BOTH in version 2013 and have carried over to 2014. Wells Fargo is one of the largest mortgage service providers, and I would expect the online service linking to work properly. Additionally, this is an ongoing issue that Intuit seems unable or unwilling to fix. You can verify this by reading through the messages on their own Quicken Community website.<br /><br />I will update this review and rating as I use Quicken Premier 2014 more and (hopefully) see updates from Intuit."
1,"The dictate features work fine, but I bought this for transcribing MP3's.  To that end, it is not very good at all.  The transcriptions were of a single clear male voice narrating.  This sort of software is always limited in that it does not detect sentence structure, punctuation, and other sorts of writing conventions unless the command is spoke.  For example the audio must say &#34;period, quote, etc&#34; in order for those things to appear.  I ignore that limitation in the review and base the rating purely on the gross inaccuracy of the words transcribed from Mp3 files.  The program has a 50% accuracy at best, making it more efficient to simply transcribe the files myself by ear.  In all, I'm very disappointed and regret this downloadable software is not returnable to Amazon."
1,"Did not have all the forms, I was missing city taxes forms.  No way to contract anyone for help.  No something i would be buying next year."
2,It is good for the prices
4,Very easy to use!
0,"At the present,turbo tax deluxe will not let me enter stock sales or farm income,wants me to get premire at $30.00 extra,I may go to another software."
0,Be careful when purchasing this product ... you will need to purchase a lot of add on products to make it work the way they advertise it!!!  Definatly NOT worth the money!!
3,I'm still trying to figure out what happen. Norton has a great reputation! prior to installing Norton I used the free avast antivirus. When i scanned avast &#34;no viruses&#34; when i scanned the new Norton 16 issues all corrected. 4 days later I got a trojan that shut me down and had to be fixed by the professionals.... I don't know how this could have happened.
1,Used basic all of these years fine. Now you have to pay the extra buckes for Dellux that you used to be able to do with Basic. Planning on using HR Block next year.
1,This Norton was purchased for use on my Macbook Pro. The program slowed down my computer so badly that I have removed it from my system. I would not recommend this for use on any Apple product.
4,"Item delivered smoothly, was as described. Very enjoyable. Great product."
4,The item arrived on time and It is really good
2,I downloaded this a few weeks ago and now I get pop ups all the time.  I never had any before I loaded 360.  Less than thrilled.
0,doesn't work--refund! took out and re-installed 6 times --sould not load sections 4&5---REFUND UTILIZED ALL YOU TROUBLE SHOOTING TECHNIQUES TO NO AVAIL!!!
1,"considering the free apps available, it's too expensive."
2,"I guess it's effective. Seems to be as good as other reputable applications. The only complaint is it gets more bloated and invasive with every update, and the advertising and informational pop-ups are annoying, in part because they stay on the screen for a long time and are so frequent. Settings can be changed to make most go away after only a second or so but it's annoying."
1,This software was supposed to include 5 free federal efiles.  We had to pay for the one and only federal efile we had.  No way to find out how to get that refunded.
0,"I had quicken a long time ago and liked it so I thought that I would give it a try again. With in minutes of downloading this I realized that it was horrible. It is too complicated. It is not user friendly at all, Its hard to figure out how to use it. I thought that maybe my husband could figure it out then teach me since he is more computer savvy. When he played with it he also agreed that it was hard to figure out how to use and that he hated it to. I am really frustrated that in trying to budget better I ended up losing money with this program."
2,"Very easy to use and navigate. My only problem, which is a biggie, is that they could not import my W2 from New York State, mine and my husband's employer! Had to enter the data manually."
3,"I was using manual spreadsheets to manage my accounts but I got tired of logging into all my banks, credit cards, investment accts etc. to copy/paste totals without categories.<br /><br />So I bought You Need a Budget 4 (YNAB4) from Steam for $10 but I guess that you get what you pay for. It is a glorified s/s without any autopull capability. Still, not a big issue since I can download statements and import into it. But it didn't categorize and I was left with having to assign categories to about 1200 entries which I didn't want to do.<br /><br />So I bought Quicken H&B 2014 based on my last usage of Quicken back in 2003 for a tax return. I recall getting a headache then with it and since then I've been going to an accountant. Still, I needed something and inspite of the lower reviews I bought Quicken and I must say it is a lot better than I imagined.<br /><br />In about 5 mins, I had setup all my accounts (at first I wasn't sure it was safe but my bank and investment and credit card companies had a section for how to auto-import data to Quicken so if it is safe for the banks to recommend it, I think I was fine with it).<br />Quicken autopulled all the data from all the places, sorted it all out in 5 seconds (some categories had to be entered manually and some had to be corrected but I am talking about 10 out of 1200 so not a big deal).<br /><br />It created reports/budgets etc. and I am happy with the output.<br /><br />There are a few bugs though -<br /><br />- for mortgage, the What if I pay extra is broken for the monthly. Inspite of saying Ie will pay extra $100/month the graph doesn't change and shows same curve as without paying extra. In reality it should drop by a few years.<br /> (EDIT: This bug is fixed as of Release 3. Yay! I like this software, does a good job)<br /><br />- sometimes credit card imports fail due to added security at credit card financial institution. The error is vague and so is the recommended fix. I ended up deactivating the online autoimport part of acct and redoing at which point it prompted me for the extra security (zip code, phone num etc.) and it all worked well after that. At least good part is it linked it back to original acct instead of creating a new one and creating a mess<br /><br />- The initial graph created for your mortgage is not accurate. Say if you started your mortgage in 2000 and are in year 13, the graph is a straight line till 2013 and then curves off. This is totally wrong. But at least rest of it is correct from present date<br /><br />- Account transfers are missing<br /><br />- Bill pay reminders don't work for credit card accounts strangely. Maybe I didn't set it up properly but I get alerts for mortgage reminders but not credit cards<br /><br />Other thoughts -<br />- the business part is not fully tested so not sure about that yet.<br />- statement reconciles etc. work well<br />- the android companion works well but you MUST create some quicken online ID, link it and upload your data there. I don't really need it and I'm not comfortable storing my data at Quicken. At least it deletes the link if you don't link to the cloud acct<br />- there is a password protect feature for using the software, storing your passwords and creating your backup files.<br />- gives the option to store your data file on some other storage medium (NAS in my case) which is good<br />- I like the automatically update all accts or some accts feature. This is so useful.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a very useful and polished piece of software compared to the almost non-existent alternatives. There are issues with it and many features that I have not yet tested fully yet (business features, tax features) because I have an accountant as well but I'm hoping it does the job there.<br /><br />Final rating : 4/5 stars. I would recommend this software for managing all your personal finances. It does a fairly good job with that."
0,Ordered this for my three kids and loaded it on my Mac. My son used it one time but the next attempt gave an error. The application doesn't work.
1,"It's labor intensive to set up and doesn't always work with financial institutions. I tried, but couldn't get several accounts to work with Quicken. I won't be buying it again. It's worthless if I can't add all of my financial accounts."
2,Can't really complain if I get something for free.  It is user friendly for some stuff and not for others.  All in all a good product for the price FREE!
0,"hate it. it's constant pop ups and bells and sirens are so much more annoying than the pop ups it's supposed to be preventing. and it seems to do almost nothing to prevent unwanted malware, ads, popups, etc. worthless. worse than worthless because it's also incredibly annoying and interrupts me constantly. hate hate hate it."

0,"I use Office 2010 every day, but had never seen the interface for Office 2013 before I purchased it. Really big change; very bland and simplistic; certainly not what one would expect from Microsoft. Fortunately, I already checked out Corel WordPerfect suite X7, and it's even worse, so I at least knew that I was getting the lesser of two s***ty looking UIs.<br /><br />The activation process is a total train wreck. The process is SUPPOSED to automatically activate my product; it did not, nor could I use the internet to complete the activation. I kept getting some obscure error code with no explanation of what the issue might be. The order confirmation email I got from Amazon was no help either, as it didn't contain any information regarding the activation process. From my perspective, everything I need to know to get that software activated should be right there in that email, and it just wasn't. Frankly, I've come to expect a lot more from Amazon, and am really surprised at how poor this experience was, especially since they're acting as Microsoft's vendor.<br /><br />When the 'activate via internet' option didn't work I tried calling in to the toll-free number. The automated voice response system didn't hear well, even though I was in a quiet room. I had to keep repeating my responses. It finally offered me the option of using my phone's keypad to enter the digit groups, and that too was a problem. Each group (A-H) consisted of 7 digits. If you didn't type in all 7 digits at one time (i.e. you paused a second or two as you typed them in), the damned IVR would respond with 'I didn't get that, so let's start over or I can transfer you to an agent'. Finally got the next-to-last group of digits entered when it apparently thought 'that's all there are', and proceeded to tell me that was an invalid code, referred me to a web site (that didn't exist, as it turned out) and HUNG UP ON ME, this time without offering to transfer me to an agent.This was about 15 minutes into the call, so I was WAY more than a little pissed off. When I called back to the toll-free number to try it again, it took a lot of responses to bypass the IVR piece of crap and get to a live agent. As it turned out, the IVR was just about as efficient as the agent; I don't mind speaking with an off-shore agent, as long as they have passable English skills. No luck with that, as it was EXTREMELY difficult to communicate with the agent. It took a LONG time for us to establish a way to communicate that worked for both of us, and I just don't think I should have to piss around like that, especially after just spending $140 on software<br /><br />Amazon and Microsoft - why can't you get your s*** together better than this? This was really a bad customer experience for a big-name product purchase. The software itself is 5-star, but the activation process from Microsoft and the non-existant supoort from Amazon made it an overall 1-star experience.WAY more than a little pissed off.

0,Waste of money. Instead try TaxAct.com which is awesome! Have used it for the last 8 years. Cost me a total of $13.99 to e-file federal and state with automatic refund deposit.
1,"I'm writing this review in protest of Intuit's new pricing structure, forcing you to buy the most expensive version if you need to do a Sch C that isnt trivial.  Like so many others, I have used TT for at least 20 years.  I was going to switch to H&R Block, but there appear to be issues with importing if you have used TT's Business version. Plus the reviews on the HRB software are at least as bad as those here.  It's too bad, because I would gladly tell Intuit to stick it. After using Quicken for 20 years as well, I dropped it after 2011.  Every version was buggier than the last, and it had gotten to the point where it was unusable. Intuit continues to ruin once great products, and does not care about it's long-time customers.  (Their once decent medical expense program, Quicken Medical Manager, was broken in version 2 and then abandoned, leaving a customer base with serious medical problems unable to even get their historical data out of the program).  If HRB figures out how to import all the business data, they may have one more convert from Intuit next year."
4,I used Microsoft Money for many years and needed to finally move to something else since it has been discontinued. I was able to import from Money into Quicken easily and near 100% accurate. I am glad I purchased it.
0,"I bought Quicken 2012 as a download from Amazon and it works -pretty good (saving data is poor);' however, they didn't provide a product key.  I complained.  They got back to me and said I didn't need one and that's why I didn't get one -WRONG!  I can't get updates unless I register the product.  I can't register without a product key.  Did you guys sell me a pirated copy?"
4,Used Intuit for years until they decided to play games with their porduct---H&R was great -- should have made the switch years ago...
1,Too expensive!
3,"The product is very good.  I have used quicken for many years and the data rolled over very nicely.  The only thing I noticed is that the program occasionally lags, not sure why."
3,I have used Norton for many years and this was easy enough to do. I will be purchasing it again in the future.
4,"Very easy to use, and very efficient"
2,"I know its my fault, but I didn't realize this didn't include my state taxes also. I am really upset that my state is going to cost as much as what I paid for this version. They do have TurboTax Deluxe Federal+ State for a few dollars more. Just know that the state is not included in this download."
0,"Did not work at all, I couldn't even open the program, it said successfully installed but it kept freezing every time I tried opening the program."
1,"I get it that Intuit needs an annual revenue source to continue to provide current code.  Why not just call it that for what it is, and stop all the bug-laden upgrade nonsense.  You could then direct your development efforts to handling investment securities that you cannot handle now.  I have had to cease using Quicken for my IRA and other investment accounts as the software will not handle GNMA's, municipal bonds  and other investment products properly.  Quicken seems to continue to work adequately for reconciling and tracking my checking account and the category accounting is very helpful, but that is as far as it goes for me."
0,This was not any better than doing my return online and HR Block support is terrible.  It cost me more this way than through turbo tax and I will never use it again.
3,"Easy to use and appears to be complete.  My only complaint is that they call it 2015 and it went on sale in mid 2014.  Since you don't get updates, on way of nothing how up to date it really is."
1,"Does not include a personal return.<br /><br />Other than that, program works great.  I called support and they sent me a personal return for free."
3,I was forced to buy the software because Adobe is not supporting higher resolution monitors with the older versions. Still a nice upgrade but nothing really compelling over the older versions other than the fact that it works on my Yoga 3 without having to use a magnifying glass to read the menus!
4,"wonderful software. works well, stable on my surface pro 3 ."
3,Can't go wrong with office.
1,"Raptr works to combine all of my gaming programs into one major client interface. However, that's the only thing it does well. There's a certain point where I don't want my Xbox Live friends knowing exactly where I've been through Facebook."
3,"The code is a good value. The codes are legit and work as expected... and mine were available right after purchase.<br />Installation can be a HUGE pain. The renewal fee on site is always outrageous but it can be the best value if you don't have time to fool with a new installation (look locally and you can probably find  a disc version for about the same cost as online renewal that you can use on 3 computers). I'm always amazed at how much trouble it can be to install McAfee programs.<br />The software is pretty good and should be trouble free after you get it installed. No antivirus program will stop everything from getting in your computer, but it does a pretty good job catching most things and it doesn't hog up all the system resources that some package solutions do (Norton especially). There will be times when you are busy and McAfee decides it is time to run a scan, so make sure you set it to scan automatically while you are normally asleep. This is the first version of McAfee in a long time that will allow you to trust a program that has been detected as malicious (using the Artemis heuristics), but you have to turn off real-time scanning, restore the file, and then add it (under real-time scanning).<br />I typed out an installation guide, but Amazon won't let me post it so here are just a few things to help you:<br /> Do an internet search for 'redeem card mcafee total protection' and you should find the home (dot) mcafee (dot) com address that you need to enter the code (If you are changing your subscription to another account then uninstall with mcpr.exe before you redeem your code or the code will get tied to the old email account).<br />If you have installation problems then go to Mcafee tech support, use the 'contact technical support' button and start a chat session (you will install a small program that lets a tech install the McAfee software for you). This is a free service with your new software so use it if you are not a computer savvy person or if you get stuck/overwhelmed.<br /><br />If you are trying to do it yourself, then you will most likely need to uninstall any Mcafee software (use their tool, MCPR.exe), set the security zones (Internet zone especially) in your 'Internet Options' to their lowest settings. Turn off any and all security programs and firewalls (Windows will enable Windows Defender after you uninstall and the realtime protection must be turned off). Don't uninstall anything else, just make sure it's off. If you get stuck anywhere with the install program it means you have something on your system blocking access to the McAfee file servers (firewall or proxy) or blocking installation if everything downloaded correctly (other security settings in Internet Options or programs like Windows Defender).<br />Remember, you can always let tech support take over if you get stuck.helmed.

0,Very difficult to use.  I deleted it.
0,"I was unable to active this product online, and manual activation requires that you contact the Paragon 'support team.'  When I called the number for Paragon support provided by amazon.com, their canned phone menu indicates that to speak to anyone you must pay for support.  I'm grateful that amazon.com has made an exception in this case to their &#34;no refunds&#34; policy for software downloads (although that took two calls).  Paragon certainly made a bad first impression, and I'll be avoiding their products in the future."
0,"I have been a user of this tool since the late 80s or early 90s, don't remember exactly. Each iteration of Quicken since Quicken 99 is more cumbersome, and difficult to use than its predecessor. With Quicken 2014 I believe they have passed into being worse than useless. The tool will not subtract cost of securities from my cash column, crashes on each attempt to backup, and on other actions that I have not narrowed down yet. I deeply regret downgrading to this most recent version."
1,This was a freeware product.  You have to purchase a &#34;full&#34; copy to use many of the features and it nag you every time you tried to use it.
2,Have used TurboTax in the past and it works well but it has become to pricey when you have to pay for Federal app and then Sate app and then pay 20 bucks to file  Everything total this year was over $100.00
4,All the aspects of Quicken are about the same as previous years. The only new thing is the credit following and FICA score. They haven't got all the bugs worked out for these 2 new items.
3,Price is right and product easy to install.  I'm not the kind of user to notice much of a difference but had to upgrade to Windows 7 Pro to do my volunteer tax work this season.
4,It is a great program. The only complaint is with downloading and registering. It is a little muddled on the process and seems to be harder than it needed to be. But it was very nice and convenient to have it waiting in my AMAZON digital library.
2,It's alright.
1,"The product is ok -- gets the job done, been using it every year. I'll keep leaving 2 star reviews for as long as they keep hiding the state e-filing fee deep inside the product."
3,"This is a pretty good piece of software for basic use -- not intelligent enough to handle complex small business nuances, but great for the everyday user. The help could be better, but a the software is a very good value overall -- particularly with the state efile option. A quick TurboTax comparison last year revealed minimal differences for everyday users and AtHome is much cheaper. Stupid name -- they should have stuck with TaxCut."
0,"very complex, not designed to create frame by frame animation, switch layer tool is broken, not even the book written by chad could help, the frame limit is 3000 frames, so you can only create 2 minutes of animation. its a rip off, do not waste your money with this product."
0,got a bad virus when I changed to this
1,Not worth the money. Using on iPhone and samsung phones worthless
0,"I'm sad to have to leave a review like this but after over two months of trying to get a solution I am stuck with a broken product.<br /><br />When I first purchased Quicken 2013 I, like many, needed an upgrade from my older Quicken software so that I could use it with online banking. Sadly from the start this product wouldn't work with my Paypal business account despite claims on Intuit's website that it would.<br /><br />My first point of contact with Intuit product support was via a live chat. The support person had never heard of Paypal. Obviously that was a bad start seeing as how Paypal is one of the biggest providers of payment and banking over the internet. I was referred to their e-mail support. Fine.<br /><br />I started what began a huge series of support e-mails where often I would need to send the same information again and again since the current reader of the e-mail in my support ticket hadn't read the previous entry. Twice during this process the return e-mails stopped. When I sent another e-mail asking what happened I was told, twice, that they had 'accidentally closed my support ticket' and I had to start the entire process from the beginning.<br /><br />Here I am over two months past the point of first contacting Intuit about my simple issue and there is nothing resolved. Their responses have stopped again and I'm going to see about requesting a refund via Amazon. Very, very disappointing."
1,"I used this product some years ago, so the exact details of my experience are a bit fuzzy.<br /><br />Every computer I have purchased over the last fifteen years or so, I've opted out, or uninstalled Microsoft Office - because it adds so much to the cost of a new machine, and until recently I haven't needed it. Not only that, the nag messages to update (pay $350+ dollars to get the full version) were annoying.<br /><br />Within the past five years or so, I found I needed a word processor, and a website that I frequent suggested Open Office. I checked it out, and it seemed legit, so I started using it frequently. I was quite satisfied for a long time - several months I believe, possibly longer. And contrary to what others report, I did not get any viruses from it, or anything similar, and it didn't slow down my computer, although I did download it directly from the publisher's website.<br /><br />However, it did stop working after a while. I remember doing some writing one day, saving it, and while trying to open the program the next day, it just wouldn't work, period. No error messages or anything, it simply quit. So, I do what I always do when I come across a program acting glitchy, I uninstalled it, and reinstalled it. I do believe the program worked, but when I tried opening saved documents, the recovery function kept telling me the files were corrupted, and it couldn't open them. I ran my virus scanners just to be safe. Nothing turned up.<br /><br />I finally decided to look for an alternative, and after trying several highly inferior &#34;free&#34; product, I found one that is almost identical to AOO, but made by a different publisher. It's called Libre Office, and it is completely free, with all the bells and whistles. I have been using it for at least four years now, and have never had any problems. I recommend it as an alternative to Open Office. &#34;You get what you pay for&#34; doesn't always apply. Just because one free program has (allegedly) lost its way, doesn't mean all of them have.<br /><br />Rated two stars because it did work. For a while.ay, doesn't mean all of them have.<br /><br />Rated two stars because it did work. For a while."
0,Program would not allow me to do a form 982.  I purchased HR Block's and no problems at all.  I should be able to return this gargage.
0,"This garbage virus scanner has been &#34;detecting&#34; threats from other software on my computer and deleting the exe and dll files so that it cannot run without being reinstalled, some of this software I no longer have the install discs for and is now lost. This free virus scanner is now costing me money. Not to mention all of the pop-ups telling me to do useless things on my computer and then tells me I need to pay for an upgrade to do them."
1,"I've used Quicken for more than 12 years. With each upgrade, the software gets slower and more buggy. Now, I've been locked out of my data file for more than two weeks, because of a flaw in a patch issued by Quicken. I've spent hours trying to follow Quicken's unhelpful online instructions. Their phone customer support is non-existent.<br /><br />I'm ready to move to another personal finance software. Unfortunately, Quicken is one of the few products available with comprehensive features to manage multiple types of financial accounts, and migrating Quicken data to another product is risky."
2,"I was forced to upgrade to Quicken 2013 because my new computer runs Windows 8, and Quicken 2012 wasn't compatible with it.  So imagine how happy I am after splashing out to find that I'm still getting compatibility issues...NOT!  And Quicken still hasn't sorted out downloading with foreign currencies or banks, or even with my US credit union.  I've used Quicken for 20+ years now, but every year I wonder if there isn't something that would give me more value for money."
0,Tried to cancel. No luck
2,"Protects computer, but slows it down. I much perfer MSE now."
4,Norton Security absolutely met my expectations.  It is simple to load (one does not need an IT department to load it) and runs just like Norton Internet Security.  Norton Security is a fine virus protection suite that does NOT slow down one's computer as other antivirus suites do.  Norton is a trusted name in virus protection and is extremely easy to use.  Getting 10 seats for the price I paid was a fantastic value!
1,"Same complaints as everyone else. I have intermittent connectivity issues with the mobile portion of the product. I have used Mint for sometime, without a problem with any accounts. So in moving to Quicken, since they own Mint, it would be a seamless transition. After having a few issues connecting with all of my accounts on the desktop version the first few days, it finally started to sync after about a week. But that was after hours of going back and forth with Quicken Support (which was responsive) and trying to figure out why it wasn't syncing. I still do not know what fixed the desktop issue. But the MOBILE app is why I purchased the product to begin with. And this has been a problem from day 1. I still cannot sync with one of my banks. (It syncs fine with Mint, so again I don't know why it wouldn't with the Quicken mobile app. I have uninstalled, re-installed, reset password, changed password with bank, logged back in, sync on desktop then tried with mobile app -- I have done everything Quicken's Support has told me to do, again and again...still not syncing to my online bank account. Like I said, I have Mint and that syncs fine. But would like the Quicken product to do what it is advertised to do, and for the price I paid it should."
0,BUYER BEWARE!  You have to buy Microsoft Office 365 to install this.  It is not a true stand alone product.
1,Pricey!
3,Did everything I needed it to...been using TurboTax for years. It just works. It lets me do up to 5 returns (Fed and State) which is perfect for my family.
1,"I don't trust this company at all. I recently received a free copy of Incomedia WebSite X5 Home 11 from a legitimate source. It installed a search engine on my Firefox browser that deleted my home page tabs and set itself up as my search engine. I was able to get rid of it using some anti-malware software, but it wasn't a good experience. I didn't even have an opportunity to find out if it was a good website maker - I deleted it as fast as possible!"
0,"I have used Office for years in its evolving versions.  The cloud-based nature is helpful in making it possible to view and edit files from any internet-connected computer. The iPhone app connects nicely and has been very helpful.<br /><br />BUT...<br />I have had continual and repeated problems with at least two serious problems. And these are simple things that have worked fine in previous versions for years!  Sometimes, a Word document will open with the ruler across the top showing (that's good, I have selected that option), but the margin setting tabs won't show up!  Forum comments suggested doing a repair through the PC control panel.  I did  that, and it worked - margin tabs showed up again. For two days.  Now today, they're gone again!  This time I tried closing all 3 Word files I had open, restarted, and the tabs were showing up in the ruler again. But this is ridiculous. I use the margin setting tabs in the ruler a Lot; the necessity of going to ribbon on top, finding the margin settings and going through that process is very tedious.  But at least the tabs work some of the time, if I restart the program...<br /><br />Another issue has been unresolved and never works.  The scroll bar quits working. While using the up or down arrow on the scroll bar, it works fine until you quit moving your mouse. If you don't move the mouse or click for three seconds, the scroll bar becomes inoperative until you move off the scroll bar then back on. I often sit without mouse activity on the scroll bar arrow while reviewing a document, then click to move down again.... nothing, until I move off the scroll bar and back on.  Help forums have constant activity discussing this issue with very little resolution.  Response from Microsoft: nothing.<br /><br />There are also occasions where either microsoft 2013, or the microsoft account tells me I need to put in my password again to access the file versions in the cloud.  It tells me my password is wrong, or goes to log in and thewindow (&#34;this will just take a moment&#34;) stays open forever, until I force MS Word to close using con-alt-delete.  The next day, everything logs in just fine.  The different entities involved in the cloud-based functioning are confusing (Microsoft account, Microsoft 2013, Office 360, I still don't understand which account is operating... there may only be two, I don't know, but it's frustrating when it works one day, but not the next.)<br /><br />Keeping my perspective, it's a good program and cloud-based concept, but the small issues are distracting and radically impact my productivity.  If Microsoft can deal with the little frustrations, the overall experience will be good.... like it was in previous versions.... decades ago.  Ah, progress.  While trying to catch up with the rest of the computing world, I hope Microsoft doesn't lose sight of the fundamentals... like making a program that actually works."
3,"I love Turbo Tax, I use it for our personal taxes, too. The only thing that irritates me is they charge $50 for the state filing, then come to find out, you can't even efile in Oregon. So it cost me $50 to print out the state form. What a rip-off. SO, go ahead and buy this, just make sure you know the cost is not really what it says-add $50 on to it."
0,They should have called it Total Garbage. Can't download -- get Bad Hostname error.  Amazon was great with a quick refund.
0,"I use to love WinDVD; nevertheless, this latest version of WinDVD has an embedded program that tracks what type of films you watch. I don't know how WinDVD uses this information, yet it is frightening to know the damage that this information could do to your professional or personal life if it fell in the wrong hands. My privacy and peace of mind are priceless. I'll have to make do without you WinDVD, sorry."
4,"This is a great antivirus product.  It provides excellent protection, and with automatic updating, I don't have to be concerned about PC safety."
0,I've spent countless hours trying to get this to work over the last nine months.  I think they released it with zero testing so that the customers could do the testing. A nightmare.
2,"I've been using quicken for a while and was forced to upgrade to 2011.  This version is good, but definitely some bugs with reconciling statements."
3,"really cleans and no hassle ,have it for 5 years now...and will keep it software in my laptop.<br />awesome thanks"
0,"Have used TurboTax for years and have always been very happy--until this year.  I do taxes for several family members and have always used the Deluxe version.  This year, after purchasing Deluxe and installing it, I learned that I would need Premier in order to do my mother-in-law's taxes.  I have not had to do her taxes before.  I was told I could get a $25 refund if I had used Deluxe version last year, but needed Premier this year.  I paid $20 more just to get a couple of schdules that have always been included on Deluxe.  I didn't qualify for the $25 refund because I didn't file our own taxes, even though I still purchased and used both versions.  Our personal taxes involved special circumstances I didn't feel qualified to tackle.  Very unhappy with TurboTax this year!!!"
3,"After 10 plus years of TurboTax, I was reluctant to switch, but I have had it with Intuit. Happy to report, the switching was pretty painless. The software is not perfect, but, it is as good as Turbotax, and better, in some ways. You will still have to occasionally do your own research for less common situations, but the links within software and the explanations are good to fair. The web takes care of the rest.  Combine it with affordability, as compared to Turbotax, and the fact that you are not getting fewer features for more money, but getting MORE features for less money, and HR Block software shines.  There is really no single massive drawback I can point to, again, after coming off 10+ years of Turbotax experience."
3,I had Quicken 2007 and have been putting off purchasing a new version until this came along.  It is a good way of keeping a checking account in balance.
4,Good Free Buy!
4,I went to the Turbo Tax website and researched the version I would need for my tax situation. The one Turbo Tax recommended did the job in a straightforward manner with all the tools necessary for filing my taxes successfully.
2,No problems with the purchase or download. This was an easy way to get tax software for prior year returns.
4,great
3,works good so far.
2,I got this way back as a demo and installed fine. This time buying<br />from Amazon requires you to edit a config file which I still cannot<br />figure out. I try every few days when I am rested again. Maybe I<br />should chat with the SAM people directly. Heard about it from<br />the book.

2,"It is true that if you want to delete this from your machine, it takes some doing (and googling).

0,"I recently moved from Windows to MAC and thought I would do the same with Quicken and ordered the MAC version - little did I know that Bill Pay ISN'T available on the MAC version.  Unbelievable.  If I had known that, I would have never purchased the product.  Very disappointing."
4,it works great i really like and it was easy to instal i just downloaded it to my computer and i was set to go
4,No damaging occurrences have made it through to our computer.  Avast doesn't seem to slow the computer at all and all dangers have been blocked.
2,Kaspersky is what I have used before but this time my renewal had safe money added.  Not sure what the problem is yet but 2 of my bills I pay through my bank are now blocked by Kaspersky.
1,"My computer has never run so slow and had so many problems. I purchased Norton for the increased security but am regretting this. My old security, though free, kept me virus free and my computer ran much better."
0,Gouged with fees at the end 24 .99 to file state taxes then 34.99 if u take it out of your refund Omg Turbo  I already paid for the state taxes wtf I have used you every year now I can go out and have it done for the same price.........
0,"I recently was forced to upgrade from Elements 8 to 12. Unfortunately, Adobe offers VERY poor support, and they charge for this with Elements (and everything else that isn't a subscription product). I had a very simple question  related to a change made from the version I was familiar with. I tried chat, but after an extended time Chat couldn't help as no &#34;technical&#34; representative was available; that happened twice. The 2nd time I pointed out that there was no support number listed on the website for PSE, just the subscription products. I was given a number--after 45 minutes, mainly spent waiting, I was informed that she was not trained in this area, she was just &#34;Customer Service&#34; not &#34;technical&#34; and I would have to pay for a conversation with someone who could answer my question. I gave up in disgust, but I did eventually figure out my answer--what had been on a top menu was buried way down deep.<br /><br />For a long time PSE was the only product really available at this level--much to offer the serious photographer but not designed exclusively for professionals. I am hearing more about other good competition now, and I will definitely be looking at switching.<br /><br />Adobe's idea of Customer Service is simply too poor to consider &#34;Service&#34; at all.<br /><br />As an aside, I downloaded directly from Adobe, not Amazon, as I had contacted Adobe about my inability to re-install Version 8 from my disk. I was given a new serial number to download 8, but was warned that they would not support it. Since only the organizer portion (Bridge) worked, I had to buy the updated version.<br /><br />A big thumbs down to Adobe for forgetting the customer."
2,"If I had my choice I would not have upgraded to the new version of quicken. But I did receive a notification (one of their popups) indicating that I needed to upgrade, otherwise I would not be able to get my transactions from my financial institutions automatically. I have been fighting with the new software to do exactly that. I try to download transactions from one particular (very big bank) and I always get the message \\""Sorry, we encounter an error. It's not your fault\\""... Then whose fault it is? No more explanations. \\""The improvements\\"" are not really improvements but things that you already had, they just made them more difficult to find in the program. Don't update to this version unless you really have to do it."
2,"Have used Turbo Tax Fed for years satisfactorily. Tried Fed + State E-file for2014. Fed = ok, State not so. Used Alabama state tax forms from web site. Fed refund rapid."
4,What can you say. It does what it is supposed to.<br /><br />I have been using this software for several years.<br />It is very easy to use in my opinion.<br /><br />You can't beat the price by doing a download through Amazon.
1,"This is in regards to the downloaded version of 2011 Turbo Tax Deluxe...  Prior year data imported properly.  Easy to fill in the data.  However, the e-file function kept giving a message that my return was already filed under the the same social security number.  The result is, I can't electronically file my return.  I called customer service at Turbo Tax, and after 40 minutes they verified my return was not filed with the IRS under any social security numbers listed on my return.  Now I'm waiting for a call back from Turbo Tax once they fix the software problem to e-File.  What should have been a routine e-File has cost me at least 1.5 hours of extra time, and the situation is not yet resolved. Not to mention I have the $20 fee tied up on my credit card for State e-filing."
2,in past the deluxe turbo tax included the state tax for the same price I paid for this I am disappointed
4,"Nice product, especially for the price!  ;)"
3,"Eh, it's tax software so how excited can you get about it but works well, easy to use and less expensive than a CPA."
4,"I recently upgraded to Elements 11 and Premiere Elements 11 from Elements 10. This is my first upgrade since Elements 10 was my initial experience with Adobe Photoshop products. I am thrilled with my decision to step up to the newer version. The software is easy to use for even a newbie like me. I find that I can do so many creative things with my photos and videos that I did not even realize was possible. The helps and information available to guide me through any process I want to try is vast, and most is found in step-by-step directions. That's a real plus for a beginner. I am so excited at the limitless possibilities that are in store for my future photos and videos with this wonderful photo/video editing software."
0,Does not work as instruction explained
2,don't know if I did the right thing after a few months using it.
3,I am completely happy with this software. It is organized and easy to use. I have been using for the past several years and have used it to print my own cookbook and to keep track of family recipes. The software support has always solved any problem that I may have come upon quickly and efficiently. I love it so much that I purchased copies for my children. I am also please that I have always been upgraded to the newest version without extra charges. This is wonderful software.
1,"As a software engineer, I can say that if I wrote a program like this, I would be likely wind up as a greeter at Walmart.  Since Quicken has been around for a sufficiently long time, I would expect the program to evolve adding incremental features and correcting bugs.  The fact that they control the personal financial market seems to give them the power to put out crap and get away with it.  The reason I had to go to 2013 was they were going to obsolete the downloading protocols and and I could be left with no transaction download capability.  So I bit the bullet.  That was a mistake.<br /><br />Among the problems:<br /><br />1. Unreliable downloads from brokerage houses.  I get wrong securities displayed and wrong numbers.  I am constantly correcting balances and securities manually.  In many cases, I have to delete the security than re-enter it to reflect the current balance and holdings.  And there is no way to permanently exclude inactive accounts that are still active on the brokers records, so I have to repetitively \\""ignore\\"" them manually.<br /><br />2. Anytime modifications are made you are prompted for a password.  Unfortunately, You have to enter your password in all caps rather than the one you generated.  This bug has been around from other versions but at least in 2013, they now mention it.  This is just plain dumb and should have been corrected long ago.<br /><br />3. The security descriptions that you enter involve multiple menus that are a PITA to navigate through.  Some of the fields are cryptic and could use pop-up explanations like modern programs (this is true for other features as well).<br /><br />4. I am frequently be prompted for OK's on new transaction securities that the program can't resolve.  The program doesn't tell me what the exact problem is, just whether the security exists and it wants me to approve it.  What the hell is the download for?  This is especial true when the brokerage house makes adjustments that obviously confuse Quicken).<br /><br />5. Some of my credit card accounts will not talk to Quicken because the institution finds it a pain to deal with Intuit.<br /><br />6. In terms of usability, much of the program is non-intuitive.  And Help is online and seems to be either insufficient or convoluted if there is any complexity to the problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there's not much out there to replace this object oriented monstrosity."
2,"It's hard to understand , but it seems to help my computer. I am buying a new computer and I'm not sure I will use it on that one"
4,"Highly recommended for home computers! Easy to use and quite effective!! Once installed, it operates in the back ground stealthily."
2,"Not bad as any &#34;xxx for Mac&#34; product can be.  I'm able to do what I need to so I'm satisfied, although the desktop for PC is much better."
4,This is the best!  I wouldn't use anything else.  I have been using WordPerfect for over twenty years.
0,"Why do they all seem to require a trip to the internet to use graphics??  I do a lot of my work offline, and this was impossible.  Also, a lot of the best functions were hard to find or not available at all.  It's slow to use, and buggy to load.  A total waste of money that I did not have to waste."
4,Great product and a great price.
2,I have repeated problems with brushes. They take off on their own making repeated actions across my project…I have to repeatedly erase the error before I can escape and change brushes or tools. I've tried to find out if anyone else has this problem and can't get any answers. So…I rate it lower than I would have otherwise.
1,The download for this software seems to be hard to install. Another gift given but the receiver is having difficulty in downloading it. It worked for me on my computer though
1,"The state download doesn't work.  I won't let me download for free.  Intuit is no help, there is no number to call for help."
1,"TurboTax sent an email explaining the change and removal of schedules citing customer confusion.  Yea, and this explanation didn't help my confusion much.  So what exactly was the reason?<br /><br />  Here's why we made the change. Over the years, we have worked hard to make it easy for you to choose the TurboTax product that is right for you and your unique tax situation. We want that choice to be clear and confidence inspiring. However, as new online and mobile technologies emerged, our products, and the tax scope and features they included, began to differ, leading to customer confusion. These differences also impeded our ability to introduce new innovations across our entire product line.<br /> So this year, we made the product experience consistent across all TurboTax offerings. This change enables us to innovate faster and make improvements that benefit all customers at the same time, regardless of whether they use our online or desktop software. You can be sure that we've preserved what's unique to our desktop product: the ability to e-file up to five returns, switch to forms mode and install the software on multiple computers. Find the TurboTax product that's right for you.<br /><br />For basic taxes TurboTax is probably still good.  But the forced upgrade will probably drive me elsewhere next year like H&R Block.  Hope they don't follow suit next year."
1,I shouldn't have downloaded this upgrade.  Ever since I did I'm getting doubles of my accounts that have to be deleted over and over.
4,This an excellent product to help students it covers all software needed to complete colledege assignments. The tech support for Microsoft is amazing a great software program for students on the path of success!
1,"The Federal return went fine.  State returns were another story.  I live in MD and work in DC, Turbo Tax insisted I needed to file a DC nonresident return.  When I did so, Intuit took $40 from me and then told me there was nothing to file.<br /><br />So I paid $40 for Turbo Tax to instantly change its mind and tell me there was no refund or amount due for DC.  This is either a software bug or a scam.  Either way I'm not using Turbo Tax again.<br /><br />So if you work in the District of Columbia and live in another state, I recommend ignoring Turbo Tax when it tries to get you to file a second state return in DC.  It is an expensive waste of your time.  I guess I should have known better, it seemed really odd to have to file two state returns.<br /><br />Edit - Intuit refunded the $40 after I sent a couple of Emails according to Amazon's resolution policies.  So I'm not out any $, but its nonetheless a bug in the software.  To be fair, it earns them a star back."
2,"This is the tool I have used almost exclusively for the past 15 years. The only difference this year was my switching to Mac OS and hence ordering Mac version of the software. From interface point of view, I did not feel much delta between the Windows version and the Mac. Both smooth and easy to use. The Mac version was easily installed. I was also able to import my last year's taxes done on the Windows version to the Mac with a few easy steps. So, no issue with the cross platform migration.<br />As for the tool itself, in overall, I have seen it evolving over the years. On the surface the software is very user friendly and takes the user through the process while keeping complex calculations under the hood. What has worried me over the past couple of years (especially this year) is some assumptions and short-cuts the tool takes in filling out the forms with user's little or no knowledge. Last year, I found out IRS had fixed my schedule C through my lender when a copy of submitted form was compared against IRS records (fortunately, there was no impact to the bottom line). This year, I came to know (purely by accident) that software dropped some of my qualified expenses without notifying me. Unfortunately, did not have time to get help with it so I ended up not claiming a few hundred dollars! So, seems that all the customization and effort to make the tool more useful is taking toll on the accuracy of the end result. Yes, Turbo Tax guarantees its accuracy, bla bla... the above observations have convinced my wife and I to perhaps have a professional tax preparer go over our last couple of years tax filings; just to put our minds at ease."
1,"I used to have a PC.  I loved Quicken; my last PC version was 2009.<br />While I have made it work, this is not the Quicken I knew."
3,Overall very good although it could benefit from the inclusion of a simplified format such as the old federal E-Z form as the menu is excessively complicated for simple returns.
0,"This review isn't about exactly the Perfect 365 product but rather about the ArcSoft company technical support policy. I purchased the Portrait+ 3.0 Photoshop Plugin software directly from this company and installed it my Win 7 computer. I tried to open perfect portrait photo within this plug-in and find out the face couldn't detected. So, I  tried to contact the technical support and find out there is a ridiculous tech support policy - 2-3 business days response time especially for the company who claim their self as a Global Leader In Imaging Technology . I would like to be fair. On my other computer I have Portrait+ version 2 and it's working acceptably well. The company management and marketing team need to understand any product only as good as the support behind it.  So, back to my issue, October 14th I sent the request for support and finally on October 20th I received an answer from the tech support rep. Nancy explaining to me that I don't have stable Internet connection this is why my software doesn't work correctly. I consider myself advanced computer user with more than 20 years of experience in installations, setup, troubleshooting etc. and I can say for sure I have very stable 25 Mbps Down and 10 Mbps Up Internet connection. First of all sorry, I can't accept this explanation as a logical, second - what I have to do for locations where I can't establish an Internet connection???. So, I restore my computer from the image I created before I install ArcSoft software to make sure I have clean computer without any ArcSoft traces. I install the software one more time. Unfortunately I get the same result. &#34;Face Can't be detected!&#34;. l sent the new question to ArcSoft with my direct phone number as well (just in case if they so kind to return the call) and I guess I will have to wait now for another who knows how long. In my opinion it is very unfair to the customers to not be able to call or at least live chat to the technical support team as need it. Meanwhile I have non working software I paid for because it doesn't work the way it promised and company seems like not belong of the 21st Century standards! This is exactly why I agree with Scott's statement to STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!"
4,"Love the new version.  It keeps getting better each year.  And, it was so easy to download and transfer all of my previous years' data.  It's fantastic."
3,I've used this program in several versions over the last few years. I'm not a professional photographer but I do a lot of photography and have found this program to do all of the functions I need and it's reasonable to figure out. For the price it does a great job of editing photos. As for the registering it's been a good deal for me I get half price upgrades and they are a very easy company to get help from.
0,"CAUTION! Microsoft Window 8.1 users. According to technical support at Nuance, OmniPage 18 is NOT fully compatible with Windows 8.1. Supposedly, if you are running Windows 7, or even Windows XP SP3, you should not experience compatibility issues. Windows 8.1 users need to upgrade to, or purchase, OmniPage 19 Ultimate for proper operation. Apparently Nuance, in their infinite wisdom, decided to ignore Windows 8.1 users and go straight to version 19. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
4,I have used Norton products for over 15 years and have never been disappointed in their performance.  Norton Internet Security has saved my computer many times with warnings about websites.  It is the best!
0,"If wasting your life staring at at a computer monitor in a state of fury and bewilderment is how you swing, then this software is for you.  At the heart of the Movavi program is its \\""{do nuthin'\\"" design.  The Do Nuthin' concept is easy for even the novice computer user to grasp.  Simply stated, the software does almost nothing.  But Video Editor 7 doesn't stop there.  The folks at Movavi have tweaked the program with something they call \\""Double-secret Probation\\"".  While you are wasting precious hours, this background app is busy convincing you that you are actually producing results!  Video Editor 7 incorporates this concept to stunning effect.  You drag and you drop - click this and click that - type the name of your project, type it again, and then one more time.  When you're done you have thirty seconds of a sort of graphic prelude for your video, unusually tacky and decked out with lots of default terms.  It doesn't seem to have anything to do with your video?  Don't be concerned; it doesn't make any difference.  When you burn to disc, you won't be burning your video.  All you're going to record is one half minute of that dumb introductory graphic labeled \\""My Video\\"".  \\""I must have made a mistake,\\"" you think.  Video Editor 7's opens up its \\""Drunk Monkey vid files, and informs you, with astounding accuracy, of the date and time.  Chronology all you're going to get, it doesn't know beans about the video you loaded earlier, so you load all the files in again.  After a couple of hours, you go to the kitchen and put you dvd's down beside the  potato peels, and coffee grounds, rancid butter, and moldy old bread.  You study the Editor 7 website, but there doesn't seem to be anything in the google ads that might help.  There are matters that human reason can not address.  You've got to have that Sixth Sense to deal with Ole' 7.  The Amazing Kreskin, and old movie actresses who channel Albert Einstein may be able to record their home movies, but for the rest of us, it's not to be.  Best to look upon Movavi Video Editor 7 as one might the Bubonic Plague.  Please note: the terms: \\""Do Nuthin'\\"", \\""Double-secret Probation\\"", and the \\""Drunken Monkey\\"" video library are intend to be satirical - there isn't anything by any of those names in the software.  Also.  I'm not a doctor, but I don't believe Video Editor software can kill a person the way the Black Death did.  I really don't think so, but then, as just stated, I am not a doctor."
1,I do not like the new version of Microsoft Office I prefer the Office 2010 because it is easier to use.  This was a waste of money.
2,It wasn't that easy to work with. mind you I just played with it for a little while. I couldn't figure out for the life of me how to do the roof or how to show elevations. getting the initial plan wasn't that bad but taking it further was not too intuitive.
2,Not as user friendly as Quicken but it works on a iMac and thats a big plus. Worth trying if you want to get away from a PC
2,Nice to be able to reall know day to day where my $ is.  Have not used all features yet as new person to doing all own finances it's not as simple as I thought it would be.  I did have call them for help ....it worked in the end but I had to restart everything so that stunk.
2,"I bought PowerDirector 11 Ultimate to replace Avid Studio because the latter doesn't run properly on Windows 8 Pro 64-bit and there doesn't seem to be any support for it any more.  PowerDirector's interface is almost identical to Pinnacle and Avid Studio, which means it isn't very intuitive but good enough once you learn the ropes.  Performance on my Windows 8 Pro 64-bit, six core 3.7 Ghz CPU, 16 GB memory and Nvidia Quadro 1GB video card pretty good.  Much better than Avid or Pinnacle on the same PC.<br />The effects library is pretty thin and most of the contributions are aimed at home movie creation."
4,good
1,Messed up my computer. I lost money and received stress.  Do not get anything Norton.  My computer is now being repaired by Geek Squad.<br /><br />Arthur Bourdon
0,Did not work
4,This antivirus blocks more than McAfee and Norton and is free. I have never had any issues with this product.
2,The license download is for the 2012 Edition and the license does not allow you to upgrade to WhiteSmoke's newest version.  I had installation issues and my two tickets at WhiteSmoke's service desk went unanswered even after having a chat session with their online sales support.  I did get it to work on a second machine and the functionality is slightly better than Microsofts spelland grammar checkers. Amazon's interaction was flawless as far as the purchase and download was concerned.
1,"Was not what I thought. Thought it allowed remote access to account through mobile phone, not the case. Plus reviews say it can crash cell phones so did not download. Also don't like how the lower reminder register opens every time. Tried to call and get my money back, want to return to Quicken 2013, but was blocked at every point on the phone and website. I have used Quicken successfully for many years, usually upgrade as I get a new computer. Since my partner and I are currently living in separate states, the remote view would be nice. And if I could get someone to actually speak with me, maybe could have figured this out.Going to try again, this just happened to come through first."
1,"I've been a long time Quicken user (for at least 12 years) -- I usually upgrade every few years, and have been uniformly happy with the upgrades... until 2013.<br /><br />When I first installed the upgrade, I would have given this 1 star -- there were lots of things that just weren't functional (for instance, the net worth report didn't even display, and claimed all my balances were zero). In the intervening weeks, I've mostly straightened all that out by removing things from the dashboard, re-adding them, and reconfiguring them. Not a pleasant upgrade experience at all -- but at least it's usable now.<br /><br />The one persistent complaint (as echoed by other reviewers) is that EVERYTHING is really slow. Entering transactions all have a delay after them, starting up the program has a lengthy delay before I can even enter the vault password to open the file (lengthy enough that I usually click on it to see if it's responsive, get a windows \\""this applications is not responding, kill it\\"" dialog, and then it eventually comes back to life).<br /><br />For someone that didn't need new functionality (like the mobile support), but mostly wanted just the slickness, usability, and performance that comes with a typical Quicken update, this upgrade has been abysmal. I hope that Intuit will soon patch this and bring it back to the stellar product that it was in previous years."
4,"I scan documents of 200 pages plus.  I have to upload them.  I can only upload max 20MB.  So I just hit the split button,  Immediately my document is split into smaller documents at the range I set of 10MB and renamed with part 1 part 2 etc.  How sweet is that?  I scan 98 page magazines which I upload but don't want to split -- scan in grayscale and it drops the size by 87% -- wow, I was amazed.  Oh, my page is upside down and I've saved it already.  No problem, just open and click to open thumbnails and right click, rotate.  Done.  Oh, I want to add more pages some color and some grayscale -- again, no problem, one click.  I want to scan more pages to the doc, no problem -- hit tools, add, from a file, from the scanner-- many choices.  I want to remove pages, but don't want to delete them-- no problem -- extract!  I LOVE THIS PROGRAM!  I can crop and do everything with such ease.  It is so worth the money.  No longer spending hours struggling and I can read the documents because it's so easy to change the dpi settings under custom scan-- Yesterday I had pages 16 by 101/2 to scan - again, no problem under custom scan -- just change the page size and it automatically tells your scanner for you. I LOVE THIS PROGRAM!!"
4,Arguably the best editing software on the market. Takes a good photo and makes it great!
2,"It's okay to use. It walks you through things well but at the basic level (I've used basic and deluxe), you would do just as well to use the IRS website or a free software program. Easy download through Amazon without any glitches."
2,Not very versital and downloaded extra stuff I don't want.
0,too slow and it didn't link with the bank as promised.  I ended up going back to my previous version.
0,"I do NOT recommend this program for business purposes. I am self employed and needed software primarily to log my work, to produce invoices, and to keep track of accounts receivable and expenses ... so I chose Quicken Home & Business. Had I known the ability to keep track of the work I'm doing was severely flawed I would NOT have bought this program.<br /><br />[When producing an invoice, you would enter all the expected information (customer, dates, amount, DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK, etc.). After producing these invoices, you would then expect that information to be available to you in other places ... like, say, the register. But, no. The register allows you to see the date, invoice number, customer, amount, expense category and whether it has cleared/been paid. But it does not include the job description. The DESCRIPTION field in the invoice is thus essentially useless. If you'd like to see in the register what invoice #123 was for, you would have had to type your description AGAIN in to the memo field. (Or go back and open invoice #123 again.) The memo field shows up but not the description?? Why not just type the job description in to the memo field then. A) that leaves a big blank space in the middle of your invoice and B) frankly it's just not INTUITIVE. If you need to produce a statement at the end of the week and needed it to reflect the work that was done, forget it. Not even the memo field is available on that. The statement does have a DESCRIPTION field ... but the information auto-populated there is instead the invoice number. What?? There is also a job/project list but the job/project field is populated by, you guessed it, the invoice number. I don't know about you, but I would rather have the description of the work I did to reference and refer back to instead of just an invoice number as my source.]<br /><br />Intuit's technical support is awful. It is very, very slow and not especially helpful. I would not buy this program again, will not buy anotherIntuit program, and I would not recommend this software to anyone who hopes to find it useful for business."
3,"Norton Security gives you more protection than last year at a slightly higher cost, when my year subscription runs out I will be forced to pay $80.00 at the Norton site or $60.47 (at the time of this review) at Amazon. My advice is that you wait to buy or renew it close to the holiday season when it goes on sale, otherwise you will be paying close to retail pricing.<br />Now the user interface has been redesigned as a white background with green signaling whether or not your system is secure.<br />The LiveUpdate is okay, but it doesn't update every fifteen minutes like last year, it updates when it feels like it.<br />You have good control over the features and settings.<br />The Identity Safe has been improved for all the browser sites and is clean, it feels secure as it should be.<br />You can turn on a feature so that when you are watching a movie or gaming Norton will go into a quiet like mode and not scan or use up resources so your game/movie won't be impacted.<br />The Performance section is a nice touch, clean your internet browser traces and windows temporary files, though nothing for the recycle bin sadly. There is a startup manager and a disk optimizer, which can help you keep your device as fast as possible.<br />To date not a single virus has gotten through or even close to that matter even if you go into the adult section of the web. But be warned if you ignore the warnings Norton gives you, you can unknowingly install a virus, so be smart at where you click.<br />The only place where Norton lacks is the malware section, they need to improve this area.  I have Malwarebytes installed because I know Norton is weak against malware. For $25.00, it is a steal to buy and install.  It works right alongside and not against Norton Security.<br />Easy to add more devices and subscriptions to your account.<br />I like that it scans your downloads and tells you whether or not they are safe and what the reputation of them is.<br />All in all it is a solid product and a must buy for any computer owner. It is great, but can be improved in a few key areas and if they do, it can be amazing for everyone."
0,"It doesn't work, it's absolutely a waste of money.  Do not buy!  I don't usually take the time to write a review, but I feel strongly about this.  Do not waste your money."
0,"his is the WORST software I've EVER USED!!!  Last year, doing my 3 1099's was so easy.  This year, finding \\""Quickemployer forms\\"" is next to impossible.  When I entered the information on one 1099 and was ready to efile, was told I had nothing to efile.  When I went back to the section listing the employees it was not there.  I logged out, logged back in and it was there again.  When I went to finally attempt to efile, it once again said I had nothing to efile.  I kept toggling between last  year and current year and the employee finally showed up. I quickly printed the form and efiled.  I did not receive a confirming message that the efile had taken place, so I have no idea if I've filed or not!  Thought all this might be happening because I was doing it all on the 30th and maybe the system was overloaded.  I attempted to do the same process today...and had the same result for another employee.  This software is JUNK.  Thought buying a pack of 50 forms for 3 employees at $40 was ridiculous. Although in hindsight, it would have been cheaper than spending the hours trying to get this to work.  I certainly hope my new version of Turbo Tax isn't as awful.  Dusty White  Long term Quicken, Quickbooks, and Turbo Tax user...maybe not much longer!"
4,I am very happy to have purchased this product.  It is easy to use and serves me well.  Thank you.
2,A little over my head.....
4,Purchased this software because of the price. The price was $20 lower than other stores and websites. The download was straightforward and easy. Once install it worked like a charm. I would highly recommend it. Especially since you have a history of the downlaod and can re-install it at anytime if necessary.
4,WOW WHAT A BARGAIN AND IT KEEPS YOU SAFE WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO SET ALOT OF STUFF OR WATCHING IT
0,"When I downloaded the virus scan, it came up as a dangerous site."
0,"Update 4/8/15 for Quicken release R5 . 1) The issue about being unable to edit and update Mortgage Accounts has been addressed. This is after Quicken told me that the fact the accounts and tags were unable to be edited was a choice made by Quicken programmers to &#34;improve&#34; the product.   2) The issue that you can't enter negative bills, such as a credit card with a credit balance, something you may want to do to control and balance credit card bills,  has still, after 2 years not been fixed.  3) The issue about investment dividend transactions not updating to next entry date has not been addressed. This problem has cost me an additional two hours of work. A task that used to take 15 to 30 minutes now takes 2 or more hours and requires one to manually track what investment  entries have been updated, what entries have entered, and what entries have had their new dates applied. Again this problem is over two years old.  None of the issues I raised in my review of Quicken 2014 have been addressed.  Quicken is putting out sizzle e.g. Portfolio X-Ray, but the base line functions are getting worse. Qucken 2013 was the last time the issues below had been addressed. Quicken has been aware of these issues for over a year and done nothing, either repairing 2014 or at least fixing them in 2015.  It is not that they are not aware, I contacted Senior Management, they just don't care.. .  1) You can not monitor a credit bill. If you have a credit balance on an account Quicken does not let you manage it as an ongoing bill. It arbitrarily converts a minus of a credit balance to a plus and creates a line item to make the transaction positive. This has NEVER been true in ALL the other versions of Quicken that I have used since around 1995.  2) The redesign of the mortgage function FORCES you to use the Categories that Quicken wants. This means that you have to either correct the transaction after you enter it, or reclassify all of your mortgage entries. You can not use the tagfunction, and again have to touch the transaction to correct it.  3) Investment transactions that are recurring entries do not roll over to their next scheduled date once they are entered."
4,Working great for a travel notebook.
1,I got it and the first thing it did was try to get rid of Webroot. I wanted to keep Webroot so I deleted Norton. It wan't work with another antivirus installed.
4,"As a new user, beginning in August, every time I have needed help, the customer care reps at QBOL have been great.<br />The reporting is most helpful."
4,I have used Quicken for years to keep our personal and farming operation books and love the product.  Recently my Quicken 2008 decided it did not want to open my files anymore so I downloaded Quicken 2012 from Amazon and hoped it would fix the issue.  Luckily it did! I am now back to keeping our our books on this product.  It opened my old files perfectly and I was so relieved!  Couldn't do our taxes without my Quicken!
0,"I have been a Quicken and Quickbook customer for well over 14 years.  This version (Quicken Deluxe 2015) has many problems / glitches and I would not recommend this product until there technical team addresses them.  If you're currently using the 2015 version and all is well, Do not download the software update."
0,Forced to but Deluxe version... then TTax offered $25 refund because of many complaints... Refund had to be applied for AFTER taxes filed - which I did on 4/13...so on 4/22 I attempt to apply for the refund but the site isn't there anymore...BUT in SMALL Print it said the offer expired 4/20.  Customer service was NOT helpful.  (Polite but NOT ABLE to satisfy the customer.)<br />I have been a TTax user for almost 20 years - but if they continue to refuse to do the right thing... I will NEVER purchase this product again!<br />Sincerely disappointed!<br />Thank you TTax for NOTHING!  (re: Expired Refund for Deluxe version)
4,Easy to use!
1,"I had a lot of issues with this software. It was the first time using it and I found it not to be very intuitive. It never made a copy of my returns even when I was prompted to do so (and did). I had to use my hard copy as a resource and actually had to go the the IRS sites to see the status of my refunds. I had an issue with my state return. It wasn't being excepted for some reason so I made an appointment with the nearest H&R Block office to see if they could figure it out. There software was VERY vague as to what the problem was. It had something to do with the disability tax for NYC. It states that what I selected was incorrect but according to the information from the software, I was supposed to select it. When I got there, they new what was wrong but wanted to charge me again to fix it. I walked out very unhappy. In the next 2 days it was finally excepted without me doing anything. I switched to this software because of what I was hearing from Turbo Tax upping their filing price and the user not knowing it till they were ready to file. I will either go back to TT next year or try something else. Defiantly not using H&R Block's software again."
0,"Don't buy this. Very limited and big time waster. Never got it to transfer and I tried Ethernet, Wifi, and USB."
2,"The Quicken 2013 download went fine but I am frustrated with some problems I'm having. I wanted to ensure the Quicken 2013 download was registered to my account. However, despite my having my password, I couldn't find my username. Quicken Tech Support suggested I open a new account which I did but I still don't know how to register my Quicken 2013 download to my new account. Further, when I click Update Transactions, in the past both my checking and savings accounts were downloaded. Now, only the checking account is downloaded. Quicken issues a statement to the effect one account successfully downloaded and one account not successfully downloaded. These problems may have nothing to do with my updating to Quicken 2013 but the bank says it is a Quicken problem. I have the same password for both accounts and that password has not changed."
1,"After buying and downloading the software, I installed it without any problems. I use it to access the laptop, later to access my banks and credit card websites. It works real quick, and it looked like a lot of fun. The specs, on this website, claim it has security against using pictures to log in!<br />Just for the fun of it, I printed a 4x6 color picture of my face (Passport picture) und used it instead of my face. Guess what? I logged in to the &#34;secure&#34; sites above, just as fast as with my face! GREAT SECURITY!!!<br />Now Amazon tells you no refunds....no returns! look at the ad above.<br />Suggestion anyone? I know....uninstall, thanks."
3,Installation was not clean and it took couple of reboots.
1,"My TurboTax returns go back as far as 1998.  The result may not be 100%, but it works well.  That is, the user has to verify.  Our local news channel reported that the 2014 TurboTax software had introduced a significant undisclosed change in pricing.  Thus, a user could purchase what he/she thought was the package used in previous years only to learn after purchase and installation that certain tax forms required upgrades at substantial increases in price.  I certainly have enjoyed the e-filling capability; but with TurboTax's convoluted pricing change I think I will move to H&R Block's software package."
0,I have not used it at all.  I would have returned it for the guarantee but they make the company does not have a number for returns.  They have numbers for everything else but not returns.  There were features that I liked but the import and copy and paste of recipes is horrible.  I am very disappointed and would love to have my money back.
4,This is a great antivirus program.  I have been using the Norton product for a few years and plan to continue.<br />Now they have it available for one device which is exactly what I need for my use.  The price is very reasonable.<br />Downloading and installing the software was very straight forward even for this novice PC user.  I highly recommend purchasing this software.
4,"The download was fast and the installation couldn't be any easier.This is an excellent software for tax preparation, especially if you own and rent out your property.  However, and as good as this software is, I had to manually enter some numbers and information directly on some of the form. I am not sure why the software wouldn't complete the information automatically but at least it leads to where the hiccup is located.<br />Overall, I am very pleased with the results!"
2,"I'm still using Quicken because it is still the best personal finance software out there. I've tested several other fairly well-reviewed titles on the Mac side and nothing has Quicken's depth of features.  I like it so much that I have a virtual machine running on my Mac just so I can run Quicken 2012--it is the only program I use that is PC-based (the Mac version of Quicken is ancient--2007 and virtually unusable now).  The good:  Very deep program.  Manages bank accounts, credit card accounts, mutual funds, stocks, bill paying.  Just about anything you want.  Good user forums and online answers due to the broad customer base out there.  Good integration with Turbo Tax if you complete your own taxes.  The bad:  So many features at this point that it often is very hard to find what you want to do.  Sometimes seems to be impossible.  A good example is setting up 401k accounts.  As a default the program wants to get all your information online and track, for example, all 401k accounts from Fidelity as a group. Not good if you want to manage your 401K investments separately.  You can do this, but it requires a custom setup.  Once you find the button to enter the custom setup it is fine."
4,PLAIN AND SIMPLE. I LOVE IT. THIS VERSION WORKS MUCH BETTER AND FASTER THAN MY OLDER VERSION AND I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT.
2,The software worked well once I got last year's info loaded into it.  I would have rated it higher if it wasn't for their horrible customer support.  I had problems loading last year's info into the app because my business partner did last year's taxes on his computer.  I talked to a support rep to find out how to deal with this.  It took forever for the rep to understand my problem and then the instructions she gave me were absolutely wrong.
4,It's really quiet. And I love it because it has Chinese. That help me a lot.  I think I will keep use it. The only problem is sometime will said my app is virus.
3,"I still use TT because it makes filing taxes easy even when the tax laws are more complicated. Tried others which are also very good but keep coming back to TT. I did use a CPA one year way back sometime and they charged me over $800 so I went back to Home and Business TT and it did the same if not more since then.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the title on Amazon is a bit misleading when it says \\""E-File\\"". It should indicate that it's only for the Federal instead of having to read the fine prints or detail information."
0,This product does not sync with online banking and other accounts. What's the point?
1,The prog. runs very slowly. The display for an account alwasy shows bills to be accepted even when that are no bills listed. Reloading data all the time is very slow. Constaly get msg. &#34;Will not run as Administer&#34; Total process is not nearly as good as the 2013 ver.
3,"It gets the job done, but is not always user-friendly. For example, if you need to edit information already entered, the software sometimes seems to retain parts of the original entry - very frustrating, with nowhere to turn when you cannot find an appropriate category in the on-line help source. Also, the extra charge of $19.99 seems excessive to e-file a state return."
4,It did work perfectly fine!
1,"This looks like a &#34;water downed&#34; version of 2010.  New icons, no background color shading, definitely not up to what I expect from Microsoft.  It appears that at least &#34;Word&#34;, is streaming either to or from &#34;Office&#34;.  I had tech support on the phone and they assured me that the programs are in fact loaded on my machine but I'm not convinced.  It's obvious to me that their pushing their Microsoft Office 365 &#34;rental&#34; software.  Scary!"
3,"I'm very frugal and like to have a plan for my money so this software helps me keep tabs on where it's all going and how often I deviate from &#34;the plan&#34;.  I like that is highly customizable.  I don't like that perhaps it's too customizable.  You could literally bucket every nickle and dime and bury it in a pile of granularity that ultimately renders it worthless.<br /><br />As long as you don't spend 3 weeks setting up all your income/expense categories, you should be good to go.  We use this tool for our household budget and it works great. My wife and I meet monthly to see where our money went and this really has helped to simplify that process.  No more spreadsheets and as-sundry of web pages.  It's click one and done.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs to get better control of their finances or simply like to know where their money is going.  Great product!"
4,Quick & Easy!!
1,"I was hoping this to be better than Roxio creator 2012 but it is just a cheap update and it installs and uses divx, which leaves crap around.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and unless you really like this suite, spring for power2go from cyber link"
3,"The product is fine (I've used it for probably 5 or 6 years) but the software download version from Amazon was out of date (created in October and by mid-February apparently never changed), froze, and could not be updated because the update program thought it was the Premium version (it was not) so couldn't apply the update.  H&R Block gave me a new, already updated version when they couldn't solve the  problem either.  I will buy direct from them after this."
3,"Quicken for MAC 2015 finally has the Quicken capabilities I'm use to with Windows.  The only thing lacking is the retirement planner.  This is easy to use, and very flexible.  I love it."
1,"First,<br />i've used turbotax for years, it's a good product.<br /><br />I chose this rating because every year turbotax gets more and more expensive.  I bought this item called 'TurboTax Deluxe Mac Fed + Efile + State 2013' for $50.  One would expect that to be the only cost you have to incur as it appears to include state.<br /><br />Well, when you get to the end, it throws a $19.99 state efile fee at you.<br /><br />Then a $29.99 refund processing fee.<br /><br />Not a big fan of getting slapped with $50 in fees after I just spent $50 bucks for some software.  This product page doesn't say anything about a refund processing fee or an additional state efile fee.<br /><br />Kinda lame I'm now out $100 to get my refund back.<br /><br />Definitely trying one of the lesser known companies next year as this has left a sour taste in my mouth.  TaxAct time."
2,why are you in this page when this is an old version and they are giving Norton 360 for the same price and it new so ya hahaha
3,This is my second year in a row using H&R Block instead of the other guys and I've been happy with it. I'm on a 100 meg FTTH connection so the download from Amazon was quick. Within about 30 seconds it was installed and about a minute later the latest update was downloaded and installed. In total it took me 20 minutes to do my taxes this year. The only disappointing thing is that my state (Louisiana) taxes will not be available until February 12th.
2,"The version that Amazon sells is 18.0 which has a bug which causes a bunch of script errors when the app. starts. I researched on Nuance's forums and found out that if you call support they will give you a link to download ver. 18.01 which fixes the problem. You will have to have the serial number from the 18.0. Since this is not the current version Nuance does not provide this update on their support site or withing the software update screen that runs the first time the program is run. Still, once this hassle is gone through the program seems to work OK and it is a whole lot cheaper than the current version, which is $99.  I asked Nuance support why Amazon is still selling this version and they said they didn't have any control over it. Whatever, be forewarned."
1,"For those who like to keep up with the latest bells and whistles, I am sure this program works well.  For some of us we do not need or want all the stock quotes and cell phone access. I just want to keep track of bank accounts and pay bills.  I had to upgrade because my old version was no longer going to work past April 2013.  Now that I have a newer version, my computer also needs more memory ( the old version worked fine).  I don't know if there are sections that I can unload and still have the program work.  I don't like that I have to buy more than I want in this program."
4,"I use AVG antivirus and lie it but my system was slower than normal, after installing AVG tune up and performing directed cleanup, system was faster on startup, shutdown, and overall performance"
3,I use it a lot and I like it....Rich
2,"This product is definitely inferior to the Windows version.  The conversion process did not work properly and I had to send my file to Intuit to convert it properly.  I find it awkward to use, but this may be due to it being so different than the other version."
3,I wish I had a hard copy because I lost it on my computer when my hard drive crashed.  I was not able to download it again!
4,Love Norton
1,"I am really upset with Quicken. I have owned Quicken software for a long time. My current version is Quicken Deluxe 2012, which I bought new less than a year ago. I was trying to reinstall it on a new computer, but the setup program failed to work. When I called Quicken for help with their defective disk, I was told that they support only the 2013 version and if I wanted help, I'd have to upgrade or pay them. Quicken makes a lot of money on this program, especially when they come out with a new version practically every year. Yet they refuse to support even the last incarnation of their product. In view of their arrogant customer service policies, I imagine a lot of users are seriously considering finding an alternative. What have we done for them lately? What have they done for us?"
0,"Free is a very expensive proposition when it comes to the mechanics of this program. If you are just trying to make a grocery list with one word and no photos, this is yours. However if you are attempting to write a detailed manuscript, be prepared for a roller coaster ride through hell. I couldn't afford to keep using this free software, may I suggest hiring two monks to scribe your work or a number two pencil and a scrap of a paper bag to create your documents."
3,Works well but someone stole my laptop and of course I'll have to buy the product again even though I only used it for a few months
0,"I have been using this program after Microsoft Money was discontinued. I started with Quicken 2010 which was a decent product. Not great but it did the job. Quicken sends me a message that I have to upgrade to 2013 or I won't be able to download quotes after April 2013. So I figure I would do the upgrade since its been about 3 years since I bought 2010. Oh boy do I regret that! First the portfolio scrolling is even worse than 2010. It is really cluncky when using the keyboard, so I am forced to use the scroll bars. The worst thing is the program crashes often. Especially when updating the live account updates.  The program freezes which forced me to abort the program. When I reopened it my entire investment portfolio is corrupted. Also this program still doesn't calculate portfolio returns correctly. Thank god I backed before doing my monthly updates, but I still lost hours of reconciling worked. If you are an existing Quicken user stay away from this upgrade as long as you can. Shame on Intuit for this crappy product!"
0,sorry never downloaded it after I read that you have to pay and it is not free as advertised
4,"Voice reader software makes being a full time English Student that has to read 3 novels a week easily manageable.  Every Literary student should have this.  Not only does it read what you place into the document, it allows you to convert your readings into MP3's so I can do my homework through out the day is incredibly useful.  South Asian diasporic literature has never been this easy!<br /><br />The conversion settings are a little tricky to understand at first, but I recommend setting your recordings to not exceed 10 minutes.  This way each &#34;Track&#34; of audio only takes 3-5 minutes, and you can test them to make sure everything's fine.  Also, that makes it easier to keep track if you're doing stuff and need to jump a little because you got distracted or fell asleep listening to something like Jane Austin."
0,"I used AVG for several years on my old laptop running XP and it did the job perfectly. When I bought a new Win7 machine I promptly bought AVG Internet Security 2013. In the course of the next 3 months, this software has rendered my machine useless 3 different times, each after an \\""update\\"" download. The symptom is that I cannot access the internet until I uninstall AVG and then re-install. Normal windows control panel uninstall? No! A two part uninstall: first uninstall from windows control panel, second download the special AVG uninstaller from their website and run it (because if I re-install AVG now the problem recurs), third re-install AVG security, fourth call technical support (because I still can't access internet after reinstalling) - several times and hope I'll get a tech that knows the tricks to completely clean up the mess this process has made on my computer (this did happen - the quick fix via dos command line trickery - on support call #3 the first instance of \\""AVG lockup\\"" but I couldn't find someone who knew how to do that even with 4 phone calls the second time this happened a month later) .  The second time this happened, they wanted to charge me by the hour to fix the fact that their software had hosed my computer. They finally consented to help me via email and had me running diagnostic programs and emailing them the results so they could (hopefully) debug the problem. Eventually one of the reinstall attempts worked.  Now it's happened for a third time. I don't have hours to waste on their support process and days to wait until my computer is fixed, especially when the software is free or fairly inexpensive from some other company. Goodbye (forever) AVG!"
1,"Has anyone noticed how Quicken 2013 sucks compared to previous versions. I've been a quicken user for many years and the performance has steadily gone downhill, not to mention the non-intuitive nature of the user interface (wasn't that where Intuit came from). I would rather have fewer bells and whistles than have to wait interminably while Quicken makes me select lots for my mutual fund transactions, etc. etc. etc. If there was a comparable program out there I would switch to it, but I guess Intuit has got the corner on the market. I wonder where the programming is done? I'll bet it's not in the US anymore."
1,I had originally purchased this Quicken product in 2010.  I now purchased a new computer and couldn't seem to download it again so I purchased it again.  I cannot get this new product to download either.  I have the files moved to this computer already but neeed the program.  Can you help?
3,So far this seems to be everything I expected it would be. It was simple to download and works just fine
0,The &#34;actors&#34; in this online class are european (not hawaiian) and it's obvious they are mouthing the words while someone else speaks.  It's really distracting and annoying.  And the language learning techniques they have are not that great.  It's ok but I wouldn't recommend it.
0,"I've been using this software for about 10 years.  I know it's not the best tax software out there, it constantly gets subpar reviews, but by golly it should at least be able to seemlessly import last year's data, right? So it's the cheapest for a Personal+Business package and I've come to accept you get what you pay for.<br /><br />But, the marriage is over.  Like each year, the personal software is passable, and the business is just rotten. It looks like it's gotten almost no user interface update in the past 10 years.  My gripe list this year about HRBlock Business.<br />- DID NOT import most information for my business (partnership) taxes, only imported the depreciation schedule (thank dog for that much)<br />- Did not copy my partner's information back from K1s to correct forms on 1065. Until I manually added, then two copies of each of us showed up when I printed it. ARGH!<br />- 3 Warnings/Errors were completely unrelated to anything I needed to fill out but were impossible to clear. Finally just finished with warnings.<br />- took forever to figure out to transition from Fed to State<br />- Took yet another forever to figure out how to download additional State forms.  Seriously.  Did anybody even test this software!!<br />- Printed a dog-gone ream of paper.  I swear these guys are in bed with the Paper cartels.  Why would you print EVERY. EFFIN. Schedule which had nothing to do with my return.  My &#34;don't file&#34; pile is about 3X taller then the pages the G-Men are actually getting.<br />- My State requires me to include my Fed Form. You even asked me about that.  Did you happen to print a second copy of the State for me?  Oh wait, it's got a big ole' CLIENT COPY WATERMARK on it.  My printer's Smoking by this point, but may as well print some more.<br /><br />Why does this have to be so complicated?  I guess next year I'll try the ole' Turbo Tax business and see if it's any better..."
3,good
2,"When I purchased this TaxAct, I thought this was for 2012 - my bad should have paid more attention when purchasing."
0,"Bitdefender is the worst experience I have ever had with a company and a piece of software. This company is full of cheats.    THEY CHEAT IN THEIR RATINGS (probably by paying the editors who rate them).  Just check out the user ratings (versus the editor ratings) on every website that claims they are the best (and actually has user ratings.  CNET for example). I cannot believe that editors are that out of touch with their constituents.  The only people who will benefit from Bitdefender software are people who don't know how to use their computer.  Because Bit-defender has lots of superficial \\""features\\""  that are made for just these people (who don't know better).    THEY LIE IN THEIR ADS about ease of use.  I saw their \\""one click\\"" ad somewhere touting you could do almost anything with one click.  Whatever...  The only thing you can do with one click is a basic scan or securely erase files (which can be done with ANY decent antivirus program).  Anyone who KNOWS what they are doing and has used and configured their antivirus settings before will have one HELL of a time trying to find those same settings in this software.  (Some of them don't exist).  Bitdefender has done their best to make their product as convoluted as possible so that you are cowed into using their default settings before realizing that some of those settings are actually missing. (Hence discovering you have bought an inferior product).    They also cheat people out of money.  I opened an issue 8 days after I purchased Bitdefender 2014 (See comments below for Version 2015) because I already had issues with the lack of control I had over what to do when a virus is discovered.  Twenty three days later they had not resolved my issue and I had more issues.  I decided I wanted my money back and they refused to do it because I was asking 1 day after the 30 day deadline even though I had an open, unresolved issue.    So I have been forced to use a piece of software and deal with a company I cannot stand.I recently had to reinstall my OS because of what was likely a boot sector virus that this piece of crap did not detect.  I LOST ALL MY PROGRAMMING CODE FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS.  Including the backups because the computer would not even boot from a regular windows CD with the drive attached.  Luckily, I know my way around such issues and was able to retrieve it by booting a special utility CD and deleting the partition that was infected (C:).  Of course when I finally had a new drive and a new C: partition with an OS installed, I could not find the download for my original version of Bitdefender.  They had no directions on their website on how to recover the edition you purchased.  I had to find instructions on a third party website that said to just download the most current version... that my older license would work with it.  So I did.  I have already given more time than this piece of feces deserves so I will just say this.  VERSION 2015's INTERFACE IS WORSE (MORE CONVOLUTED) THAN 2014.  But at least they got rid of the completely random log-in nag from version 2014."
1,"I should have known better than to &#34;upgrade&#34; to Quicken 2014 in February....it has plenty of problems as other reviewers point out.  The most annoying is the oversize register and teeny tiny font in the Accounts list. There is not way to adjust the size or width of register columns, and the font size can only be between 8 and 12.  I am obliged to use a obscure font that someone mentioned in an online forum.  Intuit...you have lost a customer for future updates."
1,Upgraded to Quicken 2013 after being told that new version corrected issue of not being able to print envelopes from address book. It wasn't fixed. There are pages and pages of complaints on the Quicken website . All answers say that they are working on it. Of course that means they have been working on it for at least a year and half.
0,This company is based in Moscow and governed by the laws of Russia.  I believe that this fact leaves Americans open to abuse.  Why would you want your passwords and internet security housed on a server in Russia?  It makes no sense to me.  Given the general state of corruption that exists there... I choose to use a different company.
0,It should not say it comes with one free state refund if it does not. When you get to the end it ask you to either provide a credit card to pay $20 or pay out of your refund for $50. Buyer beware.
2,"Program was exactly as hoped and appeared to find a couple of things the previous virus software let slip through.  However, overhead was significant and bogged the computer down on a regular basis, just performing its background tasks.  Older CPU (Pentium 4), so a newer CPU and more RAM may have handled better.  Not sure I can recommend for an older computer though."
4,Works as advertised.
1,It downgrades FM radio recordings to 191k/bs.
4,Just what every stupid taxpayer needs
1,The product itself is great but I have had many problems with the key code. It keeps expiring even though I just installed it. I've had to call customer service a couple times for a new code and continue to have problems.
1,"I'm a  fan of Quicken, but really disappointed in this version.  As others have mentioned, the performance of this program is unacceptable.  The screen refresh is very slow and unresponsive when scrolling large sets of data (for example in the budget).  There is nothing visually going on here that should warrant this type of sluggishness.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the QA process is like at Intuit, but there is no excuse for this product to make it out of QA in it's current state.  As is, it's an exercise in frustration to do anything other than basic ledger entry.<br /><br />I'm disappointed that these comments seem to have gone on for a few months now and nothing has been done to address the issue yet in the 5 updates released this far.  The performance and user experience issues that result should be the top priority above all else, in my opinion.<br /><br />Let's get it together, Intuit, and get these issues addressed asap."
1,"I was surprised when I did my taxes and found that the package I bought did not come with the state tax without paying for it.  In the past 8 years I've been using turbo tax, I've never had to pay extra for filing a state return.  I not only had to pay $39.99 for one state but two, since I work and live in 2 different states.  This costs me almost $80 more.  In addition, I also had to purchase Form C which cost me another $30.  I used the same form last year and it was included in the Turbo Tax software package I purchased."
0,"The software may be fine but this year's shuffling of features to drive some of us up to the next level is disappointing.  I stayed with TurboTax this year (started with them many years ago) because of particular tax circumstances, but came very close to going to Block.  May go that way next year."
1,"I like many have been a Quicken user for many years.  My tendency has been to upgrade every 2 or 3 years just because the versions only changed slight (not enough to warrant paying $50+ a year for).  We haven't used Quicken for a few years and decided to go back to using it to keep track of our financial lives.<br /><br />The mobile sync is the reason we went ahead and purchased this release.  The wife and I miss the days of using Pocket Quicken and syncing information back to the PC in the house so that we could keep track of what we were doing outside the home.  With both of us now carrying smartphones and tablets, the new way of sync'ing seem to fit what we missed.<br /><br />But, it has been a major issue.  Not from having issues with duplicate transactions or split transactions being deleted or corrupted.  I can get the mobile sync to work at all.  I've just spent an hour on the phone with support (if you can call it support since Intuit is using folks out of India), and got no where.  All I was trying to do was sync a couple of bank accounts and a cash account.  The cash account worked fine.  Tried to add a couple of bank accounts and Quicken would stop responding.  Support had me going in a scripted circle of validating the data file, removing the cloud account, adding accounts back in.  The last step was to remove the cash account since accounts are suppose to be linked to a bank account.  Really?!?<br /><br />I'm very disappointed in this release.  Intuit should have done a better job of making sure the mobile sync function was working before releasing this product.  Looks like someone said \\""Screw whether or not it works.  We have a deadline to meet!\\"""
2,"I've been using H&R Block (TaxCut) software for at least four years. It's nice to be able to import info from year to year. I've never had any issues with installation, updates or crashes.<br /><br />This year I almost bought TurboTax, but some forms I needed were in one version but not another and vice versa. I went with this version thinking it would have more than I needed. Unfortunately it doesn't include the forms related to the electric vehicle purchase or charger installation tax credit. I'll have to download the forms and mail them in. No e-filing this year.<br /><br />Other than this minor issue that won't affect most people, I would still recommend it. As others mentioned, they may be slow to make program updates, but I've been waiting for paperwork and haven't really noticed."
1,I have used Turbo Tax for years The 2014 version is a mess!! One example: the program asked for the date I died. I could not correct it.
0,"I hate everything about this product. Couldn't download it to begin with, no product key was given and it's by sheer luck I figured out that I could try to re-open the appropriate page using my Amazon receipt. I HATE the look of everything Microsoft has created this year, and this product is no exception. It's a Windows 8 product, and it looks blocky, brightly colored, and like something a child would design. I hate it and I wish I'd bought the 2010 version. I'm going to do my damnedest to get a refund."
2,I couldn't get the game to save so every time I got off i had to start all over again.<br />I was very annoying. the levels themselves were challenging which was good.<br />It was fun once I got past the fact I had to sit there for most of the day playing to keep my progress.<br />the game would be five stars. but it was the not saving factoid that made me give it three.
4,"It's one of the fastest and lowest impact anti-virus programs available, and scores very well on catching viruses and malware. The user interface is good, and it includes a feature that will warn you if various other programs are out of date and offer to update them for you. Avast is arguably the best free anti-virus program available, although Avira is a strong challenger for that title. It's better than many of the commercial programs for Windows.<br /><br />If you're short on RAM, you might be better off with a recent version of Symantec/Norton Anti-virus. But for everyone else, I highly recommend Avast."
2,Had a bigger learning curve than I expected
0,Not useful to me
3,Boost my kindle
1,Frequent pop-ups<br />I continue to get pop-ups wanting me to buy an AVG maintenance package for the program that I already purchased.
1,"During driving the Garmin makes lots of random comments.....  Also, the default voice identifies the road in which you are turning, this does not.  It simply says turn left or right....  Taking it off my Garmin and putting on the default voice....  Very disappointed!!!"
0,"I have QB 2012 just received a notice that they will no longer be supporting 2012 payroll assistance. Yes they say the program will still work but even though they have recently raised their monthly payroll fees they still want more. This latest effort is obviously a ploy to attempt to get users to upgrade to what appears to be a crappy 2015 program.  Quite frankly Intuit needs a some stiff competition to get them off there high horse and back to giving customer service like they did years ago when they first started. I've been using their programs since the 80s but all I've seen is them going down hill ever since. I may start looking for other alternatives for handling my payroll and books. I'd love to have a program that allows me to print reports. Quickbooks stopped recognizing my printers and I gave up trying to figure that one out. Why do they have to have their own printer setup unlike any other software. Please, give us a break and get your act together and don't bother to write a canned answer to my comments."
3,"I haven't really looked at what's new with settings options, compared to last year's Norton program, however there is one thing that's new that I think is neat.  A little flag alert appears when your CPU is struggling a bit with too much activity.  I tend to have a lot of windows/processes going at once, and all too often suffer a computer stall/freeze as a result.  When this visual alert appears, I take it as a cue to close any un-needed windows - haven't suffered a computer stall once since using this program!<br /><br />Another comment - kind of a gripe - I wish that purchasing a renewal from Amazon was communicated to Norton!  I'm still getting e-nags from Symantec to renew because they don't know that I have...<br /><br />And also, like everything else, I guess... the price has gone up~  What are you going to do though...you have to have it."
1,"I guess I'm one of the lucky ones in that the removal of Schedule D from TT Deluxe won't affect me this year. However, next year, if Inuit hasn't seen the error of its ways, I'll be buying an alternative product from another vendor."
4,easy to use v. photo shop - - - requires some setup of libraries and folders - - all in all eccellent
1,"Purchased this and found it to be a disappointment primarily because unlike most accounting software, you cannot make a journal entry in Quicken.<br /><br />I would encourage anyone interested in keeping accrual based business, to look for alternatives."
3,Didn't read fine print.  This was the cloud version.  I prefer to have it loaded on the computer.  Slow.
3,"Basic Microsoft product with the usual quirks and failures.  Works generally the same on Mac as on a PC.  Not a really great product, but then they don't have to make it that way since it's basically the only game in town."
3,"Easy to download, install and run."
0,"This review is concerning the Download Version of the product:    I am using the software for several years now and this year I decided to test the business package as well. The installation of the Home Premium portion worked just fine. (Under Windows 7 Ultimate - 32bit).     Suggestion: The readme.txt file could be updated in accordance to the proper names to be found within the setup folder. (Not a major issue but it shows the lack of care in this area.)    Then the attempt to install the Home Business 2009 portion of the package. I tried all kinds of ways to get this done successfully, by double-clicking, by running as admin, after cleaning the local temp folder prior of running the executable.     Result: It never does complete. The \\""Installing Setup Files\\"" message box stays on the screen forever. The windows task manager shows a running application but that is as far as it goes.    Conclusion:    How good is a software when you can't even finish the installation routine successfully?? I think that speaks for itself.    I will try to find a solution for this problem within the next couple days, but without any error message logged in the event log, that is going to be a bit of a challenge.    Current state:    The business part of the program is useless for me.    Did anyone out there make similar experience with the exact same installer under Windows 7?"
0,"Kaspersky make it impossible to stop renew... took 3 calls and 45 minutes.  Do business with a real company.  Emails have fake links, no easy way to contact company."
4,Good product at a good price
3,"I am using Windows XP Professional.  The software worked good.  I am able to save it as PDF very easily and print.  I don't understand how some reviewers have complained that they cannot save in PDF.  It is better to save as PDF and then print instead of directly printing because with PDF you can review your final output on the screen.    I know what I am filing and the numbers I am going to enter, hence it may have been easy to use the software.  Also I am a technical person.  But still, the program was quite robust.      Overall, I am happy with it.  This is the first time I am using it."
0,"Not good at all. It seems to have been built by people who are not property managers. The software should adjust to the need of the manager through \\""settings\\"" with a lot of choices as properties and managers have different needs. I'm not using this software any more; a waste of money. I am very unhappy for not being able to get my money back."
3,Its ok!
3,cheap not bad
2,It is frustrating when you save and then open TurboTax later and it takes you back to the beginning and walks you through everything you have already completed.
3,"great, thanks"
3,Great product at a very good price.  No issues with purchase or shipment.  Thank you for offering this product at a great price.
4,"Top notch antivirus and in my humble view, the best there is! I've been using it now for 2 years."
1,"I was disappointed to see that I was overbilled on my charge card and then again when I saw that the software installed, but there was no option for saving a back-up copy if something goes wrong with the original.  Finally, I never did receive a \\""confirmation e-mail\\"".  For the price, opt for the actual TT CD package."
4,Still the best.
0,"I have used TurboTax Deluxe for eleven years without complaint and with full satisfaction. NO MORE! Intuit found a way to take  a winner and turn it into a platinum loser with the 2014 version! First, they cheapened the Software by eliminating specific forms and guidance tools. You don't find out that the Deluxe Version is inadequate for your needs (eg., lack of K-1 and Schedule D Forms, etc ) until you're midway through Tax Preparation; suddenly you are advised that you are required to upgrade to the Premiere Version and must pay and additional $30. Oh yes, Intuit came clean AFTER THE FACT and offered some rebates. Intuit also made it possible for Deluxe Buyers to get a free upgrade to Premiere. That process added insult to injury. You must call them while in the middle of your Tax Preparation(and go through an Easter Egg Hunt to find the correct phone number); then when you get to the warning page(stating upgrade required) you need to wait on hold for a lengthy amount of time(because there are so many confused and irritated customers on hold) and then when a service representative responds, you are asked for your product serial number. This info is buried in the &#34;warning&#34; page links and none of the service reps seem to know this. If you don't have the serial number, they won't authorize the upgrade or send you the required link. After being put on hold for ten more minutes, I terminated the call, fished through the page links, and found my product serial number. I then had to call again, stay on hold almost forever and repeat my entire issue to another apologetic Rep, to get the elusive, required upgrade link. So for 2014, if you want to take the road to hell, you must first make a stop at TurboTax Deluxe!"
2,only let me use it for a 30 day trial
2,"If you have the newest system Maverick OS X on your mac computers, this security software is not compatible with it. It was my fault that I did not look at the system requirements to see if it was compatible with my mac system."
2,IRS rejected my federal e-file return the first time due to a software error.  Price of $22 was good.
3,"This program pretty much explains itself.  Does what it supposed to though sometimes you will have delays when opening Word and other programs, other than that its great!"
2,This product seems to work as advertised but the price increase from last year is too great. Next year I will look at alternatives.
0,"I have been using Quicken for many years and I usually upgrade every 3 years.  I look forward to working with a new version and seeing all of the updates and improvements.  However, I am having so many problems with Quicken 2015!!!  There are so many bugs!  I have wasted so much time trying to figure out how to solve the problems.  I am seriously thinking of looking for a another product."
1,"I never have a chance to download the item, it keeps asking to purchase another code. And when it goes to Symantec website setup, it becomes more complicated. I will not purchase again."
4,"After trying SiteSpinner, also purchased on Amazon.com, which I just hated, I decided to give this a try. Download feature direct from Amazon was a plus. Easy to use, has all the bells and whistles you need for a modern website. Very similar to Microsoft Publisher in its structure. Great price-point, should actually be a little more in my opinion. Software checks for updates at start-up. I built a rather large site in less than a month and have had nothing but rave reviews. Includes forms, social media share functions, picture galleries, practically everything you need for a professional commercial website."
0,"After loading this 4 times I cannot get past the startup screen with a crash, have to un-install and re-install 2013 to get functionality back.<br /><br />I do not recommend product, I've sent their little error reports, one would think they might send me an email trying to help but nope, nothing.<br /><br />I want my money back."
3,"Again, for the 2nd year I have had to upgrade within Intuit to the Premier product (another $32.00 because this version doesn't handle my small ($125) stock dividend. What is wrong with Intuit???? I've used this version for years and now they have dropped a form and you need to upgrade."
4,Let me make this very clear.  It's awesome!  Enough said.  No need to nit and pick over stupid stuff.  This really WORKS!
0,"I have used Quicken for many years, however, this program is causing problems when Windows does an update. I have had to reload from backup each time. I don't understand where the conflict is coming from. Until I can resolve this problem I cannot fairly rate the product"
0,The Activation Code that comes with the CD does not work does not work.
1,"I've been a happy Quicken user since 2000, and I've frequently upgraded.  I'm guessing I've now had 8 different Quicken versions over this time.    I'm a heavy user, with lots of transactions and accounts, and I'm also a member of Quicken's Inner Circle.    I'm sad to report that this year's Q2012 Premier is the worst version I've encountered.    I've been victim to countless crashes, inexplicable endless hangs, problems with accepting downloaded transactions, etc.  At least one of this year's \\""updates\\"" has made things even worse (in Accepting Downloaded Transactions).    All of this has been a great surprise and disappointment because until this version I've been a big fan.    At first I wondered if perhaps I might've recently exceeded a Quicken capacity limit, but the Quicken URL that mentions this ([...]) states \\""Transactions, reports, and graphs - As many as allowed by the size of your hard drive\\"".  I have a 1T hard drive that's under 10% full so the problem is not at my end.    I do plan to continue with Quicken since so far I can't find a similar alternative that can export data into a tax program, but from now on I will downgrade to Quicken Deluxe, and rely on my broker sites to handle my investment transactions."
1,very tricky and difficult to install
4,"how do i download to 5 different machines? i can see how one gets downloaded, but how do i transfer to my other machines. thanks."
3,"very smooth, without a hitch. The effort is none and does not make me cringe at next April. Will use again"
1,"It took over 24 straight hours for PCmover to copy files to my new laptop; in the end, the only usable programs were ones I could have downloaded in a few minutes on my own (e.g., Firefox), and I still had to transfer all of my documents and data files using flash drives. (Maybe these details were spelled out somewhere, but I didn't see them.) I would suggest that potential buyers save their money and transfer their programs and files without purchasing this software. I wish I had."
1,It did not come with Outlook.  Should have purchased the &#34;older&#34; version.  Ultimately I went and subscribed to Office 365.  You can tell there is still a war between Microsoft and Apple though.  The mail merge feature in Word for Mac is very cumbersome and confusing to use versus the more (but not much more) intuitive version for PCs.
3,I use it each year but when a decent competitor comes along I will probably try something new unless the price goes down.
3,Got verified easily. The product works fine.
0,Another £15 down the drain! Grimefighter did not work - I kept getting messages &#34;cannot connect to Internect&#34; and finally &#34;Grimefighter unable to work on your computer&#34;. There is nothing wrong with my computer OS Windows 8.1 and my wireless internet connection works just fine. So far I have not found a way to contact them withing paying out even more money and I am annoyed that they can sell you a useless program and get away with it. A word of comfort to those who got done like me: perhaps it is a blessing in disguise!! Our computers could have been adversely affected by this obscure program.
2,"After installing it asked me for a customer ID and password to install the state module.  I didn't have a customer ID or password...  Once I closed the install state dialog box it asked me to register, after completing registration they emailed me the customer ID and password needed.<br /><br />TaxAct: maybe prompt users to register before asking for a username and password they don't have.<br /><br />More details to follow..."
1,"I had a 10+ year old version that, as part of Microsoft Works, won't install on W7.  I purchased this thinking it would be newer and better and am very disappointed with the maps.  Yes, they added some bells and whistles to the program but their maps still stink.  They are no different than the old version which lacks many roads unless you zoom way in and, even then, they still miss roads.  I have a version of Simply Streets by DeLorme that I paid $10 for some 15 years ago that has better maps - even showing back-country dirt roads! Now I am sorry that I didn't think to go to DeLorme's web site to see what they had in the way of a full featured map program.  Microsoft's Streets and Trip team should spend more time on accurate maps that show secondary and tertiary roads without having to zoom in to the point that you lose sight of where you are."
1,"Ok product for the small do-it-yourself bookkeeper, not for businesses that use professional services. Though it is more convenient because of the online access, it is still not equal to the full version."
3,Works fine
2,how to get the new 3-D picture pro and download
4,Must to have.
3,"The Anytime Upgrade is a painless way to upgrade the Windows 7 Home Premium to Ultimate. On the two boxes I've upgraded it took perhaps ten minutes to complete the process. The upgrade is not cheap, so why bother? There are only a few additional features that Ultimate adds to Home Premium. The feature that I wanted isn't even mentioned anywhere that I've looked: Windows Media Center gets a drag-able slider for TV recordings with a small window showing the content at the slider's position. This works exactly like the slider in the Netflix streaming viewer. It's easy to use the slider to find where a TV program resumes after the ads, so I don't have to us Media Center's clumsy two-speed fast forward control (which is too slow or too fast)."
0,This version didn't work on my system.  So was a waste of money for me personally.
2,So Far I like the previous version. I have a little print size work to do on the new version. It works fairly well with my bank transactions but I must make the new version print size more readable.
1,"The only reason I upgraded was that Quicken 2011 online functionality will stop working. I see no improvements in 2014 over 2011 and instead several new annoying bugs. This is with the most recent R5 update. For instance, it is impossible to click on the blue dot next to freshly downloaded transactions to Mark as Reviewed, due to a popup message that instead appears. On one of my computers, the cursor blinks wildly while updating, making every operation take 10x the amount of time needed. One of my account online updates works only once, then I have to Deactivate and Reactivate to get it to work again."
3,"I have been looking to upgrade to Home & Business, and was force to when my Quicken 2010 informed me that downloads would stop at the end of March."
0,"I need one line of Schedule D.  I'm not buying.<br />And what does this word &#34;Deluxe&#34; mean?<br /><br />I read most of the reviews.  Bob Meighan, VP TurboTax, appears to have found steady work.<br /><br />Thanks for wasting my time, Intuit!"
4,works<br /> enough said
0,"Make sure your school will work before you purchase this. They will NOT refund your money or give you the SERIAL NUMBER if you are rejected. I thought for sure my online school would be fine it wasn't and so I am stuck with an unusable download because i have no serial number. I was told that adobe would give me a refund within 30 days, so i tried and they said they needed the serial number in order to give me a refund!!! LOL How in the hell do I give them a serial number when they are the ones refusing to give me the serial number!!! I would not be trying to get my money back if I had the serial number!!! duh"
4,"Wow. I only use one function, an encrypted virtual drive for my sensitive files, and it's great! You get 5 computers on the license and am using it on 2 laptops and a workstation. EASY, no hiccups, works great. I've used several encryption programs (yes DriveCrypt is great, but costs $200). Had this for a couple months and couldn't be happier. Using on Windows 7 & 8.1.<br /><br />Maybe I'll try the other things soon, like Portable Safe (for USB thumb drives, I hope)."
0,i have been using this program for seven or eight years with no issues. This year they managed to screw up everything. I got through my tax forms but had a problem filing my state return online so I called the customer service number. I was on the phone for more than two hours and the issue wasn't resolved - i ended up having to mail the state return.
4,Switched from Turbo Tax and found that this product worked perfectly.
1,"My 2014 Quicken works good except it will not let me go online.  I have quicken checking program and when I try to go online and send checks, It bombs the program back to my desk top.  The same for trying to update my checking account from my bank.<br />Help.<br />Gary Lundquist"
2,"First - the product works as advertised - your returns get completed and accepted by the Feds.<br /><br />But - prepared to be \\""nickle and dimed\\"" at every turn.  This program is asking for more money to actually file the returns or for some other reason all the time.  The initial purchase price is just the start, count on doubling the price once you are finally finished.<br /><br />And be aware that TurboTax does not upgrade their program from year-to-year!  Whatever you buy this year, you get to throw it away and you have to buy everything all over again for next year."
0,"I couldn't do anything and a hi-tech son couldn't either, though he spent a lot of time trying. It trimmed the size of the pictures in the movie strip.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Corel owns them. Their service representative did not know what Toast is. Neither could he follow up and find someone who knows about Toast. Automatic email responses sent me to Corel Draw and its ilk.<br /><br />I removed it from my Mac and threw the CD in the trash. Would that I could get my money back."
3,"The price has jumped from $9.95 to $49.95. Why is that? I just brought it 3 weeks ago for $9.95. Now Amazon sell it for $49.95. And the price change weekly. It's almost 2012. The price should drop it to $4.99, because 2012 is already released!"
2,I have bee using Turbo Tax for over 6 years.  This year... I am NOT impressed!  I had more difficulty this year than ever before with Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014 Fed & State.  Fed was not that bad... but State was a mess!!! I file non-resident NC & &#34;SHOULD&#34; have gotten a refund as I have for all past years. But I got so frustrated with the UNCLEAR instructions that I just went with what Turbo Tax did (which was break even... nothing owed & no refund) & just went ahead & sent it in so I would not be late in filing my return. I can only PRAY that  NC Dept of Revenue catches the error & issues me my refund any way.<br />I don't know what went wrong with your product OR if there have been some changes to NC 2014 Tax regulations (which I doubt) but &#34;I know for certain&#34; I should have gotten a refund from the state of NC.  This is going to cause me to question using Turbo Tax in the future.
0,"I had been a happy user of Printmaster Premier v7.0 until I had to replace my computer. As with so many other programs, that version of Printmaster is not supported by Windows 8. Because of my previous satisfaction with Printmaster, I bought this program in the Download version, and tried to use it. I say &#34;tried&#34;, because I gave up in frustration when I couldn't even design a label for jam jars. The program tries to steer you into using their templates, and seems limited in options for creating things from scratch. I'm sorry I bought it, and I won&#34;t recommend it to anyone."
1,"I downloaded this poduct.  I am sorry that I purchased it.  You don't get a written manual on how to use it and I could not find one online to purchase.  All the sample pictures or whatever is all coded numbers.  If you want &#34;flowers&#34;  you have to click on each one of the codes and that takes a long time  There are no words to let you know where you are with anything.  If anyone has an idea of how to use this product, please post it.  Looks like a nice product other than that so I rated it very low as I am unable to figure this out at this time."
2,I have had quicken for years and was once again required to update my version because of the threat of lack of support and download ability.  I have had minor problems for years that I have managed to work around more or less.  This time the 2014 version is a real pain.  I waited until the last minute in hopes that the bugs the other reviewers had mention would have been worked out....They have not.  It is extremely irritating that the program can't even enter a managed reminder transaction when I want it to.  Stupid.  Quicken used to be a fantastic program that certainly had some bugs that the support staff would work out.  It has gone downhill.  Any support you get now is from other users that intuit posts on their site.  I will continue to use it as (1) I have already purchased it. (2) my banks will download to it. (3) my spouse is &#34;new program weary&#34;.  However I will continue to look for a new program that is as versatile as quicken used to be.  What a shame.  I WANT to like it.
4,"2014 new download of product, great price and great product. Don't be afraid to buy this,its set and forget it."
0,"We have used a hand-built Excel spreadsheet to track self-employment I&E for several years. Quicken H&B was supposed to be an upgrade, yet we'll be returning to the spreadsheet since it has far fewer bugs than this junk. Not only that, I can actually print from the spreadsheet. Quicken, on the other hand, crashes when you try to print, and it does something funky to the PC's security ID while crashing (Amazon: &#34;This is a new device. Please enter your ZIP code,&#34; on the only PC I've used to visit their site during the past year.) What the heck good is personal-finance software that can't even print reports for tax time?<br /><br />I've spent three hours going through all the troubleshooting tips on the support site in an effort to get this working right, to no avail. When the best advice Intuit can come up with is uninstalling and re-installing existing printer drivers as a workaround, they really need to take that as a hint that they're doing it all wrong. I'm not wasting any more time with chat when &#34;blame everybody else's bugs&#34; is the best answer Intuit can come up with in its self-service support. We know this is inexpensive, mass-market software, folks, but self-help really ought to be a lot more straightforward than this.<br /><br />I'd choose zero stars if Amazon offered the option. If you really feel like wasting 75 bucks, burn it instead of buying this. At least you'll be able to warm your hands for a few seconds. Yes, H&B 2015 is THAT useless."
1,Was not what i needed
1,The business program wasn't as  easy to  work with and  I had to  re-install it  several  times caused it  crashed and  the  program  kept giving me  different  error  issues
3,I haven't really had any problems with the desktop download.  it seems to be working properly and doing what its supposed to do.  i know i don't use a lot of space but still seems to be an awesome app.
1,"I'm a fan of Corel, since I purchased CorelDraw 3.0.<br />I decided to use this product as my main home video projects.<br />but after installing and doing some small videos, VideoStudio X6 crashed several times.<br />on top of that, I got this message: &#34;Error: 38 - Corel Video Studio files have been damaged or modified. Please reinstall your original source.&#34; Enough! I will not reinstall, I will go after Premiere Elements, while waiting Corel release VideoStudio X7 and I hope to get a discount for this X6 failure."
1,"I'm trying to learn German and Hungarian in order to speak to relatives overseas without Google Translate and 2 dictionaries.  I purchased this thinking it would help me with the basics... and uninstalled it after a week.  I'm going back to Byki - a much more fluid, intuitive little program."
0,"Bad software, worse 'support'.  The mother of all nightmare software. The negative reviews are correct, don't waste time nor money on this (Version 12.1) except for the crudest of edits.  It did support Canon HV40 and iPhone 4s capture but could not write Blu-ray DVDs except by writing to a file, then using other software to burn the disc.<br />  The user community agrees that DVD menus have serious flaws.  I almost bought another burner fefore I found out it is impossible to insert 'return to main menu' segments on a DVD.  Look elsewhere for prosumer video editing!<br />  My system is no slouch:  Win 7 64 bit pro SP1; Intel i7-4820K @3.70, 16 GB, MB is Gigabyte X79-UP4 and is DEDICATED to video editing.  I'm going back to Pinnacle Studio ( I read the bugs have been fixed in V17.5 and that it works for HD, even 4K video) or I might try Sony Studio."
4,Have used Turbo Tax for ever......I have 2001 through 2015!!!
3,"Like: Imported prior TT easily with no mistakes.  Can do multple family members simple returns. The GUI has improved over the years<br /><br />Dislike:  I need to file in 2 states (I live in one and work in another) and the price for a second state is too high $40 and must buy direct from TT, not Amazon"
0,"If I could give this zero stars I would.  I've been a loyal customer for years and years.  I read all the negative posts here, but after reading the update from the VP saying that we would be able to upgrade to Premier at no cost on the 7th, I went ahead and purchased.  Well, today is the 7th and when I try to upgrade it still tries to get me to enter credit card info so they can charge me.  They lied.  I gave you guys a second chance because of past products, but never again.  DO NOT BUY this product."
1,"I purchased and downloaded Quicken 2012 and am very disappointed with what you get for the money over Quicken 11. Honestly, there is absolutely NOTHING in this new version that is worth the cost. The home page bar graphs that show you how you are doing for the month are apparently updated now to include bills and deposits in your scheduled bills/deposits area and also includes your budgeted amounts I guess, but I never really looked at that and doesn't seem to be a huge deal. When I saw this new \\""feature\\"" being described in the small brochure that I received about this version, I incorrectly believed that your budget items would now be included in the projected balance chart. Unfortunately that's not the case and I know MANY customers who want this. If you don't want it or don't think you want it, then you have never used it and therefore don't understand the benefit of it. The projected balance chart is a very big feature that I look at all the time to let me know how I am doing, and shows me if I need to make some small adjustments to future bill payment dates or amounts to avoid going into the red at a later time. Unfortunately in Quicken, the projected balance chart DOES NOT include budget items! It only includes what you manually enter into your scheduled bills/deposits section. Huge miss. What sense is a projected balance chart if it doesn't even take into consideration your everyday expenses?  Microsoft Money had a feature where you could enter budget amounts for things like gas, groceries, spending, etc. on a weekly basis, and it would automatically add those items to your scheduled bills/deposits area. Of course, this meant that those amounts would also automatically adjust your projected balance chart to give you an accurate picture of your balance in the future. Additionally, as you spent money in those particular budget categories during the week, it would automatically deduct those amounts from your weekly amounts that you had setup so you always knew how much money you had left for a given week in those categories.  To make it work in Quicken, what you have to do is manually create \\""bills\\"" for each of those budgeted weekly amounts, and then manually deduct from them as you spend in those categories during the week. It can be done, and I am used to it now, but Money made it so much more convenient.  Anyway, overall I like Quicken. I wouldn't know what to do if I didn't have software like this to help manage my money. But I am very disappointed with what this new version offers over Quicken 11."
2,"I've used Quicken for many years and like the overall product features. However, being forced to upgrade to a half-baked version is a bad way to run a financial software company. The changes for 2014 I can see are the color scheme and the mobile apps. Neither I care about. But I did notice the issues with my data import. Multiple settings changed or reverted to a state from many years ago. Also There is a drop down menu (the old one I assume) just under the new one. Great work by that software team. I can still click on those items. I'm an engineer and work with software engineers that create better looking/working products from scratch. So in 3 years when they force me to upgrade again I hope they spend a little more time fixing the bugs (also called new features). Anyone that can help it should start with an older version or wait to upgrade."
2,"this did the job as far as actually completing the taxes.  However, navigation between forms, etc was not good at all.  I have used the free fill in Federal forms in the past, and the navigation between forms was infinitely better."
4,I was very happy that iNTUIT offered a FREE product upgrade if the deluxe version did not have everything we needed to complete our taxes this year.  We did need to upgrade and my husband was very happy that INTUIT offered this option.  This made a big difference with our belief in the product.  Will be purchasing this product again next year!  Thanks Intuit!!!
2,"It's OK, much like the last version I had (2012). Unfortunately, I have noticed it takes more time to download bank data than 2012 did."
2,Had to pay another 150.00 to get it to working right
0,"Don't buy. I should have read the reviews before I paid out good money for a lousy product. I have MS OFFICE home and student edition. I only needed Outlook so that's what I got -NOT I don't have full access to the calendars, sharing, sending etc. because I need to purchase Office (I thought I did). I am out $$ and faced with throwing more to make this work. I am furious. This is a horrid way to treat your customers Microsoft and shame on you Amazon for not making your customers aware that you needed to purchase the ENTIRE Office suite before Outlook would work. Shame."
0,The downloaded version did not contain an activation key  code which makes it useless.  I also downloaded other software with the same result.  I should get a refund from somebody.
4,was a great purchase for a gift of a garmin navigator many years ago. just needed a 4gb card to expand my old unit's memory
1,i have been a satisfied fan of Quicken since the first edition some years ago.  When i could not print single checks on quicken 2013 i was bounced back and forth between canon tech support (for my image class d 1320) and quicken support. after a few futile round trips quicken told me i must have a corrupt program file and i decided to try the upgrade to Quicken 2014 only to have the same problem. this has been going on about 2 months. my excellent new canon printer tackles anything i throw it except these single checks. My work flow makes it highly inconvenient to wait until i have three checks on the same page.  The Intuit checks are of course expensive and i am now stuck with a large supply. i can only hand write single checks now and no relief in sight.  i have spent many hours with quicken live chat to no avail and no way to reach a person by phone.
1,"Had a very expen$ive, somewhat complex tax return so bought this to compare results with my H&R Block tax results.  TurboTax gave very similar results.  I think Intuit's policy of forced obsolescence (with Quicken) is pretty evil/terrible, so I wouldn't recommend TurboTax over H&R Block's tax prep software.  Otherwise I think the programs are very similar."
4,"It's easy to use,you can't go wrong if you just follow the clear instructions."
3,Great for multiple computers and checks a lot of areas for virus and does a tuneup.  Easy to download and use.
3,It was much easier to do this year than 2 years ago.  I also finished my taxes faster than years past when using TurboTax.
2,"Still missing roll-ups in reports, single most useful function of the PC version - why not for the Mac?"
3,"In the past, books that didn't balance would stop you dead, unable to complete the tax return. Despite meticulous record keeping and a simple business, my books never matched. This year, for the first time, I can finish my taxes and figure out the bookkeeping problem later since I know that I am paying proper taxes. A better program would help the user figure out the balance problem, even if it is outside the defined scope of the product. Some other areas could do with better explanations."
0,"I have purchased a version of Norton every year for over 16 years for its virus scanning capabilities.  Norton 360 was a piece of junk, but still provided virus protection in spite of being an absolute CPU hog.  I've been using Norton Internet Security the past few years in spite of it not giving me as much control as I'd like.  But none of them were as bad as this version of Norton Security.  It nagged me EVERY DAY because I chose not to install its toolbar in Chrome - in spite of checking the option (every day!) to never remind me again.  I finally gave in and installed it.  Then I promptly disabled it because I just don't like 3rd party toolbars in my browsers.  Guess what?  Now the stupid software is nagging me again because the toolbar is disabled!  Argggggghhhhhhh!!!  Enough already!  Norton Security has become the MALWARE that it's supposed to protect me against!<br /><br />Unless this major bug gets fixed soon, I will NOT be purchasing another Norton product.  There are many other virus protection programs out there (including free ones) that will protect me without the constant nag screens.  Norton has lost its focus on this product and forgets what its software is supposed to do.  It's time to leave it behind."
2,Good product
3,We bought this instead of TurboTax because they jerked us around  for a 1099 filing and wanted $90 for something we had paid $15 or $20 for 20 years!  My wife thought H&R Block basic was better in some regards. We imported our TurboTax filing from the year before and made our refund without problem.
0,This product has no support and is impossible to set up and link to the bank.  There is no tech support and the chat people cannot even type in decent English.  I am just trying to figure out how to get my money back ASAP.<br /><br />I will never use one of their products again.
4,"Having used Norton 360 for many years...I became frustrated with the amount of time and hard drive space it was taking up. It was taking up to 15 mins to load up when turning on my computer. Then I watched a commercial on TV and was impressed that PC Matic was developed and administered in the U.S. After my purchase I deleted Norton and installed PC Matic. Since its installation, my computer has made leaps and bounds in the performance of both speed and reliability. I would highly recommend PC Matic for everyone who is looking for the best in a program that delivers what it says it will."
1,Not user friendly for proper placement and height of structures.Very time consuming just to find out its not even close to a working plan..
0,"Quicken Deluxe 2015,<br />I ahve been a quicken user  from 1996 to now,  the program has worked great up till now..  bought 2015, loaded it and wiped out out my vault password,  tryed everything several times,  intuit has locked me out,,,  i called the bank, they transfered me to Quicken and they asked me if i had the original pin they had sent me,  well no..  over 20 years,,  so they said would send a new pin,  3 to 5 days.. its been 2 weeks and 2 more phone calls,  and no pin,,  so i am being forced to convert over to the banks online bill pay...  Seams quicken dosnt care about there customers,, i am so frustrated with this,  We need some comption softwear out there,,  We need  Microsoft bring back Microsoft Money,,,,,,  Buyer be ware,"
2,My account was canceled for invalid payment methods even when I had one on file. Adobe's support will end up redirecting you to Amazon.
0,"This has caused me more trouble than I care to relate. It most definitely did NOT get me a bunch of money that I didn't know I had coming to me, like the commercials would have you think. Intuit makes a flawed product and then creates an impossible to contact customer service center. Brilliant! Stay away at all costs."
1,"It seems harder to use this year.  I've used Turbo Tax for at least 17 years, but I don't think I'll buy it next year."
4,"I've spent a number of years filing taxes at the whims of my CPA.  Over that last couple of years I have been really over charged for relatively simple tax scenarios.  I finally took my return from my CPA, plugged the figures into Turbo Tax and compared the results. They were the same.  Turbo Tax is simple to use, walks you through your various tax situations, and imports your various form from banks and brokerage firms.  File electronically, and save that file that is then used to per-populate your next year's returns.  Using Turbo Tax has empowered me to learn more about my own taxes, and I can complete my own returns in about 1/2 hour.  Now I'm trying to understand why my CPA was charging me 2 to 2.5 hours to complete my taxes.<br />Turbo Tax is great and Amazon give you a good discount on the product.  I've never had a problem downloading it and both Tubro Tax and Amazons support is excellent.  Kudos!"
3,"As far as free software goes, it's very impressive. It does pop up at least once a day and make noises (&#34;Avast Virus Database has been updated&#34;) and with the occasional other annoying notification, but it functions quite well. I haven't had any virus problems since I got it."
1,"It got my computer much slower and didn't fixed hackers blocking passwords,altering pictures, downloading my docum, etc. It did same simple tasks as those antivirus offered for free."
2,This program Ks not what I have had before and is difficult to use. I will make do.
2,"I am a little disappointed in Microsoft, due to them requiring you to be using Windows to use this program, it I could be on my Linux computer with this it would be ranked 4.<br /><br />If it did not crash every once and a while it would be 5"
1,"I decided to upgrade my opinion after playing with this some more.  I think one should be able to get a simple listing of income and expenses for the month that one can import into excel.  The reports don't export and when I try to just get a list off income and expenses I can get a pretty report, and it does export, but breaks it up by account and puts it in 5 different pages on an excel workbook.  I upgraded it slightly in that if someone does not manipulate the information but just wants to see a pretty picture of their expenses this would work.  It does download information from banks and credit cards well.  I haven't added my investments yet so I haven't an opinion there.  This program is a very poor relative of the PC version by Intuit.  I wish they had waited and done a better version."
2,i have used quicken for many years. this time for some unknown reason several figures were changed when i upgraded. this has never happened before. i was fortunate to have a back computer where i found the correct numbers.
0,"The download had multiple problems downloading. First amazon failed to make the purchase available after processing the order. Then after the first attempt to install the screen resolution was changed and would not allow me to manually change it.  The recommended resolution was the resolution running.  Then when the desktop shortcut was removed the entire program could not be started from any of the menu choices. Even restoring the shortcut from the trash bin the software would not open.  An attempt to reinstall from amazons web site only removed any trace of the Quicken but not as far as the reinstall was concerned it kept asking to remove the quicken previous versions manually, which there were no trace left on the computer.  Software from amazon, never again unless its delivered as a hard copy.  No more downloads of software!!!"
3,"I continue to like this product.  Normally I buy the download and use the key to renew.  This time the key did not work and I had to download the new version and install it.  The 300 mb download took an hour on a 20mbps internet connection.  Other things downloaded after this finished were faster so I think the amazon site was the problem.  On my other computers, I upgraded using the Norton 'check for a new version'.  That downloaded and installed faster and the key worked on those other 2.  I think you can't beat the price though.  A good product and a bargain to update 3 PC's.  This new version has the Windows 8 look to it"
3,"I have been using this Norton product for years, and am mostly pleased, but if you buy it through Norton it will cost a lot more and unless you delete your credit card information Norton will renew it for another year at an even higher price. The only difficulty I had with this download was my own fault--be sure to use the activation code in your Amazon Games and Software Library to avoid the same problem, which was that Norton didn't recognize that I purchased a new subscription."
3,Its a good product. I had been using an Excel spreadsheet I designed before and I may still like that more as it is a bit more functional but the ability to download account activity is hard to beat
3,"The program works fine, but as I bought it through Amazon, the available update (8) was only available to me for full price as the email about it arrived greater than the 6 months they were allowing Amazon buyers.  I bought it less than a year ago and that does not seem to reasonable to me.  No good answers."
3,The product is great. I would recommend it to all. Easy to use.
3,It works and works good. The only confusion was for my rental property. It listed the costs for management the property but the cost for common repairment was a kind confusion though I found a place to put in the costs.
1,"Used it for a month.<br /><br />Pros:<br />None over Quicken 2011<br />1, the upgrade went smoothly.  No problems getting the data converted<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Bank connections go haywire on a regular basis.  I have had to reset connections to various banks at least 3 times in 30 days.<br />2. Customized reports routinely get reset to the default"
1,I did not really have a chance to use this software because of complex loading procedures. I have used previous versions and they functioned very well.
3,"I have used Quicken Mac 2007 since it was new.  I didn't like Quicken Essentials at all.  However, Quicken 2015 is the first time I have even considered upgrading.  There are a lot of great ideas put into Q15.  My favorite feature is the ability to use the desktop and mobile app together.  In fact, my wife and I both use the app on our own phones and now have the ability to share a \\""checkbook\\"".<br /><br />Ok so you need to know a few things if you are going to do the upgrade.  Yes, you can import your Quicken Mac 2007 files without issue.  Yes, you can get your all of your online accounts, even ones that they wanted you to pay extra for in the past AND those that were only web downloads.  That's a huge plus.  The downfall is that the first time you run online update, you will have a ton of duplicates to clear out or match-up (drag on top of each other).  Tip- look for the ones that are not reconciled already.  You will also need to add back the columns you like for each account you use.<br /><br />You will also have to re-learn a few things.  For example, the online transactions don't come into a box for you to inspect anymore, they just go right into the account.  The reconcile feature is a bit different too.<br /><br />I don't use the investments or budgets very much, so I don't know how to advise you there.<br /><br />Overall, I do think that this updated Quicken worth the effort.  Being able to see my checking account and credit cards on my phone is enough to make the change."
4,"I love this program.  I had it at work before I retired and found it really useful.  It now really helps me process the mountain of paperwork associated with retiring, insurance, and moving to a new state.  I use the ability to add and delete pages, do text recognition (saves file space and makes the doc searchable), encryption (for sending in email or storing in Dropbox), and for filling in forms and signing/initialing them.  I use a [[ASIN:B009IA6Q0G Xerox DocuMate 152 Color ADF 8.5x14\\"" Duplex Scanner - Bundle - with Nuance PDF Converter Professional 7.0 Student Software for Windows]] to scan documents at 600 dpi, which I then use the Acrobat text recognition on.  I don't have to save all that paper now."
4,Very easy to use.  Saved my previous info.  Helped me to remember things I might have forgotten.  I'm sure I'll buy it next year.
1,Can not download on as many computers as it says (or won't download properly) Nothing but problems with the email
3,"I really like Quicken Home & Business. I tried Quckbooks for our business, but I found the learning curve a little too steep for me. I had used Quicken before, so upgrading it to Home & Business made more sense for me.<br /><br />As will all software there are some things that are great and some things that could be improved. I find that their invoice template is too restrictive, but it's still functional and may improve with later updates."
2,"I don't like to spend a lot of time with instructions, so I like things people friendly. I found another web designer which made it quicker to get published. I'll try this one again."
4,Great Program
4,"I had always used other antivirus programs until our computer developed some issues.  I took it to a local computer guy, and he removed the other programs and installed avast!  It is easy to use and protects my computer without slowing it down too much.  The computer guy also installed Malwarebytes, and said that the combination of the two would offer the best protection for our computer."
2,"The tax program itself is quite good, but it seems very unreasonable for the cost to consumers of this software package keeps increasing each and every year!"
1,I am surprised and disappointed to now find out this is now rated the 'old version'. What's up? One needs a book to navigate through this program and the classes offered are expensive. So far has been a waste of time and money. Since I am stuck with this I will eventually buy a book for this. Does Amazon read these reviews?
3,"This is one of the few password managers that directly syncs across all devices.  Most others involve uploading and downloading, and/or exporting and importing.  I use it on my Windows 8.1 PC and Windows Phones and it has been a very easy to use and handy program.  Compared to other similar password managers, it's also a bargain.  Both versions need a few minor improvements, but the developer is definately on the right track."
4,"Functionally, seems identical to Creator 11. However, version 11 does not play well with windows 7 or 8, so had to upgrade to this version. I've tried other software over the years to burn cd's and this brand has always seemed more intuitive than other brands."
2,I am glad I had 5 years of Spanish in H.S. and college or this course would have been a lot less helpful.  Since I was using it to bring back some of the Spanish I had lost in forty years the course was helpful in bringing it back. I remembered some verbs and how to form some questions but it did not make me anywhere near fluent. It does a good job of continuing to review vocabulary.
4,Functionally does it all and more.  Some organization functions I haven't even explored all that well.  But simple things in photo fixing like auto smart fix is just amazing!
2,"Everything was as it always has been, it upgraded me when it was necessary.  Program is easy to use for me, unless I have a &#34;new&#34; tax situation in which I am unfamiliar & I need to ask a question.  It seems difficult to ask Turbo tax & easy to ask the community, but, you still have to wait on a reply.  I think turbo tax should have advisors to answer questions.  If they do, I was unable to locate a number or email in order to ask them a question.  I also think if you need a state return, you should be able to e-file that for free too, it costs $13.99 so I had to use the regular mail."
0,"This is a warning to those purchasing 2015 Home & Business.  I am not sure how I am going to import my bank transactions once they stop supporting 2012, but I would rather import them via QIF or OFX and stay with Quicken 2012 rather than use their TERRIBLE 2015 version.  It screen refreshes and redraws with every click.  Even if you just click into any field you will see it do 3 blinks.  When you hit SAVE, it refreshes the entire screen, the transaction disappears and then reappears after the screen rewrites itself from top to bottom.  Working on transactions gives a visually unstable feeling because it is always blinking.  In Quicken 2012 I could have 1,000's of attachments, with QDF file sizes over 5gb and it behaved as if it was a tiny file, no degradation at all and certainly no screen refreshes.  I spent an hour on the phone with Intuit Support making sure I had the right version and all the patches, uploading files etc and they were not able to give me any answers.  If you want to see the transcript, I have it.  They gave me a refund. Maybe if you have a really high-end PC with lots of memory it will be so fast you won't notice it but the fact is that constant screen refreshing is all over that version.  My bank site says it supports back to Quicken 2011."
3,Good product
2,"The Quicken program is fundamental to my financial activity and record keeping. It is a useful program, but not perfect. There are a few competitors, but they are flawed as well. I did not appreciate being forced to update to keep the ability to do auto downloads from my financial institutions."
2,same as last year except that it will not let you file Schedule F.  so you have to upgrade another $10.  another hidden cost.
3,"I got this after checking out and demoing Corel and Sony and looking into other programs - I have had Sony Platinum 9 for a few years was going to get their latest version but after trying PD 11 out I was very happy with it.<br />Plenty of support on their forum and free plugins from their site called Director Zone and also tutorials on youtube.<br />I find this program very user friendly.<br />If I had to do it again I would of gotten the Suite that adds Color Director, Photo Director and Audio Director.<br />I especially like Audio Director which is more full featured than their Wave editors that comes with the program. I ended up getting Audio Director separately and I love it. Of course for about 30 more bucks or so had I opted for the Suite I would of also had ColorDirector and PhotoDirector of which the latter one I would not find any use for since I use Lightroom, photoshop and various other plugins for photography.<br /><br />I did run into one issue, (that's why I took a star off from the rating) where the software kept lagging trying to create the preview file window... I googled and found a fix...I created a profile on my Nvidia GTX 670 for PowerDirector and then under that profile I disabled CUDA -GPU's. I set this to NONE.<br />And the program worked fine afterwards.<br />So overall I like this program a lot! There are plenty of cool features, and effects, and info to be found.<br /><br />My system,<br />Windows 8 64bit<br />Core I7<br />32 gig ram<br />Nvidia GTX 670"
0,"Who would have thought that TT would change the functionality of the various products to the point where purchasing the same product year after year would no longer provide the same level?  The Deluxe should more appropriately be known now as the &#34;Not So Deluxe.&#34;  I'm one,  who after years of using TT, will be seeking another vendor.  Will probably give H&R a shot.  And Mr. Meighan, what's the deal encouraging people to contact you so you can discuss how TT can keep you as a customer?  It's obvious how you can keep everyone as a customer...........undue this deception.  You also didn't make it clear that using the forms (manually) will override the audits and checking portions.  And also will not allow you to e-file."
2,"The IRS is not refunding money owed to taxpayers in a timely manner. Turbo Tax has no provisions for answers to problems with the IRS. I filed my return on January 28, 2013 and as of March 1, 2013 I have still not received any information as when my refund is coming."
4,I'm glad I finally decided to get this because it makes my life easier when converting others documents and also I just know my way around it better than anything else I tried using.
4,Fast and Easy
1,"With my Quicken Deluxe 2010 release I noticed a number of transaction omissions.  I upgraded to 2013 assuming that would fix the problem.  Not so. With one account, I found 6 omissions and two incorrect amounts for the month of January.  Even worse, my primary bank accounts (with Chase) do not download at all.  I'm currently trying to track down the problem."
1,"Poor quality product.  Does not allow for much customization and the output photos are very poor, also. It is difficult to give it a massive, organized library of photos to draw from, also"
1,"If you are purchasing this product to renew an existing or expired Enhanced Payroll subscription be advised you need to spend 20 minutes or more on the telephone with Intuit Payroll to get them to link the product into your Quickbooks account. I purchased this on Amazon because it is less expensive here than purchasing directly from Intuit, but if I had know it would require time on the phone with Intuit I would have just paid Intuit their higher fee and been done with it.<br /><br />Once you get it linked to your existing Quickbooks setup and share the wealth with Intuit, the Enhanced Payroll works very well for a small business. It links to your bank account and allows you to electronically file all of your payroll obligations, and keeps electronic records and receipts of all your transactions."
3,"I started out using the free version of Avast and was impressed with the ability of this program to minimize some problems that my computer was having. Since the paid program was installed, my computer has been running much better. That's not to say that it solved all the problems without a little oversight by my service man and myself."
3,"From payroll to estimates and invoicing to keeping my accountant happy, Quickbooks reduces the paperwork hassle of running a company to a minimum."
1,"I have tried to start the set up process several times unsuccessfully because I (apparently) don't know the \\""User name\\"" and \\""Password\\"" of my bank.  Of course I sign into my Bank almost daily directly (via internet)without any difficulty to check balances or deposits.<br /><br />I am presently taking a \\""Financial Peace\\"" course, so may be able to use Quicken for Budget purposes as I originally hoped."
0,THIS UPGRADE STINKS.  ALL THE POPUPS AND LOCKS YOU ON A LINE - WISH I HAD NEVER UPGRADED AND WILL BE LOOKING SOMETHING DIFFERENT IMMEDIATELY
3,"Too Many changes this year and not as user friendly. We have been using since it came out and was just harder to work with, perhaps due to the new stupid a tax Changes, I don't know. The format seemed different.But we were able to get through it and file electronically and got refunds back in a week. That is an awesome thing."
3,I've used Quicken for years.  The program is fine except one feature I used is missing.
1,"I've just taken the 30 day trial for MSOffice.  I have not used all areas.  That's why I'm only reviewing Word, for now.<br /><br />The install went okays but Word keeps freezing on me, literally, every 3rd time that I use it. The old Office never did that.  Actually, that's what inspired this review.  Word froze on me, again.  I'd just saved corrections to my research paper. Lost functionality so I had to close the window via task manager.  Reopened it...AND my paper wasn't saved with any of my additions.<br />This is not the end of the world but, damn it, this is a 20-page paper!  I've nursed a headache and two nosebleeds writing it. I'm not exactly angered, though, because I didn't buy it (thank God).  In fact, that I didn't purchase is the only thing preventing a massive conniption fit the likes of which this library has never seen.  I'm just irritated.  So, of course, this is an opportune time to take it out on the internet. LOL<br /><br />Additionally, this version of Word (at least) doesn't really add anything new.  They've just switched how you go about doing things about.  Visually, it's a step-down from other versions. In my opinion. Personalizing for the 2010 was just better.<br />I actually like Windows 8 but this OFFICE?  I don't know why it's more expensive.<br />I plan to install MSOffice 2010 and be done with.<br /><br />I want to mention that I bought my computer direct from the factory a month ago.<br />It's not MY computer."
1,"I want to be fair and objective with this review and give positive credit where it is due. Quicken is a good program and it worked for a few short months as anyone would expect with bank transaction downloads and with the fundamentals. However, on May 15, 2014 we attempted to open it in from desktop (win 8) as usual and a window came up asking for our &#34;Data  Backup File password&#34; which had never happened before. We have one PW in Quicken and it rejected or PW many times, so we downloaded the &#34;Quicken Password Removal Tool&#34; so we could setup a new PW for Quicken. It didn't work, so we downloaded it 3 other times with the same results. As of this date, June 19, 2014 over 30 days later we are still unable to access Quicken to manage our personal or business data. I have been insulted by the way Quickens Chat support and telephone support has dealt with me and the technical problems with their software. The customer support (chat and Telephone) is limited in their ability to solve technical problems beyond their basic training. Telephone support is approved by the chat person and if they permit you to receive telephone support it is sent to India or the Philippians. Now my wife and I are educated and we were born and raised in the USA, we could not understand the gent from India (that is not his fault). Quicken doesn't evaluate the company adequately which they contracted with in India to provide support to their US customers. What is this? Are we expecting too much? I don't think so, after 6 chat sessions and two telephone supports for a total of 8 hours and 36 minutes and hours on the worthless forum nothing has been resolved.<br /><br />Customer Service Problems-only a few listed:<br />1- There has been no follow up as promised.<br />2- After 1.5 hours the telephone support in Asia and her supervisor said they did not know what the problem was and were unable to do-nothing further. She said a PW reset would be sent within 48 hours, it's three days now.<br />3- Promises made by chatting and not fulfilled i.e. This problem will be escalated. 3 days later we got an email with a link to Quicken Community Help. Unbelievable, what a slap in the face.<br />I have 2 pages of documentation on technical problems and all the chat transcripts and the issues within. We are exhausted by the lack of support and knowledge of the existing technical problems and the steps to resolve them.<br />Some examples of attempts to resolve issues:<br />1- Deleted and downloaded Quicken Software three time and we are still unable to access our data or the program.<br />2- Downloaded Quicken Password tool three times so we could reset our Data PW but it doesn't work.<br />Others are listed in our documentation which Quicken doesn't care about. Cat wants to start over like we've never had a problem before. Usually they don't even read the documentation that I upload and when I challenge them to go above and beyond (appropriately so) they get defensive and go back to asking me the same basic questions about my problem. I can understand that and the position they have been put in but it's not constructive.<br /><br />Quicken Documented Chat and Phone Incidents transcripts:<br />1) June 17, 2014-  Fifth Chat:  Incident: 140617-000886<br />Spent 1:45 minutes on the phone: tried resolving some of the issues with to avail, then downloaded the new Quicken software, reset PW at intuit.com etc. Downloaded QPT for the 3rd time it would not work again or allow us to select and accountt. She was going to forward to QPT team and that they would contact us within 48 hours.<br />2) June 16, 2014- Fourth Chat:  Incident: 140616-001455 we did not get support phone call as promised.<br />3) June 12, 2014 – Third Chat: Incident 140612-000403  “disconnected by power outage”<br />4) June 7, 2014 – Second Chat Incident: 140607-000152<br />5) May 21, 2014- First Chat Incident: 140521-000853 and Phone support<br /><br />I hope Quicken can reproach the way ithandles problem solving and out their customer near the top. This is a potentially good program.<br />Factually and Sincerely"
0,"I did a upgrade.  Now if I want to update my data I have to a Quicken ID, without it they will not let me do the old updates.  It is getting that everyone wants to know what your business is. Now with this you Quicken ID, my bank wants to charge me for it.  I wish I know about this before I bought the update.  I would not have.<br /><br />I even tried to do what they say and it still never worked.  They now are like MS, want you know all you business.  Will not be buying them again."
2,"This product has potential, but it is a little confusing to use."
1,"I moved to the US from the UK a few years ago. Until this year, I relied on these guys (used the online deluxe version) and filing taxes was  a smooth procedure. This year I when I came back I was shocked by the steep price increase compared to the last year. The deluxe online program had costed me $30 for 2013 taxes and with the 10% amazon gift card option I had offset the purchase. However this year the online version price was $60 and the gift card option was not there (at least for me).<br /><br />I found a $10 off deal (coupons.com partnered with turbotax) but although it was legitimate, somehow the website prevented me to take advantage of that deal, on top of that I was not even asked for the gift card option as well (5% was mentioned in some places). I kept filling the form hoping that it will finally give me the option to take advantage of these benefits but NO, they had gone crazy and just asked for my credit card details right before submitting (They even ask for an additional $40 processing fee if you choose the option of letting them take the money from your return instead of credit card...) Having spent 3 hours on preparing my taxes I had two options: Surrender and pay the full $60 price and forget about all the deals for the sake of convenience or just start over somewhere else. I chose the second option and went to H and R block free version.<br /><br />It took me another 2 hours to fill the form from scratch in  H&R website but in the meanwhile I realized that they actually have no difference at all. Similar questions, warnings, alerts, security check points, similar algorithm in comparing standard vs itemized deductions, similar level of instructions etc. And the final tax return H and R calculated was the same up to the last coin. On top of that even this free version was offering 5% bonus if I wanted to get part of my return in gift cards ( Target, starbucks, homedepot etc. in $100 increments.) I was happy with the result and filed it all for free with no hassle.<br /><br />If your taxes are relatively simple like me (married filing jointly, having W2 from employer, kids in daycare, house with mortgage, some interest from basic saving accounts, not too much work related deductibles and a few charitable donations) then go for it you won't even feel the difference. For those who have more complicated situations, it is up to you. (Honestly, I think the free H&R is still as good for anyone that thinks of getting TurboTax deluxe)<br /><br />Conclusion: I am sorry Turbotax, you have lost a customer for good... and you know what, just for the sake of convenience I was ready to pay the increased price if you at least let me take advantage of these discounts. But instead, you guys forced me to pay the full doubled price and that really pissed me off...<br /><br />Note: I gave it a 2 stars instead of 1 only for the sake of the good old days...f your taxes are relatively simple like me (married filing jointly, having W2 from employer, kids in daycare, house with mortgage, some interest from basic saving accounts, not too much work related deductibles and a few charitable donations) then go for it you won't even feel the difference.

1,"Avast! product is probably a very good download, it's the fact that AMAZON didn't include the info that AVAST WON'T RUN ON WINDOWS 10 (don't waste the time, you'll only get an error code when you try to install.)"
1,"I liked the older versions. This new version is not flexible enough. This review process is not cool. I don't like it at all. In fact, I believe that I will look for another package which would suite my need."
2,"I found Light Room a little disappointing. I have to admit that it is a much more straight-forward and easy to use product than some Adobe offerings (you have to be concerned when there is an entire industry developed around teaching you how to use Adobe products). I purchased LR looking for a program that may have a better interface between organizing and editing my photos. I have been using ACDSee Photo Manager 12 for about three years and was curious to see what LR offered.<br /><br />Organizing – ACDSee Photo Manager wins, hands down. LR gives you no information about an image in its Library until you run the cursor over it. And, then, very little. ACDSee PM allows you to determine, from a rather large selection of options, what info will be displayed with each thumbnail. I find that much faster when looking for an image with a certain parameter than waiting for LR to react to the cursor running over one thumbnail, then the next, then the next, etc. Organizing with tags, categories, and ratings is also much easier in PM. I also found it easier to locate cataloged images whether they are stored on my computer or CD/DVD.<br /><br />Editing – LR has a much more capable image editor than PM, but it is strongly geared to RAW image editing. Also, LR gives no information about which image (such as: DSC_2388.nef) you have open in the editor unless you open the thumbnail scroll frame at the bottom of the window. Unfortunately, that reduces the size of the edit window. And then, LR Editor uses some oddball native color space that even they say is not usable for printing, online, or most other imaging programs. This adds another editing step called “Soft Proofing” just so you can see what your image may look like when exported for its intended use. Sadly, LR does not give you the capability to change its editor’s unusual color space. I know sRGB is more restrictive, but my god, the world revolves around it.<br /><br />While both LR and PM allow selected image(s)to be opened in independent editors, LR requires you to dig into menus to address the function while PM lets you select a primary default editor with a button at the top of the Manage window and others in a Tool menu. This function is important to me because I have found that second party editors (including Adobe’s) don’t do as good a job as camera manufacturer’s editor when working with RAW files. Adobe’s DNG is good, but NEF in a Nikon editor is better.<br /><br />Now, all of this said, LR is not perfect, but a very capable program with a number of features that look very interesting to someone in need of them. I intend to continue working with it for a while to see if it has a place in my workflow. Try the demo before you make a decision. LR has not proven itself worthy of being my primary organizing program."
2,"Needed to upgrade from 2010 to 2013 because support ended for financial downloads. I use it for tracking investments and expenses. I've used Quicken for a decade now. For those who have never used it, I recommend it. For those upgrading, it's not much different."
2,"The Mac version is not as extensive as the windows version or maybe it is. But I guess for tacking my purchases it does the trick well enough. There are some features, like budgets and bill pay, which ought to be separated in functionality from the check register or have more of an ability to customize the bill and how and when it gets paid. But the set up and calculations are almost automatic so the numbers in the register get wonky. It's just kwerky."
4,I used Quicken for Mac for years and got a new computer and installed Quicken Essentials for a few years. I was not all that impressed. Now back to Quicken 2015 and love it. Even better than the older versions. Would highly recommend it.
0,"I have been a long time user of Quicken but I truly regret upgrading to 2013. I have lost transactions, projected balances do not project correctly, and many other problems. I am running on update #10 for 2013 and still have problems. I can not recommend this product Quicken 2013. I also hate the expense of updating to a newer version as the price is much higher than other software upgrades. I can buy a new version on line cheaper that I can buy an upgrade from Intuit!"
0,"Excellent piece of mallware that will screw up your internet connection as well as set up auto renewal of you licence. Not only will you have to pay for again but this time they will show you their customer appreciation by charging you $90 second time around. At this point you will spend endless hours of fun trying to get a refund and find where that auto-renew option is. Good luck! But be assured that your money is being put to good use, namely buying 5 star reviews on all the relevant tech sites. On a positive not your PC will fly once you uninstall this piece of cow pie."
0,I spent hours on the phone with McAfee trying to download this program! Three different people at McAfee. I gave up.  I downloaded a FREE anti virus program.  No problems! I noticed that Norton was the best selling one at Amazon.  The reviews show that others had the same problem.  I think there were just too many steps to install this program
3,"Installed on windows 7 with no issues. Was able to create and export resumes with no issues.<br />After reading others reviews, I was very worry about buying this software, but it works as advertised. For the $17.00 price, it does a good job of helping you create resumes.<br />I did not have to use their Customer support."
0,I am new at downloading.  The downloading information did not mention that a Yosemite operating system was needed to download.  I spent $84.00 for absolutely NOTHING.  Totally unfair.
1,Did not like that you had several different turbo tax versions- liked it better when you had turbo tax federal and state or turbo tax federal.
0,I have used TurboTax for Business for 3 years to do my husband's company's Form 1120-S and I will not use it again.  It is not user friendly and takes about 5 times longer than it should to prepare the return.
4,I love it. Very professional product. Get it if you are a photographer. I love the dark and light filter.  Noise reduction is amazing. U will not regret it.
4,This is the only program I have ever used and probably will always use it.  I love it. Thanks Quicken!
1,"The new version has been a disappointment. More steps, more time consuming and less efficient. Instead of improving it is harder to use and takes more time to do everything."
4,Very easy to download. I love it.
4,Very good
4,Quick and easy. On top of it all. Able to protect all PC's in the house<br />great buy for all
0,"I got Quicken Deluxe 2013 for my PC because I wanted to use it for my IPad when we travel.  The person I talked to said I would need to update Quicken for my PC and that there would be a free app to transfer the information to the IPad.  (I had asked this person on the phone if I would need to purchase a separate version).  The app is so limited . . . I wanted the financial information (IRA . . . stocks . . . etc).  I wanted to download every day the information on how the market was doing.  Of course, this was impossible.  I wouldn't have got the new one for my PC had I known this."
0,"I usually use H&R Block, but I switched to Turbo Tax because of the &#34;too good to be true&#34; 10% Amazon gift card refund offer.<br /><br />Well it's true what they say - &#34;If it's too good to be true, it probably is&#34;.<br /><br />The problems started when I got an email saying that my federal refund had been reduced, and because of that, the amazon refund had been cancelled.<br /><br />However, my federal refund had not been reduced.<br /><br />After huge amounts of time on the phone to Turbo Tax, main response was &#34;we can not do nothing about it&#34;<br /><br />Eventually, explanation was given that &#34;the small print say that refund by amazon gift card is not guaranteed&#34;<br /><br />Intuit - please do the right thing, and fix this."
4,"Photoshop CC has introduced an abundance of new features that has improved my digital imaging workflows tenfold. As someone who was investing in every new release of Photoshop CS, the subscription has provided me with the spending model I need to be up to date with the latest features."
3,"I know nothing about accounting, but was elected Treasurer of a non profit organization and needed help. Quickbooks Online has been a godsend; it's easy to set up and use, and easy to correct mistakes. It's made it possible for me to stay on as treasurer, rather than run away screaming."
0,It's ridiculous in 2013 to sell any software that doesn't include a version for Mac OS.  This is why I just don't bother with Quicken products.
2,wrong order
3,This is amazing and thanks to Microsoft for helping me to see that there is an alternative to their subscription service.
3,I have been using this brand of tax preparation software for many years now and find it more than capable for my taxes!
4,The Nortron was exactly the same as I found at the store for 1/3 the price.  It was easy to install and working great.
2,I could not get it to download on my system. Amazon tried to get it to go onto my system but it would not. They gave me my money back and I was happy.
4,I have owned Adobe Premiere since version 3.  I have used other video editing software which is included with hardware I have purchased.  None of them have satisfied like Adobe Premiere.
4,I bought this to protect my mom's computer. Easy installation and automatic updates. Couldn't be better. Got it on her system just before another &#34;viral&#34; attack.
3,Works as advertised.
1,"Rude of Intuit. But don't panic. True, you can no longer enter capital gains and losses via the interview mode. But this desktop download allows for gain and loss entry via the form mode. Either as a &#34;Cap Gains Wks&#34; or as a &#34;Form 1099-B Worksheet&#34;. Though my experimenting so far keeps resulting in the generation of a Form 8949 and data on lines 1b and 8b of the Schedule D itself. Whereas, for my 2014 transactions, I should only need lines 1a and 8a on the Schedule D. Let me know if anyone solves this. Or if you are listening at Intuit...<br /><br />Supposedly, using the program this way means that e-file won't work. It is too early to test this. But I cannot e-file anyway.<br /><br />With regards to complaints that this version has no state coverage... Not all US states have income tax and not all US citizens live in US states. I am glad that I do no have to pay $10 more for a state version. Just take care when ordering..."
0,"I have used Quicken for over ten years. It seems to be every update, just makes the program more difficult to use. Now I can't save my reports to PDF format. I tried to export like they tell you but it just does not work!<br />Also for some reason now my budget report is totally screwed up. Instead of totally the subcategories of a particular category, it NO LONGER totals them up at all.<br /><br />Man if I could get my hands on the people who do these updates!!!"
2,"Had no real expectations of this software which is good because it's quite disappointing compared to the pictures of designs on the packaging. Unfortunately, I downloaded this so it can't be returned. The only way you can get the quality of pictures on the packaging (I presume) is if you upgrade to the Pro version at $495.00. I feel like I was suckered in and I'm mad because I fell for it."
2,"Quicken 2013 works fine for relatively simple financial needs and connects to most banks for direct download.  The interface is still dated and could use some freshening up, it appears to be pretty similar to the interface from the 1990s."
1,It may be nice but I have no help using it<br />Can Simone call me to help me 3476508230<br />Please
3,So far it is working good.
2,"Also costs way too much...went with Webroot when it was time to renew...not as much memory, cheaper, but having glitches that I haven't narrowed down - so cannot recommend it either."
2,"Seems to work pretty well. Has blocked intrusions several times, and warned me about several questionable websites.<br />However, you get what you pay for. I get pop-ups several times a day, asking me to &#34;upgrade&#34;."
0,It cost even higher than turbotax website. Adding one state need 40 something and e-file need 20 bucks. not worth
2,"The program is ok, but one problem I had with my '11 Quicken of freezing the computer whenever I put the curser over a news item under Investing/Portfolio still remains."
3,"Its office, what can I say"
0,I purchased this software back in October 2011 and have been having issues with invoices the numbers show up wrong and negative and i have communicated with customer service for the past year. They stated it will be resolved in the next update like a broken record to no avail it has not been fixed yet. I contacted them on August 31 2012 they refuse to let me talk with a supervisor about this continuing issue.  Don't buy this software it is nothing but disappointments. this software should get negative stars you can not run a business with the wrong numbers its a nightmare to keep track of.
0,"I've been a 10-year customer.  TurboTax has pulled a fast one.  They may not lose a lot of money this year because people are used to buying this product, but will get duped from all the changes and will get extorted for extra $$$ to get the same features in last year's Deluxe..  I'm one of them.  They have my money this year, but have lost a customer forever.  I highly recommend voting with your wallet and finding another package.  I'm moving to H&R Block.  Good bye Intuit - TurboTax.  If it was possible to give them NO STAR's I would have."
3,"I have had Norton Internet Security for five years now. It does a good job, and has evolved into a product that is 'light' on my system -- does not slow down my computer the way pre-2008 versions did -- and protects my system reasonably well against incoming viruses. Each year there are additional improvements to the program.<br /><br />I will be resubscribing next year.<br /><br />I gave it a 4 instead of a 5, because it did miss one Trojan virus that was caught by my Super Anti Spyware program. Most experts I read state that you really need one anti-virus program and a separate malware program. The two programs both running on my computer pretty much catch everything."
1,was looking for a more advanced graphic logo program... doesnt impress me at all.<br />would be better if it was more photoshop-ish
0,would not download
1,"I used Quicken 2010 Premier almost daily for 3 years to track and manage my bank accounts and investments. This year I had to upgrade to 2013 because the ability to automatically update my accounts is ending at the end of April.<br /><br />2010 was relatively stable, the flickering user interface and occasional issues with transactions were annoying but the program worked alright and the view into my finances was pretty good, I thought. I track my 401(k), rollover IRA, a Roth IRA, multiple direct stock purchase plans, checking & savings accounts and 2 brokerage accounts, one for options trading and one for long-term stock investments.<br /><br />Now that I have \\""upgraded\\"" to 2013 I really miss 2010. I never thought I would say that.<br /><br />2013 changes the way you view your accounts so that by default you just see a transaction register. To see the holdings, you have to click a button which brings up a separate window. Apparently this change was made in the 2011 version. This is a cumbersome way to navigate the UI due to multiple clicks and multiple windows popping up and disappearing. Also, there is much less information in these views. In 2010, you could see a pie chart of holdings, quarterly dividends, capital gains, contributions, realized and unrealized gains and you could navigate through time easily. In 2013, only some of these features are there but they are not available in a default account view. It's just very cumbersome and very hard to get a quick summary view.<br /><br />What I used to be able to do by simply clicking on the account name I now cannot do without navigating multiple windows, and I don't think all of the 2010 features are even there. If they are, they are not easy to find. I've spent some time with the program and in the \\""support\\"" forums (which mainly seem to be filled with complaints and few answers).<br /><br />I will continue to use this program because even with the reduced utility of the data presentation it does still offer decent performance tracking and I will admit that it handles option contracts better than 2010. On the other hand, I find myself cursing this program every time I use it now (still almost daily, though for as little time as necessary). I can't, however, recommend it. I will not upgrade again until I absolutely have to, and in the meantime I am actively looking for alternative ways to track my money."
1,can't do anything about it now because with this you have to keep it or loss your money but I will not advise anyone to by this one
1,"I have used iMovie on my Macbook for years and loved it.  Unfortunately my Macbook died so I was looking for a Windows equivalent.  I read this was considered the iMovie for Windows, so I took the plunge.  Basically...I am disappointed.  It it not nearly as intuitive or user friendly. Something as simple as transitions and titles took me hours to figure out via YouTube videos.  You CAN make decent movies, but what used to talke me an hour or so takes a couple days.  Disappointed."
2,"I've used the free version but was tempted by the advertising to buy the paid version.  I think you are probably just as well off as sticking with the free version.  If you get either version, search on line for how to turn off the sounds.  Seems like there is a verbal announcement five times a day that the virus catalog has been updated.  I want anti-virus software to work in the background, not constantly telling me what a good job its doing."
3,My daughter likes it a lot and is motivated to keep using it.
3,"I have 2 home computers so thought I could get the upgrade for both at the one price, if I can I need to know how to download on 2nd computer without separate cost. I have used avast for several years and love it. This was my first experience with the Pro. I'd like to have it on both my laptop, which is the one I did the purchased upgrade AND my pc. Thanks for making such a good product affordable:)"
3,I like to copy the text of articles from web pages and Word 2013 appears to work much faster than my old Word 2002.
3,Easy to use. adaptable to personal needs. Good program. I can control my cash flow by tracking my income and expenses
3,Long-time user finds little to say. I'm not sure premium is worth it for me. I don't have much experience with alternatives.
1,I cannot automatically download my banking transactions without paying a monthly fee to my bank. I am requesting a refund for this product!
4,Good offer
1,facebook upload does not work I contacted the company no reply
4,We have been very satisfied using the avast free antivirus software for several years now. The product came recommended to us from a very reputable business and were happy to see that the download was available through the cnet website. We have many other cnet downloads that we are also very satisfied with.
3,I bought it mainly because I wanted the condense file feature.  An update brought back the traditional items on the start/home page.
3,"Works essentially as it does every year. I hate that the costs seems to be going up, but it filed my joint return with no issues. Worth the price if you do not want to pay for an accountant but want to make sure its done correctly."
1,"I'm no tech expert, so I might've been able to find a get-around for this, BUT...for some reason, Avast shut down my wireless (internet), and I couldn't get back on until clearing (uninstalling) all of Avast. Never had that with Norton, which I now have again.<br />Others say it's great, so don't take my word for it, research it. Good Luck."
1,"Disappointed. I've been using Quicken for over 20 years. Upgraded to 2014 from 2012, specifically to use Mint-like mobile integration feature. Upgrade offer I received by mail touted the mobile integration. It does not work for me. Sync with Well Fargo accounts fails. I've seen postings on various forums about the problem. Intuit responses are vague and not helpful. I have neither the time nor motivation to track it down. Also, while Mint allows synchronization with different types of financial accounts, like investments, Quicken Mobile only syncs with bank and credit card accounts. I give 2014 two stars only because desktop version still works. I will continue to use Quicken and Mint separately. The upgrade was not worth the price."
3,"quick and easy way to do accurate tax returns yourself, makes electronic filing easy, just zip boom bang its done"
1,"I&#34;m disappointed with turbo tax having used it for over 20 years with no problems. Bought Deluxe version thinking it was the same as last year, Not true had to upgrade twice to get all forms needed. Ended up with Home and Business with an additional upcharge of $ 40.00 from Deluxe version.<br />These guys have really disappointed me with the upgrades and difficult point of sale information I will look at other software next year.<br /><br />What&#34;s wrong with these dopes? Oh Yea if you want the $ 25.00 for the mess they created go fill out another form!!!"
1,The HELP function never worked.  H&R Block support helped me uninstall and reinstall but it didn't help.  Will consider another option in the future.
0,"I liked this, as it made me feel like I was being safe. The green checks by websites on google. But when I was trying to go to a website I knew to be okay, just a plain ole internet forum, it would block me. I checked the box saying I knew the site, and proceed, it would send me to an ad page. I turned it off, it still blocked me. I sent it to trash, it's still blocking me. Trying to remove it from my machine is impossible. Seems to be a virus, itself.<br /><br />Update: I thought I had it all deleted. Then, this morning it's icon is back on my tool bar, vigilantly protecting me from a carpentry forum. I can't wait to see the thing they'll sell me for a hundred bucks to remove it."
2,"I've been using Turbotax for more than fifteen years. I started because I also started using Quicken long ago, and the numbers transfer over automatically fairly well. It gets the job done."
0,"Due to the terrible reviews here, I will not be buying Turbo Tax this year. I will look into Tax Cut software instead."
1,"This is about the worst software I have used.  Unfortunately it is about the only software out there that allows you to keep all of your stuff local.  I feel like I have been transported back to Windows 3.1 software design.  It performs very poorly with ~ years of data.  Context menus are wonky, some only show up if you hover, other left click and the others right click.  The only thing it has going for it is the ability to download directly from banks."
0,"After purchasing this software update, necessary each year, I now find that I cannot exile my state taxes due to frequent fraudulent users using this product.  Am I to expect a partial refund of this reduced ability now that I own this software.  Unlikely by the sounds of things and the other less than stellar reviews of this product."
4,I've used this for years and well worth it. Super simple and super fast.
1,"I purchased Norton Security (2015) at Amazon. Following the instructions provided, I went to [...]. However, I am forwarded to a nonexisting site, receiving the error message \\""Firefox can't find the server at manage.norton.com.\\"" Same with IE. I fill out the form on the Norton site to receive help and receive \\""Gateway Timeout - The proxy server did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.\\"" Really, Norton. Why not just allow a download from Amazon, like everyone else, especially if you can't keep your site up?!    Update: I discovered a work-around to the above issues. On the front page of the Norton web site, click Downloads/Free Trials. Install the trial version. After entering your Norton account information, but before clicking Next to activate the software, click enter license key on the lower left side (opposite Next to activate on the lower right). Enter the license key Amazon provides, and the software is licensed and activated. Again, if the software is downloadable to anyone, why not simply allow a download direct from Amazon after purchase?!    So far, Norton Security (2015) appears identical in function to Norton Internet Security 2014, with an interface face-lift to the minimalist interface that is currently popular.    Increased one star to two stars, pending further experience with Norton Security (2015)."
3,"It's turbo tax, so there shouldn't be too much surprise in what you're getting. The Amazon download process was pretty easy."
4,"I'm a Mid-level guy with computers and when I need something that does well, I use Avast. Newer versions announce updates complete on each startup-that's nice piece of mind. just remember since it's free, they will always recommend their paid versions. someday I might, but for now, my budget doesn't allow."
4,"TurboTax user for many years, no problems with this version. I probably will buy it again next tax season in 2015."
0,Biggest waste of money. Product is garbage! I bought this to create DVDs for my sons all star team for end of year party. Spent few hours building DVD only to burn it and then load it on DVD player ...the buttons don't work and you can even play the thing. I had started this Thursday and I had to get DVD done by the party on Sunday and I tried to contact their customer support but had to wait 48 hours to get an email response which I got a response 3 days later today Monday... and that was utterly useless support reply. I am a network engineer and very tech savvy. I found a different program by Coral DVD Movie Factory Pro 7 which was fantastic and worked fine with no problems. I asked for a refund and was told I could not get one but I could get a similar crap product for same value instead.
4,My virus protector kept informing me that it had expired.  It did the same thing on my laptop as well as this desktop.  After much research found Webroot and it has been great.  Doing Genealogy on family and with that comes all kinds of threats on web sites and this AntiVirus Device has not let me down.  Will definitely renew next year if it continues working as it does now.
4,I have used Turbo Tax for over 15 years and wouldn't use anything else.  It is user friendly and logical.  The help is absolutely the best.
1,"I use Quicken for my home finances and QuickBooks for my business.  A couple years ago, I got a note from QuickBooks telling me that I could continue to use the existing version of QuickBooks, but within 60-days, it would NO LONGER connect with my bank electronically (I'd be forced to enter all my banking transactions manually).  Well, of course, I was FORCED to upgrade my QuickBooks.  Well, Intuit must have seen how successful this hostage strategy was, because they did the SAME thing with my Quicken - upgrade or don't communicate with ANY financial institutuion.  I'd like to be able to sell a car to the Intuit executives and tell them after 2-years, the car will still run, but you can't lower the windows or turn on the heater.  I've been ripped-off."
1,"2014 TurboTax deluxe, did the job for me mechanically, however the payment system for filing e-file was very complicated.I received my federal tax return in two weeks but I still have not received my state return although I paid over $50 to file them both electronically. I expected much quicker for paying that amount. When calling TurboTax customer care, with all due respect, it was a fiasco. Their customer service program stinks!"
3,"The plain language style questions this software uses makes filling out one's taxes a breeze. I was able to get my taxes done quickly and painlessly.  The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is the fairly outrageous $19.99 additional fee to purchase State e-file (the program comes with a Federal e-file, but not State).  That kind of &#34;upselling&#34; just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  In any case, the program does what I need it to do and still recommend it."
3,"Does a great job for small startups, but as you grow over time you will need to hire a CPA. I am a tech guru and this software is rather basic. There are many ways to prepare taxes, advice that this software should provide, but doesn't.  I only know these things because I used a very high quality CPA last year who makes this software look like garbage.  If you do over $100,000 with your business I recommend getting a CPA. If you do less than $100,000, this software will be perfect for you."
0,"I bought, downloaded and installed this product with no problems.  When I opened it for the first time, I was prompted to register it, which I attempted to do. An email was then sent to me to complete the validation process and when I click on the link I am sent back to the same generic registration page.  After filling out the form again and submitting it I get a message that says I have to validate my email address before I can register. Well, that is what I am trying to do!  A classic circular loop with no successful exit. All support requires registration and a validated email address, so I am unable get help with this problem. This is an Italian company with a local phone number but I cannot make international calls on my phone so I am stuck with a tool I cannot use.  Be aware of the consequences of registration problems if you buy this product."
3,"was able to make back up copies of all my personal DVD. Not really user friendly, but it works."
1,"I used to love avast, it was my favorite virus protection, and no doubt still protects me just as well, but these popups are litterally in the corner of my bloody screen all day. I don't need avast to clean my computer, I have programs to do that. I will update my software when I need to. The worst part is I can't turn them off. I have them set to be quick, but they never go away anyway, I can't even read part of what I'm typing because there is a popup in the corner of my screen."
4,Avast is one of the best anti-virus programs available on the internet.
3,"My wife is a good accountant but she procrastinates when it comes to preparing our taxes.  We've always bought Turbo Tax Premier software because it make the job very easy.  This year she filed an extension and waited until the last day, practically until the last minute to prepare the return.  We went to Best Nuy and several other stores to buy the software but the answer was always \\""We haven't had Turbo Tax for months.\\""  Finally we turned to Amazon and found we could download Turbo Tax online.  I expected the download to take hours, but we were up and running in minutes.  Should we change computers or ever need to download this version again, the software will always be available to us  in Amazon's cloud.<br />This rating is not so much for Turbo Tax, which is very good tax software,  it more for the way we downloaded it diretly from Amazon without the old fashioned disk.<br /><br />This is the way to go.  I will never buy a disk again, if I can download the software from Amazon.<br /><br />I would have given it a five star rating if it was about 20% cheaper."
2,Forced to buy this since my older version stopped being supported.  Essentially Quicken blocked the ability to download updates from my bank until I bought a new version.  Other than that software is still a little touchy and seems to develop issues with account balances ever couple of months.
3,though the results are not pure 3d they are as best as you can get under the circumstances and can happily live with them
0,I am returning this. It does NOT capture transfers between my bank accounts. It did not capture all my bank transactions from the beginning of the year.
4,Excellent
3,"We buy this every year when amazon has it at half or more off.  You have to watch the price daily or so and then simply download it.  First year you use it, may be a little confusing.  But thereafter it picks up your prior year's data no swet and can download all your financials from brokerage houses easily."
3,I had a few issues with trying to download this program but finally got it on my computer.
0,I had a problem with this software using MAC via Amazon. It took two hours to straighten out with a Turbo Tax rep!
3,"I got it when price was $19, and it is easy to download and activate. No need of waiting CD to be shipped."
3,I purchased this online after having problems with speed and other things not working right on my computer.  I've never had a computer get a virus or crash due to one.
1,"I upgraded out of necessity, not desire.  My installation from Q2010 was uneventful.  Everything (I use) seems to be working but I don't like the changes to the budget section.  I liked the \\""weekly, bi-weekly, twice a month, monthly\\"" etc options when entering budget amounts.  I do, however, like the \\""Rollover options.\\""  The bottom line is I'm not happy being forced to upgrade so 2 stars."
4,Great program!
1,"I purchased the Quicken Premier 2014 Download directly from Intuit. Very sorry that I did ! Since theINITIAL download, I have experienced many glitches. There have been numerous updates but none rectify the problems. Updating my accounts, through Quicken, have been a nightmare. Since I began using Quicken in 2003, I have never had my computer &#34;freeze&#34;. It now will do so periodically. Moreover, I have lost data when the Quicken Premier 2014 &#34;freezes&#34;. That is not what I expected from Intuit. To make matters worse, attempting to contact Intuit in a timely manner is impossible. I have experienced &#34;HOLD&#34; times over one (1) hour before I ended the call in frustration. When I have reached a &#34;representative&#34;, I have had difficulty understanding them because they are not fluent in English. Additionally, MANY calls have resulted in attaining poorer results and inferior performance of the program. I would have recommended Quicken in the past, but I, truthfully, seek a more effective and efficient program in the future. PLEASE BEWARE! The Quicken Premier 2014 does not compare to earlier editions. I would have rated the DOWNLOAD with one (1) star, but I have learned &#34;to make lemonade out of this lemon&#34; and have adapted to a disappointing purchase."
4,"I've been using Norton brand security products for a few years and have always been satisfied with the quality of their software. This year with the discontinue of 360, I made the switch to Norton Security with Backup. I am very pleased with it so far. The software window is more streamlined and the software seems to run faster than my old software.<br />The only thing I did have an issue with was on how to download this software. Amazon provides the keycode, but to download the actual software you have to go to the Norton website."
0,"Amazon advertises this product as compatible with an iPad, but it is not.  After purchasing from Amazon, I had trouble using it with my iPad so I contacted Rosetta Stone for support.  They informed me in no uncertain terms that the product is not compatible with iPad and that this is a different product altogether.  Amazon uses deceptive advertising to market this product.  I suggest ordering directly from Rosetta Stone or buying it in a store."
4,"Easiest way to avoid iDVD, great simple editing tool that is easy to learn.  Way more powerful than iMovie and it gets you into a real editor with a future."
3,"It's a tax program and it makes doing taxes easier, There is nothing wrong with the program itself. It's usable, reasonably priced software that's downloadable and I will use it next year as I have for many years past."
2,It's okay.
3,"Quicken 2015 works much like the older versions of Quicken work. The negative for me is that, since it doesn't work with Windows 10, I'll either have to spend yet more the next version of Quicken, or I won't be able to upgrade to Windows 10..."
0,program full of download errors! download issues through microsoft. was on tech support past few days. they said thy are having issues with the program install. i can wait no longer for them to resolve. poor product! cant believe microsoft has simple issues like this without resolving before it gets to amazon. now i am for sure going to mac!
4,"For general-purpose monitoring of all my Internet traffic, Free Avast! is a good choice. Definitions are updated on a regular basis."
2,"since I have purchased this program it has locked my computer up twice, both times I have called quicken I have been transferred too people whose speech was so broken that I could barley understand it  The next thing they start a sales pitch too sell you a program, the only way I can unlock my computer is unplug it  I have had quicken products since 2010 ,this is also putting popups in on A regular basis  thank you  C R Wynn"
1,"I had forgotten that I tried this a few years back so I tried it again.  In spite of the reviews, I found this program to slow my computer and the various warning screens became tedious."
0,"It is frustrating that it doesn't work from the download correctly. It will install and then offer to upgrade. You choices is to either upgrade or quit. When you restart to install the upgrade, it dies. So you are stuck.<br /><br />It seems to be a bum perl script. You can manually launch the upgrade by entering the following into you terminal:<br />/usr/bin/open /Volumes/Rosetta\ Stone\ TOTALe\ 4.5.5\ Update\ 2/Rosetta\ Stone\ TOTALe.pkg"
4,Great Product!! Easy to use.
2,price is good. like turbo tax better but they are to expensive
4,i love Quicken been using it for years in Business as well as for just Personal use.  It is easy
3,"I just downloaded and installed this website creation software.  The first thing I tried to do was install one of their website templates.  I picked one that looked similar to what I thought I would want to use.  Unfortunately, the template was not in English and it was pretty hard to follow.  So I tried another, only to find that NONE of the template examples are in English.  Ok the \\""buttons\\"" like \\""Home\\"", \\""About Us\\"", etc are in English but all the text in the example pages are not in English.  Some looked like French, some looked like Latin.  As a template (or as an example), it was very hard to follow.  Why couldn't they just put the examples in English? Now I'll have to see if I can get my money back.  What a stupid, stupid waste of time!  UPDATE:  Originally, I rated this as a one star but now I've upped it to a four star.  I tried to get my money back, but because I downloaded the software from Amazon, neither Amazon nor Serif would refund my money (so be careful about buying software on Amazon).  BUT it actually worked out for the best.  After I found I couldn't get a refund, I didn't have much choice but to learn the software.  In about 10 days I created what I think is a pretty impressive website (thats working in the evenings and over the weekend, not full-time).  I'm writing this on 6 February 2011, so I started about 10 days ago with zero knowledge on how to create a website.  You can see what I did at [...]  My friends were pretty impressed and I'm pretty happy.  The WebPlus X5 software made it pretty easy, although there are somethings that are very frustrating.  Some things one would think would be easy have been a complete puzzle (I still haven't figured them out).  Some of their \\""Help\\"" and \\""How to\\"" were no help.  On the other hand, the software allowed me to easily do somethings I would have guessed to be very difficult.  In the end, I changed my rating to four-stars.  It did allow me to get the job done, but not without some cussing and a bit of foaming at the mouth.  Lastly, Serif did respond to my complaint about \\""no English templates\\"".  They have a rationale.  Personally, I don't think it is a good one, but I manged anyway.  I do think it would have been easier if the templates had been in English."
3,"Still love Quicken, but this most recent upgrade had and still has some problems. Went from Quicken 2013 to 2014, saved all my data before the upgrade, but somehow in converting the data it lost a bunch of transactions. I have all my bills prepaid within Quicken registers for the next 4 years, after converting, there were at least 25 transactions missing, also, the sync between my home computer and the mobile app does not always sync correctly, the mobile app is still not showing a current correct balance on my savings account, even though the deposit was made and cleared within the register 5 days ago, it still shows the previous balance. It's done this a couple of times and seems to sometimes take up to a week to match up."
0,"So frustrated with this developer and version.  I purchased iBank and ended up having to returning it because it was such a painful experience.  As a software iBank is generally a good replacement for Quicken for Mac. In the past I've given it high praise, that was until version 5.  If, like me you have a large database version 5 makes every save a PAINFUL process. Any time it needs to save (auto or manual), I experience a minimum 10 second hang. Sometime this can happen in the middle of an entry and makes updating my records agravating.  I've spoken to the developer and they acknowledged it was a known regression  in 5.0 (around a year ago).  Now up to version 5.5 they have still not resolved it (I keep checking with each version).  Oh, and the workarounds?<br />-Don't save so often.<br />-Don't create large account files.<br /><br />Well, users need to save to make sure they don't lose data they've entered and I'd rather do this frequently. I also have a large database of accounts because I've had my bank account for years and sometimes need or want to do long term analysis, this doesn't work with 4-5 bank files.<br /><br />At this point, the best I can do is to publicly shame them for not resolving something that worked perfectly in the previous version (4.x).  If you don't need multiple years worth of data available in your file for running reports, go ahead and try iBank.  If like me you actually try to utilize finical software for longer term analysis of your banking steer clear of this version."
4,Absolutely good
2,"Loaded fairly quickly. Computer runs a little slower than before it was installed. Not sure if it is working any better than Microsoft free products like Microsoft defender, security essentials."
3,"It's good to be using Mac for everything, thus I decided to give it a try and spend almost $200. It is slow, and a little buggy, but I am not giving up. You can use Intuit chat on Quickbooks website for simple questions, but forget about real tech support. It's better to type your question, or an error that you get in Quickbooks into Google Search engine. I fixed some problems this way. I am hoping I will be using Quickbooks for Mac, so I don't have to switch back to Windows. If you are not sure, get a free trial first."
4,"I've been using the HRBlock tax software for more than a dozen years, starting back when it was called TaxCut.  I'm happy that it allows me to do my kids taxes and also e-file them without extra charge (up to 5 federal e-filing fees included).  The state fees are not included so we print and mail in the state copies.<br /><br />I've found that buying this online here at Amazon is the best way to go.  HRBlock used to send me copies as a repeat customer but sadly they charged more for me to activate the DVD they sent than a new copy downloaded from Amazon!  I prefer Amazons download service because they include the ability to get your key again and the ability to download it again all for the original price.<br /><br />There are some holds currently due to the Feds not processing certain forms for a few more weeks.  Those mainly apply to things like student deductions and so forth.  The good news is you can still get your taxes ready while they clean up their delays.  The delays are not due to HR Block.<br /><br />Some of the basics I like about the software include these points.  I start by importing the previous year's data so it knows what taxes were paid/returned and how to account for that.  It also prompts for things similar to the year before so you don't miss anything.  I use this for stock option sales, RSU's and other aspects of being an employee who has stock options and RSU's to deal with and it handles all of that nicely.<br /><br />All in all we are very happy with the software.  It can be a pain to move around in the system.  Say you want to get back to a certain place and go through some questions again, since perhaps you only answered them closely but not exactly the first time, you have to step back through sections (such as income or expenses) completely to get there.  It's ok but takes a little time.<br /><br />The videos they provide on training and explaining are helpful and nicely done, I like watching those each year to make sure I stay up on the new laws and features.<br /><br />5 stars as great software package.he new laws and features.<br /><br />5 stars as great software package."
0,"Garmin is perpetrating what might be considered by some to be a scam in their marketing of lifetime map updates. My Nuvi 3590LM, purchased one year ago, included maps for Canada & the US. It also included lifetime map updates (the 'LM' in the model number). The device operated well and as advertised until I was recently notified of a map and software update. When I installed the updates (the first update since I purchased the device a year ago) I was advised on screen that 'Oops', I didn't have enough memory and would either have to purchase an external memory card or reduce the coverage of my device from Canada & the US to a small fraction of that coverage area.<br />Reading the small print on their lifetime map update agreement, I must admit that they have covered their butts quite effectively. In essence, lifetime maps covering the area for which I purchased the GPS (Canada & the US) are only available for the 'useful life' of the device which, apparently, expires when the memory required for the updates exceeds the internal memory. After one year, I have apparently exceeded my memory capacity on the first update!<br />One year seems a terribly short 'useful' lifetime for an electronic device, unless, of course, the goal is planned obsolescence. Had I run into this problem after 3, 4 or 5 years, I would have accepted the issue without much fuss, but twelve months is entirely unacceptable and Garmin has much to answer for. Why, for example, have they not produced a device with sufficient expansion memory to accommodate a few years of growth before their customers hit the memory wall? I would expect as much from a company with such a high profile in the market.<br />I shall be avoiding Garmin products in the future."
3,not sure.but love amazon
3,"I've been using Driver Booster for about a year. During that time, I've taken it &#34;on faith&#34; that it was finding and updating my old drivers. I have, however, always wondered if it was finding ALL of my old drivers. Yesterday, I decided to test that. I first ran a DB scan, which updated a couple of minor drivers, then went to Intel's driver site, installed the &#34;auto-detect&#34; utility and ran it. It confirmed what I had suspected. I had a version 10 Intel graphics driver. The latest update was version 15 -- 5 versions past the one I had.  Something to consider about this program: When you get notification of an available update, notice the date of the old vs. the new driver (it's on the DB screen). I often find that the &#34;new&#34; driver was actually released many months ago (one of them yesterday was available last July!). It was this observation that caused me to wonder if DB was finding ALL old drivers... and got me to consider the amount of man hours it would take to collect and install in DB ALL OF THE DRIVERS FOR ALL OF THE HARDWARE IN ALL THE WINDOWS COMPUTERS IN THE WORLD! The shear enormity and cost of that task makes it unlikely that DB (which is FREE) is going to update ALL of your old drivers. Despite that, will I continue using it? Yes. It is still a more convenient way to keep MOST of your drivers updated.  Update 7/15/15: I'm having 2nd thoughts about using DB because of an incident yesterday. DB said I needed a new Intel graphics 4600 driver, so I installed that update. I then went to Intel's driver update site and used their utility to tell me what, if any, driver updates I needed. It said I needed the Intel &#34;Pro&#34; graphics update. Thinking that was perhaps another part of the total graphics system, I installed it. I then did another scan with DB. Guess what? It AGAIN showed that I needed to update the Intel graphics 4600 driver. IOW, the Intel update had replaced what DB had just installed, and after that, DB said I needed toupdate it. The question here is who do you most trust to tell you what drivers you need: The driver manufacturer (Intel) or a Chinese utility with no association with Intel? I go with Intel. For that reason, I have uninstalled DB from both of my computers."
3,"I guess if you wait long enough the product eventually gets fixed.  I upgraded from 2012 to 2013 because the price was half in Amazon then it was to get from Quicken.  I was pissed when I bought 2012 and they rolled about 2013 shortly afterwards without a fair upgrade policy.  Then I saw all the issues, and said \\""thank god\\"".  A few posts recently made me decide to try it.  My version is R10  or 22.10.2.  The upgrade was flawless.  Quicken mobile is working perfect.<br /><br />MY ONLY BEEF?  WTF Quicken, where's the  64-bit support?  Everytime I launch I get the \\""Either theris no default mail or current client cannot fulfill the messaging request\\""...  I'm running MS-Office 2013 Pro Plus  64-bit\\"", so your app doesn't support 64-bit Outlook????  Other than that works perfectly.... finally.<br /><br />27 Feb 13 - Update:  The 64-bit problem is only a problem if you have the \\""sync to outlook\\"" feature checked.  Which I suspect would affect user who have the Quickbooks or invoicing features\\"".<br /><br />One thing that is a VAST improvement over earlier editions is the online bank sync.  With 2012, I could never get it to work with NavyFederal or my Wells Fargo Mortgage, I have to say now it does it all pretty well.  I get my credit cards, my loans (car and mortgage) and the mobile app works flawlessly too.  Tonight I got a new Version 11 update, and it sync'd a bit better.  Overall, I think Quicken finally has resolved it's major flaws in this version."
2,Might be better if my memory was better as by the time I need the info I can get it quicker off the internet.
0,Quicken for 2015 is a piece of garbage.  Connecting to accounts that worked in Windows versions no longer work in Mac 2015. Cost basis changes or is recorded as zero in some cases.  POOR POOR POOR product.  Intuit should be ashamed of themselves.
3,Great for e-filing tax returns. Especially for more complex returns.
1,Product not as advertised.  Will not work of Surface tablets.  Very little info appears on mobile devices.  Definitely not worth the update cost.
4,Poor. Junk.
4,Amazing tool. I use it to edit videos for team. It is great for novices.
2,I don't think that the product was ready for distribution.  On a positive note Quicken has put out several updates but there is more to do.  I think that if Quicken had serious competition they would either improve or die on the vine.  I have been using Quicken for over ten years and yet continue to upgrade nearly every year in spite of the short comings.
2,"I bought this to compare to Tax Cut-absolutely no difference, advantages or savings to Tax Cut.  So not disappointed or writing a negative review, just that Tax Cut hooked me first and no reason to switch to new software for taxes."
2,"Have not used it that much but what I have use it for has worked just fine. It does take a while to load,."
0,Really awful.<br />Cannot remove 'Tools Pane' on every start up of every document you open. It takes up half the screen and is not only annoying but very unnecessary. Wait to see if adobe fixes this. If not try something else or use an older version.
1,"I upgraded because support was being discoutinued for my previous version.  I have very simple business accounting requirements and do not need or use the new functionality contained in the upgrade.  I find the upgrade to have fancier looking screens, but they are less efficient to use than my previous version.  Most of the input screens I use have a reduced data input and viewing area to provide room for fancy graphics and colors.  This results in slower data input due to having to scroll to access input fields that were displayed in the my previous version.  The same scrolling is required for final review of data input prior to posting entries.  My overall opinion is the upgrade is more show than substance and, for my applications, is more time consuming to use."
1,Have used Turbo Tax for over 10 years.....this was the worst version I have ever seen!  Interface for Schedule D horrible.<br />Might be my last year using them
4,"This software is easy and user friendly, I have been using it for a lot of years, and will continue"
1,"The JVC GR-DV800U could not be found and thus could not be installed. The program did know it was a GR-DV800 but even using Windows Update it was unable to locate drivers for this. Had this worked I would probably have paid for the full pro version. As it stands now, what I did pay $0.00 is all its worth. Maybe if they can find the drivers and let me know that would be nice. Can't test it beyond this point.<br />If you have the JVC GR-DV800U = this is not what you are in need of to get the files off the miniDV tape using USB cable."
2,"It says easy to use,I am finding it is difficult and confusing to use and is NOT user friendly. It is a struggle just to get it to do what you think it should."
1,"NOT RETINA compatible. I was a user of the Elements 11 and I gave Adobe a pass for not updating it for retina capable Macs due to the timing of release and the new Macs. I purchased 12 thinking it had been over a year and the Retina Macs are more prevalent and they would have had the foresight to support it... wrong.  Everything is pixelated, especially the text and tools. It looks awful. Shame on you Adobe, I was really looking forward to some of the new features here."
3,I use a fiscal year ending June 30.<br />Turbo tax handled it very well.<br />Found and corrected errors.<br /><br />I have already purchased TurboTax Business 2012 to do this years taxes.<br />Would recommend to a small business owner.
2,"I have had a myriad of problems with this product. So much so that I have abandoned the software and purchased Toast 11. The software is hit or miss. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Tech support is a nightmare. You have to tweet them on Twitter which is useless because of Twitter's message length limitation or you have to create an account on their website, submit a &#34;ticket&#34; of the problem. The Tech support does not read your complaints carefully, because they offer canned responses that are almost word-for-word quotes from the support articles you get from the product FAQs online.  I have written very detailed complaints of what solutions of I have tried to get their software to work. They will simply offer a canned solution that I have already done and detailed in my complaint. This is happens almost every time I have tried to get help from them--they do not read my complaint and only offer canned solutions that you can get from the FAQ. Or they suggest you try another software product BUT they only give you the trial version which does not do all of the things of the purchased version, so what help is that? You end up very frustrated because their Tech Support talks in circles. I don't believe these people know the software product very well but are trained to continuously give canned responses instead of actually reading what the problem is and offering an actual solution that works.<br /><br />Problems I had with this software: When I tried to burn a DVD, it kept stalling at 49%. So I tried to create an ISO file and that kept stalling at 89%. Tech support could not offer any solution other than for me other than to try another one of their software packages. They gave me the link, however--IT IS ONLY A TRIAL VERSION, so I would have to pay more money to these people to get a software that may  or may not work as well. Also--try downloading DVD creators from Aimersoft and Aieesoft. It's the exact same software as Wondershare!! The look and even the features are exactly the same as Wondershare's which leads me to believe all these companies are owned by the same people. And all these softwares will have the same problems as well.  Don't buy any Wondershare products unless you want to end up frustrated and $39.00 poorer.<br /><br />UPDATE: I am eligible for free updates, and Wondershare has made good attempts to improve the software and fix the bugs. I find now I can make DVDs a bit easier with this software, though it is still slow. One caveat is to not go over the amount the DVD can hold. Supposedly this software will compress the data if it's more than the disc's capacity, but that feature does not work. I ended up with coasters. With each upgrade, this software has improved to the point where I use it fairly regularly. Sometimes the DVDs play with pixelations, so it's not quite there yet.exactly the same as Wondershare's which leads me to believe all these companies are owned by the same people.

3,"Hancom Office 2010 SE is compatible with both Microsoft Office and Libre (Open) Office. However, importing .doc or .docx documents is much faster and shows better results than importing .odt documents. Editing .ods spreadsheets might cause problems with other office suites (OpenOffice might not be able to open the document -- in this case use Gnumeric to repair it).  The user interface is very clean and can emulate either Microsoft Office 2003 (with old-style menus) or Microsoft Office 2010 (with ribbons).  Full Screen Reading hides most of the user interface, but when you select an object like numbered lists, pictures, or tables, a toolbar pops up.  In addition to standard features, messaging services like Facebook and Twitter are supported. PDF export is available, too.  Some people found security vulnerabilities in Hancom Office. The manufacturer responded with an update tool which adds new features as well.  ***  I love Hancom Office 2010 SE. Concerning my home country (Germany), it is sad that German date and number formats are not supported. If you can live with U. S. equivalents, this should be a useful and affordable office suite. It works on my Windows XP and Windows 7 computers."
3,Nice
4,"Based only on the ease of downloading and opening the App, I give it 5 stars.  I'm writing this because several reviewers apparently had problems downloading and installing the App.  I'm running Yosemite on a Mac Pro and it couldn't have been smoother.  I'll update this review when I've had a chance to use it for a while."
4,I have used this software for more than a year. It runs great. I use it daily and rely on MalwareBytes for an occasional<br />double check.
3,I am only using the checking capability of Quicken so it is hard for me to comment on overall program.<br /><br />I have been using Quicken since 1989 and would not do my checking account any other way.
0,"I have used TurboTax for many years and have considered it to be a good product. There have been changes made this year that have made me change my mind. First, if you are a Mac user you will not be able to print without using Intuit's Print Service, which means that if you use it offline you cannot print. Second, their customer service people are incompetent."
4,Great product and value!
0,"Purchased a download copy of PSE 10 from Amazon on 5/18/12.  I'd been using a download copy of PSE 8 that I'd purchased directly from Adobe in 10/09.  Didn't really need the upgrade, but the price (50% off) was too good to pass up.  All properly registered and on file in \\""my products and services\\"" at Adobe.com.<br /><br />In 10/12 I upgraded my HDD to a SSD and did a fresh install of my OS (Win7 64) and all software.  My copy of PSE 10 installed OK but when I tried to activate it my serial number was rejected.  I triple checked everything to make sure I was using the correct serial number.  I was.<br /><br />I went to customer support at Adobe looking for help.  The *only* way to get help without paying is via live chat.  I had a similar problem with a reinstall of my earlier version that was handled fairly easily, and expected a similar result this time.  Wrong!!!<br /><br />The CSR I connected with jumped me through some trouble shooting steps, that I'd already taken before connecting with him.  He asked for the serial number.  He told me I needed to put the disc in the optical drive.  Told him it was a download version.  He insisted it was a disc version and I needed to put the disc in the optical drive.  Told him that I had no disc, and sent him a link to my digital order at Amazon.  He continued to insist that I put the non-existent disc in the optical drive.  We were in a useless circular discussion.  I asked him what was next?  He offered to give the link so I could pay for the software.  I disconnected without writing some of the words I most certainly would have said had I had him on the phone.  That support case still shows as \\""withdrawn\\"" on my Adobe account.<br /><br />I build, configure, troubleshoot, and repair my own systems, and have done so for years.  I rarely need technical support.  When I do, I expect better access and treatment than Adobe provides it's paying customers.<br /><br />The program itself is quite good.  But it has very few features/functions that can't be found in some very good freeware photo editing/management software, and none that I can't live without.  In fact some of the freeware programs are actually better in some respects, like configurability of the user interface, less use of system resources, etc.<br /><br />All vestiges of Adobe has been removed from my systems.  Don't even use their free PDF reader.<br /><br />You've been warned.<br /><br />Update 2/14/14:<br /><br />Kudos to Brett N from Adobe (see comments attached to this review).  After receiving my support case number via private email he investigated, to include reviewing the transcript of my exchange with the CSR.  He acknowledged the matter was mishandled and said he was referring it to the manager of the CSR.<br /><br />I'm confident that if Brett N had been on the other end of my chat the problem would have been taken care of and I'd still be a happy Adobe user.  He wasn't...I'm not.  And won't be until they change their policy to allow at least a limited number of free telephone support contacts to registered users."
4,"I have been a faithful Quicken for Windows user for over 25 years.  I tried Quicken Essentials for Mac some years ago and hated it.  It was an albatross.  I downloaded and began using Quicken for Mac 2015 when it came out.  Within days I wiped the Boot Camp for Windows off my Mac.  This program is great.  Pretty intuitive for any one who plays with new software now and again.  I'm totally Mac now.  Not going back!<br /><br />Thanks Intuit.<br /><br />Craig from Lexington, KY"
2,Got the Creative Toolbox 5 thinking that this would unlock a lot of the potential of my soundblaster audio card but didn't give me much in the ways that the old Windows XP drivers did...so spent a lot odf money for nothing. Maybe in hindsight should of spent the money on a new better supported sound card.
2,"This product is okay, however, it is not user friendly. For someone who may not have much computer/office experience, they may find this is too difficult to use. Also you cannot send finished projects via email in the way you would through MS Office. Overall it did help me out of a jam many of times."
1,"I was happier with the old version. This version my have good features, but the easy things are harder to do."
1,"I bought the download version from Amazon.  Later, I learned I needed to upgrade to the Home/Business version.  But there was one small catch-- I needed a confirmation number, which was not provided with my download.  When I attempted to contact TT support, I was placed in a queue lasting several hours.  When I finally got a call-back, I was placed on hold and then lost in cyberspace as someone passed me down the line.  So, now 2 days later, I haven't a confirmation number and I can't upgrade.  So, no matter how generous TT's offer to provide 'free' upgrades for what used to be a standard part of the Deluxe version, it makes it very difficult/impossible to actually get the support necessary to take advantage of that offer"
1,"Although the video part is done nicely, I must make clear this tutorial is for the absolute beginner. If you have the basics of accounting under your belt, or have already read some of the 2012 Intuit downloadable Mac manual, this \\""training\\"" video is not for you. If you're looking for something a bit more in-depth, this doesn't fill the bill. Given the fact that Intuit has provided a pretty extensive manual online for free, I recommend saving your bucks for the accountant when you need him or her. The downloadable manual is not ideal, but I can tolerate a bit of imperfection when I haven't been pinched in the pocketbook.<br /><br />This video is broken down into chapters, with various short clips (averaging around 2 minutes each) highlighting the most important features, such as creating a basic invoice, making a payment, and depositing money in your bank account. I don't want to be completely negative, but the tutorial is so basic, (i.e. \\""Reconciling your bank account is one of the most important tasks in QuickBooks\\"" or \\""Doing regular backups can save you lots of time in case of computer problems\\""), that one would have to be a newbie to everything business-related to appreciate this training module.<br /><br />I also want to mention that this tutorial is not done by Intuit, but by a company called Real World Training out of Dallas, TX. I can't be 100% certain, but I believe this version here on Amazon is the same training CD they offer on their website for $100 + $20 shipping! When I called the company to find out if they offered a downloadable version of their QB for Mac training CD, I was told they do not. Hmm.<br /><br />With that said, well . . . need I say more?"
0,it sucks i just pay 20 dlls for this and in the pic say is 4 1 year and am only get 15 days trial somebody can tell me what to do?[[ASIN:B0060C3AG8 Norton AntiVirus 2012 1User  [Download]]]
2,"The product seems to have a number of nice features.  But even with the 'how-to' videos it seems difficult to use.  I work with computers for a living so I'm not computer illiterate.  Then there's the issue of support.  When I installed it, it wanted me to shut down my firewall so that it could have unfettered access.  Come on!  In this day and age of automated bots looking for open ports every few seconds, who in his right mind wants to lower his firewall protection to install an application?  Why should we have to?  Anyway, I didn't, and the application had a problem 'calling home' to activate itself.  I immediately put in a support request.  It was a Friday at 6:00pm, their support is only open weekday 'banker hours'.  I hoped I'd hear back from them at least by the following Monday.  I didn't.      I finally, by myself found the right combination of firewall tweaks to let it get through.  Either that or something on their end cleared up; I'll never know which it was.  It activated and, other than the learning curve I mentioned, seems to work OK.  Oh, and I didn't hear back on my support ticket until Tuesday: four days after I put the support ticket in.  Not exactly impressive showing of consideration for the customer.      The product gets three stars.  The company would get one."
1,"After the TaxAct program finished installing on my computer there was an odd executable file on my desktop named Vosteran.exe.  Luckily I know that virus' are spread with executable files so I did not double-click on it.  Instead did a little research online first.  Turns out this is a Trojan Horse virus and it was embedded in the TaxAct install file.  I deleted the Vosteran file then went into the Recycle Bin & deleted it from there. My computer seems to be ok but it could have been serious.  Vosteran.com is a notorious redirect virus that has attacked countless computers so far. By modifying Windows browser settings, this hijacker forcedly substitutes for your default homepage and tries to inject its malicious codes into the affected machine. Thus, you’re not surprised to be pointed to Vosteran.com and receive lots of insecure pop-up advertisements which designed to help cyber schemers to generate illicit revenue from those computer victims. Meanwhile, the compromised system will be running extremely sluggish, sometimes unavailable"
4,have used this product for 10 years and it has always been reliable.  Best software in the business for home tax preparation.
3,"I was expecting to be disappointed, but was pleasantly surprised.  I'd been struggling with iBank and finally gave up because of a lot of reasons, but especially because it's reporting is non-existent.  I used Quicken PC in a virtual PC environment, but that was so painfully slow.  This version of Quicken for Mac is not as good as the PC version, but is much better than anything else I've tried on the Mac, plus it's fast."
3,"After the long download time, you have to go to Adobe's website to validate. I didn't know this until after I called Amazon when getting started wasn't happening. If you have a .edu email address, use that so you will get validated immediately. If you don't have one, I've read that it takes longer. Product is expensive for even a student/teacher edition. But it could be worse."
2,okay..
3,"Helped me get my taxes done quickly, but I have been using TurboTax for almost 20 years and so am very familiar with it.  The Help portion did not seem as extensive as it used to be.  It used to be that when you searched for something you had a question over, you would be directed to IRS pubs that may help.  This time I was directed to discussion forums involving customers answering other customers' questions."
4,Works great
2,"I purchased this card program as a replacement for American greetings create-a-card 3. Which will not work on my windows 7 64 bit O.S.? As most people know once you find a card program it is hard to find a replacement one that does Cards the way you like. I found this program very hard to do a quick personalized card, And the card size that I was used to using, It does work and has a lot of other gadgets that I don't use but I can make cards if I plan ahead as it will take an hour instead of just 5 min compared to my old program. And be prepared for doing your cards over a few times as it does not always print the same way depending on what card you make. I am not real happy with this card program and if you do the down load don't download the complete program as it will never finish, there is no download manager to continue were you leave off form.  You will have to do it right from the beginning only to have it stop and try all over again. My advice buy the disk don't download."
1,"As many others have, I bought Quicken Essentials in a panic when I discovered Quicken 2004 didn't run on OSX Lion. Converting the 2004 data to the QE format was more cumbersome than necessary, BUT that wasn't the worst part. Intuit has created a proprietary data format, .qxf, that cannot be exported to any other software using standard formats such as .qif. The Intuit one liner is \\""Quicken Essentials no longer supports qif. So if you buy QE, know that in all probability you will not be able to move your data to some other program.  I'd recommend before going to QE to explore other software that uses non-proprietary formats."
1,"I've been using Turbo tax for many yrs and have been ok with it. This year I am aggravated for many reasons. :  1. I usually buy the Deluxe version- but this year they changed it so it's not the one I need- thanks for not alerting your past customers!  2. There are many things that come up that are not understandable to the average home preparer.  3. On the review section I got 4 corrections 2 of which I had no idea where the error was, nor how to fix it- The error section should tell you where to find it.  4. When I got to the State section- the software has a glitch where it gets stuck in a loop of downloading and it never loads.    Next year I am looking for another means to do this."
0,This thing wont work because it wont take the code.  They even issued a new one and the same thing.  I finally just gave up and lost my 70+ $.  I would stay clear if you are looking at this.   Addition to review is now two years later it is no longer there for me to try it again and still lost $$$$$$$
3,I have used turbo tax for many years. Works great.
0,"I have no problem with an application being configured to utilize a connection to my finances that I configure. When the software requires you to log into an account that has NOTHING TO DO WITH MY Financial institution with no way to out of that piece of functionality (YES, intuit/Quicken I am talking to you) it does not bring security to the forefront of my brain. It's been uninstalled, and a work around has been managed so that Quicken 2011 works just fine.<br />intuit Customer lost."
3,Really like it but having trouble getting my song into it.  Usually I get it there by accident.<br />Thank you
4,"This was so easy to use. I usually have H & R Block complete my taxes, this year I tried the tax software. Was a great experience. No stress or fuss, simple, easy to understand instructions. Guides you to what information you need and where to find it on the W2. Bonus didn't need a state and federal--All-in-one:)"
1,I THINK IT WAS DISGRACEFULL HOW YOU MARKETED TURBO-TAX THIS YEAR.  BY CUTTING OUT THE CRITICAL FORMS FOR ITEMIZING DEDUCTIONS AND THEN ADDING THEM BACK IN WHEN YOU WERE PRESSURED BY THE PUBLIC AND PRESS.  I WILL NOT BUT TURBO-TAX NEXT YEAR.
1,"I was forced to buy Quicken 2013 because they would no longer allow my Quicken 2010 to download from my bank.  This program is not nearly as good as 2010 as others have observed but it is the only game in town.  Started out with problems in forcing registration.  Had to call Intuit India to get help to get rid of the registration screen.  The changes are more designed to help Intuit sell more loans and other things than to provide a quality program.  This thing is not as good as 2010 and it was not as good as Quicken 2008.  If they think they are being intuitive in data entry and handling, they must be on another planet.  This is really bad but.... until something else comes along it is the only game in town."
1,"Last year my TurboTax included the State filing forms, but this year I had to pay an extra $44 for the forms then $19.99 to file electronically.  I wasn't expecting this.  Also my electronic check never got to the Feds and I had to pay by check through the mail.  Very disappointed in TurboTax!!!"
1,Only the US version was available online. Tried to import files from previous versions but the UK version file format is incompatible with the US version file format - so left unable to use the new version!
3,"Mango is text and sound based learning so I would not recommend it for those who are seeking to learn a language from scratch.  That said, the material is extensive and the price reasonable.  There are many interesting colloquialisms and cultural notes.  If you are acquainted with French already and wish to get back into the groove, Mango French 3 is a great bargain."
1,I upgraded from Vegas Movie Studio 11 to 13.<br />After a few runs with 13 I went back to the older Version 11.<br />13 was sluggish and crashed frequently.
3,still setting it up. Seems like it will be very useful.
1,It was NOT clear that ALL 10 must be installed at the same time. VERY disappointed. The year clock begins with the FIRST install. Each one thereafter is good for less than a year depending on WHEN it gets installed. I hope they read this and respond.
2,"It SUCKs that I can't print out state form.  Use to be with Turbo Tax free federal you didn't have to pay for the state form, just print it out (all filled in, that was nice).  Then address an envelope to the state, add a stamp you state taxes files.  FOR THE COST OF A STAMP.<br /><br />NOT NOW, I say CORPORATE GREED is the problem.<br /><br />I don't think I will purchase turbo tax next year."
3,I haven't had much time to spend with it yet..but so far it looks great!
2,"Having used Quicken since 1991, I have upgraded Quicken every year since my initial introduction to Quicken.  I have seen good years and bad years.  2012 was not a particularly good year.  I read so much negative about 2013, it was the first year I ever skipped updating Quicken.  I decided to wait a year since they moved all development to India.<br /><br />Intuit management considers Quicken no longer to be a strategic product as evidenced that it is not even mentioned in the corporate annual report.  They are doing all they can to move people to Mint.com.  I will never ever move to a &#34;cloud based&#34; personal financial solution & would highly discourage people from doing so.  Accessing my banking via the web is one thing since I can't much influence their privacy and security controls.  Having 20+ years of my personal financial data sitting in some unknown location totally outside my control is beyond what I would ever feel comfortable with.  (Won't use their cloud based tax solutions either.)<br /><br />The 2014 edition of Quicken Premier routinely prompts you to get you to use their &#34;mobile app&#34;.  Note it uses their cloud solution.  Won't ever use it!  Thus it is on zero value to me.  I was hoping it would connect to my PC based DB via my wireless network, but no such luck.<br /><br />As of late December 2014, the 2014 edition is still buggy.  Screens freeze, data lines are weird at times, runs more slowly than 2012, etc.  It may be that I am still on Windows XP SP3, but that has never been an issue in the past.  One can only hope they fix the reliability issues before 2015 comes out."
3,"I am a long time Norton user and though I find it to be an memory hog, I trust Norton.<br /><br />Over the years I have discovered that if you autorenew your existing license, you will pay the full amount.  If you buy a new license, every year, not only can you change the computers on which Norton is downloaded, which you can't if you autorenew, you generally pay $30 to $50 dollars less by purchasing, downloading and installing new software. Moral of this story is never autorenew, autoupgrade, autoanything when it comes to computer software."
1,"Just as Ryan White described, I had the same issue installing the language packs. I think I figured it out after several tries. After you download and install the program and start up for the first time, it will prompt you to install and update. DON'T DO THIS. It looks like this update changes the file location and then the language levels can't be found when you restart the program. If you already installed the update (like I did), you can install the older version by going into the ProgramFiles (PC) and looking for a Setup file in the folder with &#34;TOTALe&#34; in the name. You should now have 2 Rosetta Stone shortcuts on your desktop. Open/install the &#34;TOTALe&#34; one, skip the update, and the languages should install automatically after that.<br /><br />I'm typing this as the languages are installing, so I don't know if this will work completely, but hopefully it does."
3,"I'm used to Norton Anti-virus software for a PC and Intego Mac Internet Security 2013 seems very elementary, in comparison. It was highly rated, so that's why I purchased it. I'm sure it will perform as advertised."
2,real good for free
1,"If you are coming from the Windows version, be prepared to go through a bit of hassle to get your data over. Also I could not download all transactions from my bank and had to manually enter a bunch of them which took a while. Please read the issues posted at Intuit site regarding the mac version before purchasing. They are improving the software at a slow pace but it looks like it could be resolved in the 2016 version by the time they are done :-("
0,"I thought I had to purchase the 2012 version since I've used this the past few years without problems and wanted last year's info to download.  The first problem - it wouldn't recognize last year's return, so I had to start from scratch.  The info doesn't flow between forms, some of the time you must guess where to click because the buttons don't line up with the statements, the state corporate forms are terrible - nothing populates correctly from the federal form, and after moving among several forms, the program encounters a problem and must quit.  So you must save your return every time you make a change or you'll lose your info.  Next year I'll purchase a different tax program."
1,"This year's software did not meet my expectations.<br />a) It did not import some entries from my last year's return file (also H&R At Home).<br />b) It did not give me good guidance on the taxable/non-taxable portion of last year's state refund.<br />c) It did not import tax documents from one of my brokerage account.<br />d) It did not recognize some entries from my imported W-2, as state taxes paid.<br /><br />BTW, TurboTax did all the above right!"
1,&#34;Virtually&#34; useless
3,"I had previously used IYogi last year but I had problems reaching them after I had paid the money. I am not a techie at all. I am a better than  average novice having gone back to school after retiring and learning Word on the fly and dabbled with Excel and a program for Statistics SPSS.<br />So, why PC works or not, runs slow or not or any of the aggravating problems that can be linked to the user vs viruses, cookies, etc. I can not really say. I do know that so far, (a few months) ,PC Matic has worked well and typical download averages are good. I also use the apartment's WiFi and it is not as fast as a homeowners private service. I know that the price was excellent and does what other services charge for about a third of the other services. The reason I did not rate PC Matic 5 stars is because of the relative short time I have been using it. If things are still working great  this time next year I will be glad to give it 5 stars."
1,"The Dragon software itself is great, but it comes with an update installer that you cannot turn off or uninstall and which tries to download updates almost daily.  The update installer is more like malware than legitimate software.  It bogs down my computer's system."
2,My only complaint is the lack of ID verification with the IRS.  My return was delayed several weeks while the IRS did an IDVERIFY by letter on my return to verify I was the actual owner of the Tax Return and Refund.  You need a much better system of verifying Tax Returns so the IRS doesn't think people are committing Identity Theft on their own return.
0,"Beware.  I've used Norton Antivirus exclusively for about eight years now, but this year's version has a big problem if you use encryption:  It will cause hard stops, the blue-screen-of-death if you try to run either TrueCrypt or any other form of file or disk encryption.  Until Symantec fixes this problem I would avoid Norton security products if there's any chance you will use encryption software"
2,Our family all use Turbo Tax for family returns. What a surprise when the fourth return cost more to California E-file than the previous three. Not fair. Intuit has gotten too cocky with dropping some of the forms and making you move to higher level. They backed off but why even try to pull that fast one on all your customers.
3,"Works well and makes filling out overly complex tax forms possible.  Given our insane tax laws, with all the gimmicks for taxes and deductions, it helps navigate these complexities.  I will buy it again, For you progressives who preach higher taxes, simply do not fill in any of the allowed deductions, thereby maximizing your tax bill and advancing your political cause."
2,"Old glitches not fixed, new glitches added.  Sigh.  And who misspelled \\""scheduled?\\""<br /><br />When I download items from a bank or other account, it is having trouble matching--that is, it says there are two things it could match, but the first one is an error, something from a year or two ago, or something that doesn't even exist--Quicken made it up!!  It makes it take longer for me to check my downloads.<br /><br />When I tell it to do an update, I get a message that the password is wrong.  It isn't.  And I click on OK, and it does the update.  Just another extra step for me for no reason.<br /><br />And I'm sure there will be more problems, the more I use it.<br /><br />Also, the Help doesn't seem as good as it used to.<br /><br />Is this enough for now?"
3,"For the most part, this is a very good tool.  It does take some time to learn nuances, and it does have some limitations in this lower cost version. I am on Win 8 and it works fine.<br /><br />For example, roof structure is pretty much forced to free framed roof and ceiling joists. If you want to do trusses, you need to upgrade to a more expensive version.<br /><br />There are also some quirks that require playing time to learn, but that's pretty typical of software.<br /><br />I had purchased a cheaper version from another company and it was near worthless by comparison.<br /><br />so yes, there is a cost to this product, and yes it takes time to learn, but in my view, it's worth it, and fairly priced.  I gave it 4 stars since there are some capability gaps that require a fairly spendy upgrade."
2,The mobile extra's are not worth the upgrade. they eliminated some options we used. Its just OK  I wish we would not have upgraded
2,"I like QuickBooks I have used it for both my businesses for years. But there payroll is gotten to expensive for a small business . I have about 15 employees  I bought this version of quickbooks with payroll software. After  a month  they charged me a $494.00 payroll update fee. I thought it came with the first year payroll update but apparently not. I called to ask about it, cause it used  to include the first year with it, and it used to be about 250.00 a year. So check out other options like peach tree or just having your accountant do your payroll it may save some money and time"
2,"Much the same as my 2010 version. The only reason to get it is that quicken will stop supporting it with our banks<br />the end of this April and had no choice but to purchase it. 2013 works fine, but nothing special."
0,"Complete piece of s(&t that barely works on an iMac. This program crashes every day, multiple times. In a 2 hour period, I've had it crash 20 times. In the last 15 minutes, the program has crashed 8 times. This is the only option I have to do my work and it doesn't even work. And it loses most of the stuff I marked up on documents, which makes me look bad professionally, like really damaging because it makes me look sloppy and inaccurate, which are REALLY top priorities for my job. If I lose work because of a bug with this problem, Adobe should reimburse me for the thousands I stand to lose."
3,"The performance seems to have improved from previous versions.  Not a bad price for performance ratio.  I would recommend it, however, perhaps a review and comparison of Kaspersky is also a good idea..."
4,"We personally really like Avast for all our computer virus protection needs. It catches most things, We just have a malware program detector running to, to be safe"
1,"I have used Turbo Tax for a few years now and have liked it, that is why I have continued to use  it.  It installed easily.  I appreciate how I am able to import information from my previous year return, saving me time by not needed to enter that information again.  I also like the 5 Fed. e-filings  that are included for no extra charge.  But I do think the $19.95 charge for e-filing my state return is a little excessive, and I might give it a better rating if State E-file were also included or maybe even for a lesser cost.<br />I understand, there are going to be updates periodically, but wish each update would be more complete and that they could come less often.<br />I understood, this program could be installed on more than 1 PC.  I wanted to have it on my laptop, along with my desktop.  This comes with 1 State download of my choice, but when I installed it on my second machine, they wanted to charge me to install the State on my second machine. This is the first year this has happened  I felt like the program passed over some of the things I required, and I needed to know what to do, so I could manually enter the information.<br />I think I will look for a different product to use next year."
3,"You can't be free. It works nicely. However, I wish they would stop hounding me with sales pitches for the paid version, and requests to review their app."
4,I have been using this software for years never had an issue.
1,This addition to Quicken would not absorb my quicken 2003 into it. So I had to pay a I-tech geek $99.00 to incorporate all of my old files into this new quicken.  And it was all because my NEW computer wouldn't download my old Quicken..... Go figure....
3,"Very nice but, malwarebytes found more viruses."
0,I've been a Turbotax user since 1999 but I will never use it again.  It works fine for tax software.  My issue is that the company has made it their stand that they will not work with or provide their services to firearm related companies.  I know several that have had Intuit shut down their services with zero notice leaving them without the ability to process credit card purchases.  I'd rather buy from a company that isn't anti-second ammendment.
2,"Yep, they changed the interface, but with a little hunting you can change it back to the more familiar and less cluttered look from previous versions.<br /><br />This is just Intuit doing their normal thing ... buy new or we won't let you use our Payroll service. This is one greedy company."
4,I'm very satisfied with the product..
3,"Good interface, solid results. I have used some of the competitors and found this to be the easiest to use."
3,"I only want to use Quicken as a check register.  I have used Quicken on Windows (when it installed off a diskette in the early years) up through my switching to Mac (for the last 10+ years.)  I was happy with the installation, with the linking to their Credit Union checking accounts, and with the ease I had transitioning from the old software I was comfortable with to the new version.  That said, I have not used it enough to rate it much past a check register software.  So far, so good."
1,Three years ago I bought this for a trust return and it couldn't import brokerage 1099 and IT STILL CAN'T. A trust makes a lot of trades and putting it in by hand after paying over $100 for this tax software is ridiculous. Also there is no place for co-trustees - I had to put one trustee in the first name with &#34;and&#34; - then 2nd trustee in last name. Shame on Turbo Tax for such obvious big shortcomings.<br />Look at H&R Block or if you are familiar with these returns taxsoftware.com
2,"I was happy to get this free and available from Amazon.  My son the programmer has told me about this product for several years.  Initially I thought it would work fine for me, but it got to be a hassle.  It's very similar to all the Windows Office programs I'm used to.  it opened all my old files.  (When I bought a new computer I could not find my old Office disk)  Documents (Word) was pretty straight forward.  However spreadsheets (Excel) were different enough that they were hard to use.  The on-line help is really poor and difficult to use.  While I applaud the group doing this, I finally broke down and ordered a used Windows 2003 disk used on here.  Never done that before, but it worked fine."
1,"Please don't make the same mistake I did. I read the reviews, but still thought I could make it work.  I was wrong.  $79 down the drain.  Don't waste your money.  Get another product, or pay they money and let someone do your taxes for you.  Bait and switch. TurboTax is a TurboRip-off that's get worse every year."
0,I was audited for 2011 and contacted H&R Block.  It was a waste of time.  The first call had no idea how to help me and I hung up and redialed to get a different rep.  This one barely spoke English.  He final solution was for me to call the IRS and work it out with them.<br />Forget any audit support.
0,"I have been using Quicken since MS-DOS days.  I love the online banking feature; so I have used several of the Quicken versions as you are forced to upgrade about every 3 years to maintain this feature.  I have always thought the program was good and at times . . . great software.  However, 2014 Deluxe is poor at best.  I have experienced lots of bugs and glitches.  The application locks up or starts asking me questions about accounts that I have had inactive for years.  When it does this, I have to close out and restart.  When using Quicken 2014, I back-up before and after each use - to two separate files as I am worried it will lose/corrupt my data.  To be fair, this has not actually happened but I do not have any level of confidence that it would not.<br /><br />It is entirely possible I may have a unique issue caused by my hardware, transfer of data from previous versions, overall data file size, ancient Indian burial ground, whatever.  I only know the previous versions ran well/fine on the same hardware and data.<br /><br />As I said earlier,  I have used multiple versions of Quicken over the years and for the most part been happy.  I will likely upgrade when future versions become available."
2,"Totally disappointed.  I've used the Deluxe version for many, many years with no complaint.  However, this year I felt deceived.  Having to pay more for an upgrade was like a &#34;bait and switch&#34; scheme employed by used car salesmen.  Some should pay the price for coming out with this Deluxe screw-up."
4,This makes an unpleasant task so much more bearable! It couldn't be any easier to use! Thank you for providing such a user friendly product.
2,"Had I known there was no noticeable difference between 2013 and 2014 editions, I would not have bought the 2014 version.  Keep 2013 and save the money."
3,Continues to be easy to use and readily transfers over datas from previous years. Helps to identify best filing options for best return.
4,Thank you so much for the use of your programming it has kept my computer clean for  years with on problems
3,"I have had a few problems installing it, now resolved by your tech person.  For some reason I am unable to use One-<br />Step Update on one of my banks but I can on another bank.  Also, I now have to use a password to get into Quicken.  I never had to do this before.  These are not major things but are annoying."
0,"This program is slow and will not copy most of your dvd's due to copyright laws, I have a free program that works better, and good luck trying to get a refund cause they wont give you one...."
1,"I've been a Quicken user from the very earliest days.  I have upgraded to almost every new release when it comes out.  For the past few years, every new release has meant a host of problems that I didn't encounter in the previous release.  This time is no different.  The worst issue is the connection to my bank - I was able to download transactions with no issue with 2013 (of course, that was after nearly six months; there were problems when 2013 was first released as well).  After upgrading to 2014 I find that I have to constantly reset my online connection to my bank in order to get any transactions.<br /><br />I think I've learned my lesson, finally - Intuit releases overpriced, buggy software and expects their customers to pay that price and be beta testers for them.  Intuit used to release a quality product; over the last decade or so that has changed for the worse.  From now on I'll wait to upgrade until the software is in a stable state.<br /><br />Now that the complaining is done, I do find one thing in this version that I like - the ability to configure reminders to show in the register.  That is a feature that is useful.  That's about the only good thing that I can say about this release at this point."
4,I love it
0,Didn't work
4,"I've used MoneyDance for a long time and it has been great. Keeping track of Credit cards and payments to them is a one entry item.  Put the payment in the checking ledger and it shows up in the Credit Card account ledger. I use it to maintain several accounts. Thanks, MoneyDance!"
1,"I was originally looking for a way to transport (and work on) files across all my devices.  I was hoping the Amazon Cloud Drive would allow me to create a folder on my computer that would load and update across other devices - much like DropBox or Google Drive.  Unfortunately, the Amazon Cloud Drive is not there yet.  Right now it's totally useless as a replacement for DropBox or Google Drive.  It's really only a way to store things in the cloud..."
3,I read the best and worst reviews and downloaded anyway. The download & install is two executed files and the directions fully state that. Some who did not get the business files may have just not downloaded & installed it in two separate instances. I've been using HRB for the last 4 years and have been perfectfully happy with their product. I was able to pull over last years personal info but I am having trouble with the business info being recognized and pulled over (not sure why yet) so I need to do more research on that. Other than that so far so good. The software looks to be the same as previous years so I must say i am happy with the product and very happpy with the price.
2,"Wow was I excited when I saw this, it appeared that the mobile app was basically mint buth with my quicken data.  This prompted me to buy, I quickly learned that the mobile app is still far from what mint offers.  It does not sync any investment accounts which I find a HUGE negative, mint does this with no problem.<br /><br />Also when comparing what mint can do overall there are still missing features, thinkgs like zillow integration for tracking home value for example.<br /><br />It it were not for the reporting features of the Desktop Qucken package I would have jumped to mint completely a long time ago - when will Intuit just merge these offerings completely bringing the best of both into one product?"
2,"This is not as user friendly as I had hoped. I'm the average Joe Smo and use a computer almost everyday at work and at home. I bought this program online, and successfully downloaded it on the first try. Yea me! However, counter to it's name, this program is not intuitive nor is it quick. I managed to down load several bank accounts pretty easily. From that point on it was downhill. The help button, wasn't helpful. My attempts at sorting categories, and printing groups of similar expenses was fruitless. I ended up reverting back to my bank's online labeling program and then crunching numbers with a calculator. I am inclined to rate this thing only 2 stars, but since I bought it online and didn't get a manual, which I assume a boxed version would have, I'll add a star. I can usually figure things out well enough to make them work as needed, but for me, this program is pretty useless as is. If you are already familiar with the program, you might fair better than I. They sell a lot of these programs so obviously it works for others. I guess they paid more and also got a manual. I'll bite the bullet and buy a manual, probably one with the word Dummy in it, as that's how I feel trying to work this program. If you have not used this program before, don't buy this version."
0,"I've used Quicken for a number of years to keep track of personal finances on my local machine as I don't care to store all my financial data in one place in the cloud. Being able to download transactions from various banks and import them is a key feature for me and has been great. After upgrading from 2011 to 2014, I find that I am REQUIRED to create an Intuit ID before I am allowed to do any automatic updating from my banks. Moreover, I'm also not allowed to import files I've manually downloaded from banks without creating said ID.<br /><br />There is no reason that this needs to be a requirement to use what I would consider a core feature of the software. If you're OK with creating such an account, Quicken has otherwise treated me well over the past several years and I'm sure that this would do the same."
0,I used several browsers and rebooted my computer but I was UNABLE to download this product. I am requesting a refund!
0,"This software does not support 1120S business as of today 1/18/2013. I talked to H&R block customer support and they can only give me a \\""maybe end of Feb date\\"" when it \\""might\\"" be available. You can fill the forms out but no interview .... duh the only value added ! BEWARE on other filings as this is the only one I was focused on, however I'm guessing others might be delayed. I'm currently requesting a refund from Amazon, as that is the only option H&R block offered me."
4,"Great! Practical, A study of style conveys an idea of the range of possible elements though which one can demonstrate sophistication in elegance and fashion, covering the art of the user."
3,Turbo tax is great for people who think they can do their taxes on their own. I've tried a lot of other software programs but Turbotax is the best!
0,"Avoid this at all costs. Stay with 2011 if you can. Data conversion is very, very risky. Software is full of bugs. Couldn't really find one new feature I liked. Even uninstall was buggy."
4,"Seems popular to infect others computers with all sorts of maladies,from nuisance pop-ups and unwanted advertising, to stealing private and personal information, and complete takeovers.  avast! antivirus stops the bad guys in their tracks, handcuffs them, and turns them over to the authorities before they bring their bad news.  And, free!  Wow.  It's worth it to support these computer heroes and put an end to computer crime."
0,purchased Deluxe without knowing that Intuit completely crippled the 2014 Deluxe version. Worse greedy corporate strategy to nickel and dime loyal customer!!!! Time to switch to alternative!<br /><br />ADVICE TO INTUIT: Restore the original feature sets!!
2,"Quicken 2014 did not hurt me, whew! I say that because Quicken 2013 was a nightmare, and yet it was a relief from 2012 which completely messed up my favorite feature, the budget. I update Quicken every year as I have since the early 1990's. I've long since given up looking for new features. Now what I look for is a product that brings back the ones I used to like, makes them quicken and merges with mint as a single product. I use Quicken for all of my accounts as I do mint. Each brings something to the table. Don't waste your time on the quicken mobile version. Use mint for that. I'm afraid to even try it this year. After synching, it really messed up data in 2013.<br /><br />So, here are the new \\""features\\"" I'm observing in 2014:<br /><br />1. It installed quickly and ran right away, converting my data without complaint.<br /><br />2. One step update still works! It still has the checkbox for only showing the summary dialog if no errors, but there are always errors. Only now it shows errors but when I expand the list everything is green! In other words it things something is wrong but is keeping it from me.<br /><br />3.  The budget is still there, looks exactly the same but is a bit more sluggish. Must be lots of stuff going on behind the scenes.<br /><br />4.  All those shortcut keys that have been there for years and years no longer work! For example, hit ctl-g or ctl-f from the register and the computer goes booooinngg and nothing else happens! I think you have some focus issues to fix because the menus still show the keys available.<br /><br />5.  After one step update the register still returns you to the end, not to the current day marker, something I've hoped for for years and seems obvious as I add data way ahead of the current date. Doesn't everyone?<br /><br />6.  The budget still likes to randomly place you anywhere in the budget which is just a glorified, slower spreadsheet just like before.<br /><br />7.  Registers scroll a little more sluggishly, sweet! And, to top that off, it scrolls ahead on you so that if you lean a little too hard on the scroll keys you'll find yourself back in 2004!<br /><br />Sorry that this is such a sarcastic review, but I'm assuming that all of this was intentional. Any SQA person would have noticed these things in the first 10 minutes so they must be features, not bugs.<br /><br />By the way, I still recommend Quicken to people (and mint), but only because there is no competition, which I'm sure comes up in the release go/no-go meetings as a decision point."
3,"This software has all of the features that most &#34;amateurs&#34; need, probably a lot more.  It also provides excellent organization capabilities."
1,"Purchased the TurboTax 2012 Deluxe for Mac - download.  Waited and waited for it to download.  Finally able to open program.  First message, my downloaded seconds ago product is out of date so now it is downloading the \\""update\\"" which is also 92 meg (the same size as the original download).  Why can't my purchase download the current version of the product?"
4,Download worked great.  Installation was a breeze.  It is dependable.  Used Norton in the past so it uninstalled the old version and installed the new version in two steps with a reboot between.  No problems at all.
1,"As a long time user that was forced to upgrade from 2011 I'm very disappointed in this product.  Right off the bat there are issues with some of the new features that don't work or corrupt data.  To compound the issue I can't find anyway to contact Intuit for support, no phone number, no chat, no email.  They hide behind community forums and leave you completely on your own to find a solution.  I'd give it one star but there are a few parts that seem to work as long as you don't step on a data corrupting landmine.  Thanks for forcing me to your new version.... I would've paid to stay on 2011"
0,I paid for the state software and could never download it.  It redirected me to Turbotax site to pay for it again!  Turbo tax customer service sucks as well.  They closed my case without doing anything.  I am into it now for $96.54 and have NOTHING!  I am now on hold for over 1 hour already!!  This is my second call to them with over 1 hour wait time.
3,"Haven't used all it's features, but faster than the older version. Also allows for more options and videotaping. Clearer and user friendly."
4,A simple and easy to use program for limited needs for coordinated scheduling and calling.  Excellent product.
1,Upgraded from Quicken 2011 to get the Home and Business version.<br /><br />Quicken 2013 is slower to open and close and the upgrade didn't add any features from 2011 to 2013 I found especially useful beyond the basic business features.<br /><br />The online synchronization is much slower than my Quicken 2011.
4,I used the Free Antivirus 2014 and didn't have a problem all of last year. I recently renewed and am now using Free Antivirus 2015.
3,good system doesn't slow computer like others.<br />don't like  sneaky downloads of things I don't want ie chrome.  pop ups other than those giving status notification. always trying to sell the pay version when updating the free one.  DON'T LIKE SNEAKY TRYING TO SLIP THINGS TO ME I DON'T WANT.<br />use it because consumer reports said good things about it.
4,"I've been using Avast Free Antivirus for a number of years now, and have had no problems with infections of any kind, even when emails from some of my correspondents have been the result of their computers being infected. I'm very happy with it, and I think if a person is at least somewhat careful about opening suspicious emails or links contained in them, and where they surf on the web, it's all you need to stay safe. Five stars from me!"
3,easy to down load and easy to use
1,"I have used Outlook since it was first released. I was using Outlook 2003 when I had a problem and could not get support. I wanted to upgrade to Outlook 2010, but it was priced higher than Outlook 2013 and not available. I had to settle for Outlook 2013, which I consider a poor alternative. I had problems immediately and the remedy cost me over a hundred dollars. After complaining and not going away, $50 was refunded.<br /><br />Outlook has always been intuitive and easy to use. Outlook 2013 definitely requires re-training. It is confusing and tricked up. And to top things off it it UGLY!!!<br /><br />I would not recommend it..."
4,Turbo Tax is the best.
4,"File Center is terrific for a home user to scan files and keep them organized.  Prior attempts at going paperless failed because it was too difficult to scan, move, and rename files effectively.  With File Center, I have created all of the cabinets, drawers and folders.  When I want to scan a new document, I open the appropriate drawer and folder, click the scan button, and give the document a name.  That is all there is to it.  Very easy to use, and I like being able to access documents (and file them) from outside the program as well.<br /><br />I also download bank statement files and store them directly in the appropriate folder.  Makes all this paperless stuff much easier.<br /><br />My online backup service (Carbonite) backs up the files and I can access them via a browser or the carbonite app when I need them.  Pretty slick!"

0,"Product is great!  However, with the download I was only able to use Lightroom 5 for 3 weeks.  A complete waste of money!!!!!"
3,"The only issue is that it does not capture audio by itself on a Mac. You have to download free, open source software called Sunflower and run that application everytime you run Movavi."
2,"I have been using Quicken for quite a few years and have always thought it was an excellent product until Quicken Deluxe 2013 came out. They made a change in that version and carried it over into version 2014 that is EXTREMELY IRRITATING and that was -- They've taken the ability to view Loans in \\""Two Line Format\\"". I don't know who the Rocket Scientist was that made that decision but THEY ARE AN IDIOT. That decision should have been left up to the user. They have no idea how program user use the program so removing features to protect me from some supposed problem is acting like the Government we now have that thinks they are obligated to \\""Protect me from Myself\\"" even if I don't want them in my life."
2,"Quicken on the cloud is a lot different than on your desktop.  I couldn't even get my credit union checking account to connect with the cloud.  Good start, but I'll wait for improvements before I get excited."
3,its a very good software for free. pay the full price and get an awesome protection
4,"Avast! has worked very well with no problems over many years and several different computers.  Only once a computer caught a keylogger virus that was removed without too much damage.  Very satisfied with its performance.  Previous, more costly antivirus software was more complicated to install properly and slowed one computer so much that it was no longer usable.  That's when I changed to Avast! and have been happy every since."
4,"Turbo Tax is easy to follow and once certain info is entered, it pops up every year making filing easier each time."
0,"I've been using Quicken since the mid 90's.  I know that they have to do 'something' to justify a new release every year.  Most years that involves moving things around, changing layouts, etc.  Really, how many more features can you add to an electronic checkbook each year?  For 2013, they decided to 'improve' the savings goals and they totally destroyed one of the best hidden features of their product. Namely the ability to use savings goals like an electronic version of the envelope system.<br /><br />Let me explain:  Every payday you divide your check up into 'envelopes' for food, rent, gasoline, etc.  Then when you go to the grocery store you spend only as much money as you have in your envelope for that pay period. You used to be able to use savings goals in this manner and it worked really well.  Essentially your bank account always showed a zero balance and as soon as you had a debit come in you would offset it with a credit from the correct envelope.  It is still possible to do but in 2013 they decided to:<br /><br />1.) Make it so that you can't see all of your savings goals at once. (You have to scroll if you have more than a couple)<br />2.) Round off the dollar amounts so it only shows you whole dollar amounts. (sucks if you are trying to balance debits with credits)<br />3.) Emphasize the amount that you want to save and de-emphasize the amount you have saved by using larger fonts and a HUGE savings bar. (too much work to read)<br /><br />There is no way to control the format of your savings goals screen.<br /><br />Yes.  I know I'm using savings goals in a way Intuit may not have intended but I'm not the only one.  In searching for a way to fix the format of the savings goals, I found others on Intuit's board who were asking the same question.  How about instead of guessing how we want to see the layout, you give the customer the options to set their own layout?"
0,"I have been a long time user of Quicken.  I honestly regret the day I decided to start using Quicken.  They force you to pay for software upgrades by disabling functions in your software.  This latest update is the worst so far and is less than useless as far as I am concernd.  It disabled stuff that worked fine in the previous version and the new &#34;mobile app&#34; does not seem to function at all.  The automatic update screen says that everything is fine but no new transactions are loaded.  I found that I had to disconnect each and every account and reconnect to get the transactions to load.  Then they seem to disconnect again for no apparent reason.  I guess this instability is one of the “new features” they added.<br />Regarding the “mobile app” I made repeated attempts to configure the connections and it still refuses to connect to some accounts.  It says my user name and password are wrong but I have verified that they are correct by logging into the bank website with no problem.  Interestingly, all of my accounts connect and update properly using the free MINT app without a problem so it is not my account information or the financial institution website that is the problem.<br />Quicken support has been useless.  They just blame the problems on the financial institutions or tell me I need to reenter my information again.<br />Unfortunately, with over 8 years of data in Quicken format I feel I have little choice but to try to deal with these issues.  If you are a new user considering this type of software I would look at the free GNUCASH application."
0,"If you are expecting to get access to Quicken on your mobile device, be aware that the feature DOES NOT WORK, and Intuit has not found a solution yet!<br /><br />Also the \\""Quicken Mobile\\"" App looks EXACTLY like the free Mint App, and does not show any transactions that you entered in Quicken, but have not cleared the bank or other institution.<br /><br />A huge waste of money- keep your old version of the software."
2,"The basic edition of Tax Cut (now that HRBlock has it - \\""2011 Home Edition Basic\\"") has long been my favorite.  Originally $5 or so on sale during the Tax Cut days it was a great value.  Now, the price is going up every year to even $29.99 in brick and mortar stores - assuming you can find it - it's not such a bargain.  In my opinion, the Price/Value ratio has definitely declined under HRBlock.<br /><br />This year the Basic edition was very hard to find outside of on-line at AMAZON.  HRBlock sent me a Home Edition dvd disc, but the Basic version was not one of the choices on the disc.  Several local stores handle HRBlock tax products, but do not stock the Basic version.  The few that do carry it want way too much money for it.<br /><br />All that said, as a low-income taxpayer, the Basic Edition did what we needed it to do for our simple tax situation.  We could have used the governments' Free Tax File services instead, but we prefer the added confidentiality and flexibility of preparing our taxes with user owned software.  Prior to preparing our taxes with HRBlock Home Basic edition I prepared them by hand with a pencil  and paper tax forms from the post office - the old fashioned way.<br /><br />The tax refund I came up with by hand was then checked against what the Basic Edition calculated.  The net refund was within a few dollars each way. Perhaps filing electronically with the HRBlock program will get us our refund a little bit faster and may lessen the chances of an audit.<br /><br />My recommendation: If you are a low income taxpayer with a simple situation, this program is likely to be the best one for you in terms of Price/Value from among all those in the HRBlock tax product line.<br /><br />Amazon is the place to buy it.  It wasn't as easy to find it here as in past years, but definitely easier to find it here than traveling from store to store all over town looking for a local retailer that carries it.<br /><br />The three star rating given knocked the product one star due to what is, in my mind, apparently an intentional marketing plan that may be designed to force customers into more expensive products that we really don't need.  The product was docked a second star due to the continuing decline in the Price/Value of the product compared to past years.  That and the failure of HRBlock to include the Basic edition as a choice in the mass mailed promotional CD/DVDs.<br /><br />As far as Amazon goes, they get a Five Star rating for pricing the product more reasonably that the other editions and for the great personal service I received from the Amazon sales person contacted by telephone to help with questions encountered when buying the product in its downloadable format. That worked perfectly.<br /><br />The Amazon salesman was extremely helpful, informative, patient, courteous, and willing to walk me through the process.  He even stayed online to be sure the purchase downloaded correctly.  I'll use that feature again for other purchases."
2,"I've used H&R Block - or what used to be TaxCut - for many years now. It used to have a lot of whistles and bells (videos, side commentary) added by Kiplinger's. Now it's stripped down and offers virtually nothing beyond the minimalist interview.  I miss the personal finance perspective it once had.  Penny wise and pound foolish to gut all that, H&R. Maybe you could team up with Money magazine or something to add it in again. Still, a cheap and easy way to file taxes without having to do all the computations oneself. Worth the money."
2,"...what can I say.  I definitely do like the TurboTax products, but I guess my enthusiasm is lacking because of what it's used for!"
0,"Although it seems rather nice, there is no user support.  I imported my quicken data as a qif file just fine for a test run. But now I want to replace it with more up-to-date quicken data from my original source. I export from quikcen as a qif, open a new ibank document (with or without the old one open) but when I try to save that document within ibank, it tells me it can't save it because I have no permission. Crash. I checked the permissions and they are set correctly. I can save to the same location with any other sw. I submitted this problem to iBank a week ago to get some help and never heard back from them. Inadequate though it may be, I bought the Mac version of Quicken."
4,"I started the download at around noon and less than 2 hours later, I'm done with both my Federal and State returns.  I experienced no download problems at all.  The directions are easy to follow, and it was quick and easy.  I was very skeptical at first when I read how many other customers were having trouble with the download, but I'm really glad I tried it."
3,I usually download the newest version of Quicken and this year wasn't any different.  Much to my surprise they have added a mobile version to go along with the PC based version.  This new version also has a cloud backup at no additional cost.  Other than that it is the same reliable and easy to use tool to manage finances.  I highly recommend it.
0,"This is a one-feature review and a bit of a rant, but maybe bad reviews will push action. We'll see.<br />It really is true--still no multi-currency feature after five years (I got it on Windows in 2009). And I couldn't find on their website whether or not this feature was finally included, I had to call and ask, which was also annoying.<br />I'm glad others like it, but without multi-currency, QuickBooks for MAC is worthless to me."
1,I'm a long-time TurboTax user. Made the switch this year simply to save money as H&R Block was much cheaper. H&R Block is not as user-friendly as TurboTax. Ended up purchasing TurboTax as well and finishing my returns through them instead of H&R Block.
2,More Difficult to install than 2014
1,"I am a CPA so I compare the various tax software offerings for ease of use. I had never used H&R Block so I thought I would give it a try. I started by importing a prior year return done in Turbo tax. I completed the information on a simple return but it did not give the $400 work credit. I had done the same return in Turbo tax and it gave the credit. The Block software did not tell me why it did not give the credit. After fumbling around, I finally figured out it did not import the social security number. That should have generated a warning message from the start. My rule of thumb for software is if it cannot do the simple stuff, it certainly won't do the complex stuff."
1,"It's hard to believe that a software program that has existed in one form or another for well over a decade comes with ZERO &#34;ease of use instructions&#34; written in paragraph form, sentence by sentence written for the first-time user!!! Come on, INTUIT, is it that much of a problem to assign someone with writing skills to do such things when the program first launches as to:<br />1. Thank the purchaser<br />2. Put the purchaser at ease.<br />3. Explain how the software works, (including what it's for, what it's not for) (offer clickable topics that are segmented for facilitation)<br />4. Explain how (and when) to upgrade the software not merely throughout the year, but how to integrate it into a replacement a year later if necessary.<br />5. Offer an audio/visual tutorial to get the instructions across!<br /><br />Now, if (and/or whenever) I get an understanding of this software, I might change my rating evaluation accordingly.) Knowledge is power.<br />Don't leave me wondering, guessing, worrying."
0,I had a trust  and the trust had a partnership.  The turbo tax did not give me the options I needed to use.  Also I have an annuity and turbo tax kept asking me on and on and on a dozen times did I have the correct numbers down.  I am going to have to take my taxes to a CPA.  The turbo tax did not have what I needed.  The K-1 it generated did not fulfill my special needs.
3,"I tried every free pdf program on Google and they were miserable.....rather, they made ME miserable. Then I discovered I had enough on a gift card from my kids to try PDF Fusion. So I bought the program.I'm still learning how to fully use it, but what a great experience compared to what I'd been trying. So far, I've internally formatted two books for publication AND their covers with PDF Fusion. I'm SO happy.<br />Geni White<br />Figleaf, a Mystery, available of amazon.com"
1,"I found the 1099 instructions to be difficult to understand. I've always used TurboTax. It is much easier to use, but I switched because of their problems this year.  After buying the H&R Block software and trying to use it, I gave up and filed with TaxAct."
2,no export as dfx
1,"Pro -- Cheaper than Adobe<br /><br />Cons --<br />1.  Very hard to use - lining up text when modifying a document is an exercise in frustration.<br />2.  Graphics print poorly  I have yet to get a good graphic out of it.<br />3.  Won't print duplex - tried from thee PC's on three different printers - Brother, Canon, & HP -- No Joy"
1,"My primary need was to resurrect a program to record personal financial records of income and outgo ..<br />that I had used on Intuit QUICKEN - for mac 2007.  The Geeks at Best buy were not able to do this....<br /><br />The computer now functions with good speed ... but I haven't been able to do what I needed...<br />&#34;recording personal financial transactions&#34;  ,, Thanks for the consern ..."
2,"I've been an Intuit user for many years, since getting my Mac the product options have sucked. The 2015 Quicken version is finally becoming more like the PC version but not all the way. Using this is better than a manual excel spreadsheet but there is still room for improvement. The oddest thing is you can't update a single account online without going to the accounts tab at the top of the page. Again not a bad option, I'm looking forward to using the mobile feature and checking out the other new features."
4,"I love my Garmin and never had any issues with map updates. If you read the directions and do exactly as they tell you to do, it works fine"
2,I really didn't read that this was for one year only. . . I should have bought the Office so I wasn't forced to update every year. I'd never actually buy this again.
3,"This product was easy to use, can be used on multiple computers in our home<br />and an inexpensive way to keep our kids monitored and computers safe"
2,"While I haven't used the programs heavily yet, most of the products seem to be fine but I paid extra to get Outlook and it doesn't work the same as Outlook on the PC.  On the PC, I was able to sync my calendar with iCloud but it can't be done on the Mac version.  Also, the read receipt feature doesn't seem to be in the Mac version of Outlook. However, Outlook does process iCloud mail (IMAP) much better than the PC version did."
4,There is no question that no other office suite compares to Microsoft Office.  Even though it is on a mac there is no question that nothing compares to this product for productivity.
1,Many of the features do not work.  Support is not very good.  I have been trying for almost a month to get one feature working through the support.  They keep telling me to do what they told me several times before and still doesn't work.  Documentation is sparse so you can't resolve issues on your own.
3,"i have been using this product for years and have never had a problem..the only thing i can say about it is that it slows up your computer start up a bit because it gets new definitions everytime you turn the computer on,."
1,"This might be a good program to stop viruses, but it caused my computer to sow down and wouldn't let it stream from Amazon Prime.  Also messed up my email, so I had to stop the active antivirus for both the email and web browsing which seemed to defeat the purpose.  I will now install the fee based Norton Antivirus."
0,You are wasting your time if you jump through all the hoops to buy this tax program only to be told it is not available to purchasers outside the US and that you can't efile from overseas.  Find another way to buy it.
2,The darn thing will not copy DRM protected files that were copied from an old computer. Those are trash now I guess. Does lots of other things though.
2,"It is an accounting program, it should do certain things well.  Everything else is fluff.  This has a lot of fluff but lags in the important stuff. Downloading account information, seems to forget accounts sometimes, then remembers them.  Sometimes is just doesn't update...very frustrating."
1,Too many steps just to download this software.
2,I'm dissappointed that Turbo Tax charges a $34.99 fee to e-file state returns after purchasing the tax package. I file my state returns in the mail and will do so as long as Turbo Tax charges these rediculous fees
3,"A few little quirks...and the ubiquitous prompt to file the State return that is not and has never been required, but overall good experience again. 5th or 6th year of using it.<br /><br />Note: I ONLY use the install (.exe) version. I strongly dislike the TurboTax Online version of the same product. I like to save my file on my local computer and have complete control without the cludgy web interface"
0,"I bought this software because my old Mavis Beacon does not work with my new 64 bit laptop.  As I compare the 2 software, Mavis Beacon is easier to understand, use, it's more interactive and fun to use due to its games and clearly concise lessons.  I just purchased a new version of Mavis, so bye bye Typing not so Quick and not so Easy"
3,It's tax software......
1,I have been using TT Deluxe because they had more forms than Tax Cut. This year I required schedule D so paid for upgrade to Premier. Now find they are providing free upgrade to Premier. They are silent about  users who paid for the update. Next year will be different.
4,I downloaded the software but in the process of getting ready to install it I found I did not have to. My installation was already the latest version and all I needed was to copy and paste the new key to 'Account' 'Renew MY Subscription'. I lost a few days because the new key starts counting its days from the current date rather than the expiration date of the key you are upgrading but for the price and simplicity of the whole thing I was not about to quibble over a few days. Whole thing worked great.
4,"First time I've done this. I used to buy Turbo Tax at local retail stores but this year I thought I'd check if it was available online from amazon.com.  Sure enough, it was!  Download went smoothly and quickly. So I saved a special trip to the store!"
3,Very well pleased for a free service.
0,"had to move to an exchange server, no control, not worth the time it takes to setup. chincy feeling interfaces."
0,"As a CPA and someone who enjoys managing their money I was looking forward to moving my preferred method of tracking my accounts from excel to Quicken.  I could not be more disappointed.  As a former user of Mint.com I had hoped to have the same functionality, plus better investment tracking.  You would think that with Quicken owning Mint having at least equivalent functionality would seem logical, but apparently not.  I had hoped to be able to update all of my accounts by pressing a button within Quicken, but many online banks such as ING and Ally do not support this functionality.  As a result, I still have to go to these sites to download each account individually.  I have tried 4 separate times to import my 401 along with my wife's.  We have a 401k from the same employer and even though I mark the acount as my spouse's during setup, it always imports into my account.  These are just two examples.  Additionally, any help you try to receive is via e-mail with no possibility of getting someone on the phone.  I could keep going on but I think my message is already clear.  I urge any reader of this not to purchase Quicken.  Please do not waste your money.  If I were an employee of the company I would be totally ashamed of this abomination."
2,"The best thing about this product is that when it captures a video from the Internet it actually downloads the file rather than capturing the screen.  This avoids having to edit out pauses caused by inadequate throughput or having a popup appear in the capture box.  However, a majority of my attempts return a message that says it is unable to download the video.  I expect that if you are capturing a video that you or a friend has made, it will work very well.  This might help explain the 5-star reviews.  Also, my DSL is not very fast, and, I expect, gets low priority in the server queue.  It is possible that someone who has an optical or cable line may not have this problem: I don't really think so because on some sites it just never seems to work no matter how rarely viewed the video is.  Sometimes, if I am willing to repeatedly tell it to download the file and wait each time while it tries, it will eventually manage to download the file. I think that some web sites simply do not allow videos to be downloaded by a copier.  Then a screen capture is better.<br /><br />I should note that once it successfully begins the download, it will finish it successfully.  When it does, it does an excellent job.  The quality of the downloaded video seems to be limited only by the quality of the video itself.  And, when it works, I am not required to devote my time to watching it.  I can start watching another video while the download process continues, and I can even download the second one simultaneously with the first: if it is able to download the second.  Also, the download has the same title as the original video, not some meaningless ID stuck on by the software.<br /><br />The conversion process seems to be good most of the time."
3,"The price is right. You get what you pay for. The frequent upgrade to pay version requests are annoying, but it does work and you can choose to renew the free version indefinitely... so far."
3,Like my headline said. Quicken Deluxe 2013 met my Quicken expectations. It shows me my ever depressing bank account is.
0,There are several hangups with 2014 linking accounts for auto update seems to be weak.  Unable to expand Quicken to full screen on a 21inch monitor.  Inability to get human help to resolve these problems has me looking after 20 years of using Quicken at other products.[[ASIN:B00E7X9UKC Quicken Rental Property Manager 2014 [Download]]]
0,Cannot download it because MS link to verify my account says &#34;Not Found&#34;<br />There does not appear to be any other options or to communicate with anyone to correct the problem.
2,Fair but object to the weekly cleaning of the cookies that keep me signed in varios programs that forces re sign ups.
0,"This is a real pain.  You have to wait for Amazon to email you a form to verify you are a teacher or student, then return to Adobe to wait for your Activation code.  I am still waiting."
3,Avast has worked fine for me for several years now. I do not use the computer very often and Avast seems to do a good job of keeping viruses from overtaking me.
2,"The product is not bad, it is just not what I was looking for.  I wanted something I could share with my kids (to have some games) and  more advance for myself with more popular songs.  It is very easy to connect to the piano, that is very useful.  Just keep in mind that there is no upgrade for songs,  it is a close package, no upgrade for more songs or more updated songs as far as I know."
2,"It does what it needs to be done, I have not had very many problems with it hope to upgrade to 360 next year."
1,Too many format changes from 2010 version. Unnecessary learning curve. Keeping 2010 Version. To accomplish same outcome I had to go through several more format screen than before.
2,I've used Quicken for years on my windows laptop for my work but have been using iBank on my Mac.  When iBank stopped functioning properly I decided to try Quicken.  Seems to work fine accept there is no auto save and it does not save to the Quicken folder.  I always have to move it there manually so you have to remember to save it.  Budget function is so-so but adequate.  Could give 4 or 5 stars if not for that.
4,Great
0,Bought this because I'm a self-employed contractor filing with 1099-misc. It's terrible! I had to use the 'search and find' function to find multiple forms for my taxes. If I could ask for my money back I would.
4,"As always, helpful tax info"
2,I don't know what this is.  I thought it was renewing what I had already but it didn't replace it.  As a matter of fact I do not know what this is doing for my computers. I installed it but who knows.  Maybe it is just because I don't understand.
4,"I was afraid that I would not like it or be able to use, but I am really happy with it, works perfectly."
0,"Have used McAfee for 6-7 years. Installed Total Protection 2015 on 4/1/15 & removed Total protection 2014, which I never have had a problem with. TP 2015 has been a problem every day since. I use Internet Explorer browser & Google as search home page/search engine. Now Google won't load with Firewall on. Have opened 2 tech assistance complaints with McAfee and now they want me to go to a higher level and pay for the resolution. I fired McAfee and will pay for another anti-virus software to replace this one if I have to."
1,"I'm a long-time QuickBooks customer, and I really resent being forced to upgrade every other year when Intuit \\""removes\\"" online support (i.e. you can no longer download bank & credit card transactions unless you buy the new version). That's a terrible way to treat your customers.<br /><br />What's worse is that when I purchased the new QuickBooks Pro 2014 (no inexpensive upgrade- you have to buy it all over again), the license key and product key don't work. The customer support hours are limited to 8 am-8 pm PST, despite the fact that all the people answering the phone are in India. I called 7 different times, all to no avail. Each time, a person I can barely understand asks me to hold while they consult a \\""subject matter expert.\\"" After that they never come back. The first time, I waited 37 minutes on hold before I gave up. The second time I tried their tech support, and the rep who answered wanted me to give him remote control of my computer. Sorry, not happening. I refused, and then he admitted that only customer support could give me a new license key anyway. After multiple calls, I finally got a customer service rep who decided I \\""must have downloaded the wrong version.\\"" I explained that was impossible- I downloaded the exact version I purchased from Amazon- I could not have physically purchased one version and downloaded a different version. She transferred me, more time on hold, only to have another person ask for remote access to my computer. When I refused, he hung up on me.<br /><br />The whole customer experience was a nightmare. Needless to say, Intuit has strayed far, far away from the customer service that made them legendary in the early days. Now they're as exasperating as deal with your cable company!"
4,"I used TurboTax for double digit years.  I tried TaxCut once many years ago and it was in no way the match of TT.  However, TT 2013 was unlike previous years:  Difficult to move back and forth; difficult to access forms.  Overall, a disappointing experience and I did not feel as confident about my return as I had in previous years.  It wasn't hard to try H&R Block after reading the TT 2014 reviews.  I am so glad I did!<br /><br />I used Deluxe because it was cheaper than Basic + State.  My only 'tricky bit' is Schedule C.  Not sure how Basic handles this, but it was easy with Deluxe and I felt confident (v. important) when it was finished.<br /><br />I liked the wrap up, but the alerts could be more informative.  E-filing was easy (get your pin from the IRS website) and the option to print to PDF was good, though I'm not sure why it needs its own app.  I opted to e-file fed and mail state and that was actually given as an option, rather than a buried selection meant to drive state e-file sales.  Much appreciated.<br /><br />Will stay with H&RB provided they don't follow Intuit's path."
0,I upgraded because i wanted the mobile version for my phone but it didnt sync correctly the balances it shows on the destok app and on the phone app....

2,"Program works good sometimes....other times it crashes for no apparent reason.  When I end the program and restart it, it usually works the first time."
4,Good learning tool. If anyone has a problem understanding how Access works they need to by the Professor Teaches Access.
1,"Downloaded and registered and it worked the first time.  Each other time, it wanted me to reregister and then would say I was already registered and still wouldn't allow me to use it.  Contacted Amazon and then they said I had to contact WinZip.  Got 17.5 out of it, but it was a pain!"
4,"My third year doing my owner personal and business tax returns after the CPA got over $1,200.  It is made so easy to follow and I regret I didn't use TurboTax long ago!"
4,"This was a big waste of money..Word and excel neither will open. It keeps saying \\""microsoft excel has stopped working\\""  or \\""microsoft word has stopped working\\"" I have windows 8 brand new computer. This is not even cool!! So upset!!<br /><br />UPDATE!! Called microsoft and they were wonderful!! Fixed my issues and now problem solved and item works great!! Thanks microsoft"
4,works great
3,"Great product, great price as opposed to what else is out there. Will handle a number of w2's and 1099's, which works for me. Being paid by different companies. Updates are automatic. Works well for my business..."
2,"Converting data from 2014 to 2015 was a bit tricky in some cases.  Quicken 2015 combined disrelated Quicken files.  It took data from one Quicken file and added to another completely different Quicken file.  I had to go and delete the transactions.  One other point, it loads slower than Quicken 2014 - not by a lot but it is noticeable."
4,I have used Norton internet security for a couple years now and am very satisfied.  Had a virus last year and used other programs and could not get rid of it.  One scan with this software and all my issues were resolved.  This is very expensive when you buy it in the store.  I found it at Target for 70ish bucks and got it on here direct download for only $25.  A good purchase with a great price.
4,Easy to use very user freindly
2,"Loads much slower than older version.  Some of the changes were totally unnecessary and do not constitute improvements, just changes for the sake of change.  New problems downloading from a bank site that was not a problem before.  It's still an essential program however after years and years of use of prior versions."
3,I have used the H and R Block At Home Deluxe + State software for years. No complaints from me.
1,"Main program is good, bearing in mind the arcane nature of the tax preparation process. I was shocked, however, to discover adding a second State was an extra $39 fee by itself - whereas the whole deluxe Federal tax program, including the first State, is less than $30! This is clearly exploitation  and the reason I am rating it only as 2 stars."
1,"For an old timer, the new widely expanded variations and possibilities (formats, styles, etc.) just complicate my attempts to use Word and Excel as I have for 20 years.  Worst aspect for me...suddenly (I still don't know why ) my spread sheet containing carefully garnered details on more than 500 DVDs was just gone.  Nowhere on my computer."
0,"I purchased the product key through Amazon after numerous failed attempts through the Office website.  Office.com wouldn't let me continue past the \\""your email address is already verified\\"" message.  Unfortunately, the product isn't a direct download through Amazon, and I was directed back to the Office website with the same issue once more.<br /><br />I contacted Office.com customer service, who in more polite terms suggested that I'm an idiot who keeps signing in with the wrong account.  Yet, they aren't able to view which account I'm signed in with, or tell me what the correct account might be.  They eventually gave up and told me to call them during business hours Monday - Friday.<br /><br />Until Microsoft improves their academic verification system and/or fixes their website, save yourself a headache and find another way to purchase the product."

4,"avast! Antivirus has saved me many a time from viruses, both while browsing the Internet and also in incoming email.  It keeps itself up-to-date automatically, and doesn't pester me to Upgrade (at least not frequently, anyway) to their premium version, which costs money.  Best of all, just like any anti-virus software it has to always be running, but avast! doesn't hog your machine or slow it down like some other competing products I've used.<br />It's clean, constantly maintained/updated, has never failed, does one thing really well instead of trying to be a 'do everything' utility, and is non-intrusive / plays well with other software -- i.e., lets you do real, productive work while it runs in the background. And it's FREE. There's no catch -- I've used it for 3-4 years now.  (You do have to annually renew your license, but it remains free.)<br />I use a ton of software -- this is a keeper.  I give it 5 stars.  I even use avast! on my Android cell phone, but that's another story."
0,This was a waste of money. I downloaded it on my laptop which has Windows 8 and my laptop said it wasn't compatible.  I had to delete it.
0,"Okay, this has got to be the most stupid process I have ever experienced (aside from my wedding to ding-dong).  Well, after going through this for 35 minutes (and I am uber tech savvy, so take this to heart), I came to realize a very important thing.      \\""Our GPSs are probably loaded with good maps!!!\\""    Yes, that's right.  Unless you live and drive somewhere in the bush, our maps are probably fine.  Why update?  Because we can?  Because it's cheap?  $70 down to $39?  Well, after 35 minutes of \\""We are experiencing technical difficulties processing your code\\"" I am going to scream, yell, kick, complain, etc. to Amazon.  They need to tell Garmin to take a hike...because the codes are not processing with Garmin's website.  Ugh...this is straight up stupid!!    Okay, folks...here's the REAL kicker.  Why pay $30 for map updates?  Cmon, brand new Garmins are available for $100 or less now, for the base units.  And to boot, our new, cool phones (if you don't have one yet, get one!) have built in GPS.  GoogleMaps is free to download, and it comes with FREE MAPS!!      So, ...    (1)  Total Pain in the Neck to Deal With (if it even works);  (2)  Cost-benefit is Questionable;   (3)  Free GPS via GoogleMaps;  (4)  Update Cost is Approaching Cost of New Units.    Based on these factors, I suggest grabbing an iced tea & chuckling as you download googlemaps for free.  ;)"
4,The validation process was very quick with my .edu email. Adobe sent the key instantly to my email. Everything else was just as advertised. (I'm in the US)
3,"I did not purchase PC Matic from Amazon; I am an Amazon shopper and I wanted to pass on to other shoppers the value of PC Matic.  I have an ASUS notebook N56E, 3 years old.  I recently started having some real issues with it.  It got to the point where I ordered a new ASUS Notebook (my 3rd).  In the interim, I had seen the commercials on PC Matic and then one evening I gave in to the commercial and purchased PC Matic.  I have been using Norton's 360 Premier Edition, along with ARO 2013 and I felt these were doing what I needed them to do for my maintenance and security needs.  After once running PC Matic it found Malware which had eluded Norton's 360.  PC Matic identified and removed 11 different malwares found on my notebook.  It also reconfigured some things, cleaned up my Registry and did an outstanding job overall.  My computer processor had dropped from i5 level down to i3 and below... it was like I had been tossed back 20 years to the old 14.4 dialups.  I have now had PC Matic for about 2 weeks, my ASUS N56E is basically back to i5 processor level with lighting speed opening and closing, better then when it was new.  As for the other notebook which I purchased... well I received it and I am attempting to learn Windows 8.1 and I am finding myself back on my old ASUS with Windows 7... yea it will take me a bit to adjust to 8.1 but until I do, Thank You PC Matic I can still us my older ASUS thanks to your software."
1,User friendly but once the tax forms are complete TurboTax charges 40+ dollars to submit. WE SHOULD BE TOLD OF THESE HIDDEN CHARGES BEFORE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT! !!
2,I was disappointed that it is not certified (and there appears no plans to resolve this) to run on Surface Pro 2 which is my primary machine.
2,Overpriced.  They should include the basic payroll in the price of the already expensive software.
3,"I've used Avast (Free) for two years and have not had cause to regret it. The product does exactly what it advertises and does it unobtrusively. It does not hog memory or slow down my computer (an HP with 4 GB memory, Windows 7). My only negative comment is that its add-on for Outlook doesn't seem to play well with the program. Some emails cause Outlook to crash and the only thing that Microsoft has been able to tell me is that the add-on is the likely source of trouble. Of course, that could just be Microsoft trying to cover itself and your mileage may vary."
3,"I've been using TaxCut since at least 1994 to do fairly complex returns including Schedule C, Schedule D and Schedule E. Although the program isn't perfect -- especially the state versions (CA, NY, PA) which leave too much in my hands for my taste -- I've learned its quirks over the years and the opportunity cost of switching to (say) TurboTax seems too high to me.<br /><br />I bought a cheap copy of TurboTax for 2010 after the 2010 tax season and re-entered about half of my 2010 tax data into that program to see if it seemed to be better than TaxCut, especially since I now use Quicken for my accounting program and Intuit makes both Quicken and TurboTax. I was disappointed that TurboTax was no easier to use than TaxCut and, because I was having to learn it, I couldn't move as quickly through the program. My impression by the time I stopped my experiment is that TurboTax didn't have any improvements that seemed worthy of making a change and its unfamiliar interface had its own learning curve.<br /><br />So, for me, TaxCut continues to be my tax preparation program of choice. Now that I'm in PA, the state version of the program also works better for me, largely because the PA form is pretty simple. After I've done another return or two, I may even stop buying the PA state version since it is $20 and doesn't do much for that price simply because the PA return is so simple.<br /><br />One last thing: eFiling<br /><br />Since my version of the program provided free Federal efiling, and since the IRS will now accept efiling of complex returns like mine -- as recently as 2010 they did not -- I efiled this year. The only problem I had was that I couldn't successfully \\""sign\\"" the submission by entering 2010's AGI figure. After calling the IRS to find out what the problem was (as I was told to do by TaxCut when I couldn't successfully efile), apparently if one is efiling for the first time, the correct answer to the AGI question for the previous year is $0. Once I made that change, the efile happened smoothly. Presumably, efiling 2012 will require using the 2011 AGI figure.<br /><br />Since I had efiled the Federal return, I decided to try efiling the PA return. That cost me another $20 and didn't really achieve my goal of not having to go to the Post Office to mail the return since after efiling I was informed by the program that I needed to mail some supporting documentation (i.e. copies of 1099s) to PA anyway. So, going forward, I'll just print the PA return and will mail all of the stuff together for a savings of $14 or so (since I mail stuff to the tax man using certified mail w/return receipt, it costs about $6 in postage)."
3,GOOD
1,"Well the option for a mobile app sucked me in. I upgraded from the 2012 edition to the 2014 rental property manager. Each edition makes it harder to use. What's up with that?! I haven't even got as far as using the mobile app. Just using it on my computer and the thing has crashed in one day four times, apologizing as it close down that all of the data that I recently entered might be lost. The fact that the warning comes means Quicken must know about this bug and has done nothing about it. grrrrrr. Back to load Quicken AGAIN. Perhaps Quicken will offer a free upgrade to fix this mess. Isn't going to help me tonight. Sigh. Yes, I see there is a nice Quicken lady offering to help. I don't have time for that. I need it to work from the start. Two stars because all the other software around that does this stinks also."
2,"I bought this out of desperation.  I have had Print Shop for years.  Version 23 won't work on Windows 8.  This is adequate.  It is hard to use but it gets the job done. I was going to try Microsoft Publisher but it was too expensive.<br /><br />I like to print banners.  I wish they would quit changing how things work.  If you stick with the four page banner they offer, you can make it work.  The graphics aren't as nice as they used to be.  They seem dumbed down.  The print quality is much lower than version 23.<br /><br />Sigh..."
2,"I bought this for the anti-virus. Kaspersky has been at or near the top of antivirus rankings for years. In this, I was not disappointed. My first scan turned up a few things left behind by my old antivirus (Avast), it runs quickly, and the real-time scanning is unobtrusive.<br /><br />I'm not fond of some of the extras that come along with it though. They really could have done a much better job.<br /><br />The &#34;Safe Money&#34; app seemed interesting, but it does not integrate with very many browsers. I use Opera, which has nothing at all from Kaspersky available. Chrome recently disabled all extensions not found on Google's app store, and Kaspersky has not fixed that, so Chrome is a no-go. I don't use Firefox or IE but I did notice IE had something going on with Kaspersky. There were some other extensions that came along as well, but as I said I use Opera so I'm not really sure what they would give me.<br /><br />The parental protection stuff is a joke. Web filtering works; but adding exceptions does NOT work. I had to disable web filtering entirely to allow Netflix. Very disappointing. Access restriction controls, which supposedly allow locking specific users out of the computer during certain times (a.k.a. &#34;bedtime enforcer&#34;) dutifully return to the login screen if the computer is on during that time. But the user can log back in and dismiss the Kaspersky dialog. Completely worthless.<br /><br />The various scans have very flexible scheduling, which I like. But I don't see an option to pause the scan if the computer is in use. There was once I came back from vacation and immediately the scan started (because the computer had been off, it missed the scheduled scan), making me unable to use the computer until I figured out what was going on, then explored the menus until I found the &#34;pause scan&#34; button. There was no nice right-click menu on the task bar to pause the scan or see if it was running like I've seen in other AV products. Once I had the scan paused (at 94%) I accidentally hit the &#34;start scan&#34; button that looks like a &#34;play&#34; button on a music player. That restarted the scan from 0% instead of resuming the paused scan. You do that with some link-looking text. Not very clear UI at all.<br /><br />All in all, I'm mostly satisfied...but I may shop around looking at reviews of other products when the time is up, looking for more functional extras or better UI."
1,"Kinda boring, limited and not real exciting.  I would prefer to buy something more interesting for my child - more adventures..."
2,"I heard was &#34;jsut like office&#34; and although it has the same basic structure and function... that is not true.<br />It is a great free program, but saying it is the same is not a true statement.<br />The first spreadsheet I opened it was unable to format the special text at an angle in the header columns.<br />But... for simple spreadsheets and word processing...... 90% of the spreadsheets... probably be just fine"
2,"I used Microsoft Money for many years but since they have discontinued it I felt I needed to move on while there is still a product that can convert the files. This Quicken Starter did so without any problem. Except... This basic version will not keep track of my mortgage or presumably other loans. So now, if I want to keep track of my mortgage I will have to upgrade and manually input to get currant; and pay. Had I realized this I would have gotten the next higher version. Other then a mortgage my needs are simple. A mortgage or car loan are pretty \\""basic/starter\\"". Using Quicken is not particularly difficult, although I do not feel it is as intuitive as Microsoft's check ledger design. The help menu is worthless. At least they are still making and hopefully improving the product. They should state more clearly what each edition does, but I suppose it is in there best interest to have you upgrade. The product does work and I am getting used to it. I hope this helps."
4,It did the job.
0,I have tried multiple times to download and install with no success. Very frustrating.
2,Works nicely but better instructions for a novice. I know I am not using it to its full capacity. So far has worked great for creating and editing Word docs with the capacity to email
0,"6/29/2015 - I just installed Total Protection a few days ago on a Windows 7 operating PC (x64Bit).  Since then my machine gets a blue screen and then shuts down every few minutes after start up.  I spent 4 hours with McAfee tech support and they took it off the machine and re-installed it.  This did not fix the issue.  I had to call back.  After another hour on the phone, the tech confirms that McAfee is causing the problem but a Level 2 tech can't help me today and maybe 4 days from now will call me to fix this. The level 2 tech never calls. If I look online, this is a very old problem posted with McAfee over several years.  his has been a nightmare and immense time waster. A serious virus had us remove McAfee from our company years ago. I had personally stopped using it back in 2009 and now I'm an idiot to think they have fixed anything correctly in 2015.  Use Kaspersky instead. I have never had a problem with them."
2,"I am a complete beginner when it comes to Dutch. I wanted to teach myself at home and wanted something flexible with regards to my time. I chose to give this one a try mainly because of the cheaper price compared to other products.<br /><br />Pros:<br />This program is easy to use as it works straight off of any internet browser and requires no separate downloads. All you need is a working mic, a good headset, and a mouse to get started. All commands/navigation are extremely basic and easy, even for the technologically-challenged.<br /><br />The program offers 2 native speakers for pronunciation comparisons, 10 modules per language level that can be studied in any order, repetitive audio loops for each module, fun little quiz/test games that forces you to know the material by heart the more you play, and a point system to help track your progress.<br /><br />This program is basically a survivor's guide for people needing to say some quick phrases (such as, \\""Where is the shop?) in Dutch here and there.<br /><br />Cons:<br />While a 2-year subscription is more than enough to complete this program (level 1, 2, 3, and level 3 business-Dutch), you need to plan out the lessons and the pace yourself as the program does not offer anything for this. The point system is buggy/unreliable and sometimes loses the progress you've made. The program also offers no explanation on grammar or pronunciation rules for the complete beginners. It's basically, \\""learn by mimicking.\\"" This may be fine for some, but without a proper foundation it's going to lead to a lot of headache in the future. The program is also for speaking-only. There is no written portion or \\""construct your own phrases/sentences\\"" so if you're looking for that, this program is not for you.<br /><br />This program will not enable you to hold any meaningful conversation with people in Dutch as you will gain no knowledge in grammar or sentence structuring of any sort through this program.<br /><br />If you supplement thiswith a program that focuses on grammar and all that jazz, it can be good."
1,"It's definitely a lot worse than the 2004 version I used to use.  It's terribly slow and I often have trouble selecting a field that I want to ender information into.  Even when I do add a new record, it might take 3-5 seconds to respond.  I've using the latest version of Mavericks on a 2010 iMac.  This is the slowest application running on my machine.  I've done everything that Intuit recommended to try to speed it up, but it's hopeless.  Is as though it's running in an emulation environment.  Now, of course, I'm stuck.  I can't back out of this 2015 version and I'll have to suffer with it until Intuit fixes it or I with to some other vendor.  I really used to like the old version because it was, well, Quick.  Now it's &#34;Slowen&#34;.  One feature I'd like to see is a one-click plot of payee over time.  You can get this information, but it's really a pain to do it."
4,TurboTax downloads from Amazon are the best. You get to keep a copy in your Software Library and keep it there for years in case you ever need to reinstall it down the road.
4,"Free and it does a phenomenal job.  What more can you ask for?  The paid version is sure to satisfy those that need more protection and more features.  I've been using Avast for 5-6 years, virus free!!!"
2,"I won't be buying this after the trial period. I don't think it's worth the price. I bought Sony Vegas version 11, (last years version) for under $30.00 and it does everything I need it to do."
0,"It worked fine for the first week or so then it suddenly started to freeze on launch. I've reloaded it 3 times rebooted my Mac, thrashed catalogs and there is no way to get it to launch making it useless to me. I am running system 10.8.5."
1,"I purchased Elements 13 download because my new laptop (as with many newer laptops it appears) does not come with an optical reader.  The E-13 suite duplicates, in part, what is already in Elements  8 (which I have used quite happily on my older laptop for a good while). The Guided and Expert options of any real use in E-13 seem largely spins on what is already offered in the Quick Option (which, again, is pretty much the same as Elements 8). The upgrades in E-13 appear largely to rest on the social media connectability and multi-image options such as albums, calendars, and the like); options for which I really have little use or interest. E-13 does, however, seem to boot up more quickly than E-8.  Also, there were 4 fatal errors in the download, leaving several functions unavailable (Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package, for example).  Thus far, then, I seem not to have gotten everything for which I paid. There are fixes indicated for the items which failed to download, but initial efforts to discover how to install them according to information provided in the error Report have gone unrewarded.  All-in-all, I would have to say I am a bit disappointed in E-13 and am glad I waited to purchase it until the 1\2-off Daily Deal. E-13 is a welcome addition to this laptop, but with what I have seen of E-13 thus far, I would have been happier had there been a download for Elements 8.  Peter O. Welte"
2,"I've been a long time Quicken user.  My needs are fairly average as I use it for personal finances (bank accounts, credit cards, investment accounts, and so on).  I've never really had too many problems with it and I don't take every upgrade.  It's usually 2 or 3 years between upgrades.  The upgrade to 2011 was painless and I was back up and running without issues.  I only give it 3 stars as the innovation is fairly lacking.  It's basically the same application with some UI layout differences.  If there are any major enhancements, I don't see it.  It would be nice if someone would enter the market and mix things up to cause more advancements."
4,Glad to have it.
4,"One of the best free antivirus software packages I have used. It seems to do a great job as my very old laptop is still running smoothly with out a lot of bloatware or badware gumming it up. It works, it works in the back ground so I don't have to mess with it which is something I like."
0,"EPIC FAIL!<br /><br />_ After an hour of trying, re-downloading, etc... there is no way to get this set up on my MAC. No help pages easily available. Nothing.  I am stuck with a message that says &#34;You do not have permission to update cloud drive. Please contact your system administrator to obtain permission.&#34; Horrible, frustrating. Difficult. I will pay for a better service that doesn't waste my time!"
1,"With a poor explanation, I had to expend too much money to buy the State tax version, plus the eletronic filing fees. I was not happy at all with Turbo Tax this year."
3,Worked very well for me. Transferred my 2013 Turbo Tax without a hitch. I liked the interview process more than Turbo tax. It was easy to get to forms and navigate around. I have used Turbo Tax for more then ten years and it was the last straw this year with them. I did use Turbo Tax for my partnership files this year but I plan on switching over to H&R's software next year. I docked one star because I couldn't print a worksheet and  mailers for my state's estimated tax. I am looking forward to finding an alternative to Quicken and washing my hands of the Intuit mafia.
2,I'm not overly impressed with the 2013 Microsoft Office. I find some parts of it rather confusing. I think most people would.
0,"This is no longer 'deluxe' - removal of Schedule D means it is now a basic product. I've used TurboTax for over 10 years, but I'm certainly not paying an extra $30 for the premier version this year just to use the forms I've always used with the deluxe version. Plenty of other alternatives out there."
1,"This has got to be one of the most infuriating products I have ever used. After reviewing and categorizing entire account histories with matching bank balances, out of the blue transactions will disappear. These transactions were downloaded to Quicken and the balances matched just minutes prior. It is happening with multiple accounts and no Quicken Help provides a solution. I have tried updating again and resetting the account. The only temporary solution is deleting the entire account and creating it again from scratch. Of course this doesn't solve the problem for long, it will lose transactions again."
3,"TurboTax is the gold standard. But Intuit has to watch pricing, or I will move to another product."
0,1 star
4,I have had many antivirus programs in the 30 years I've been computing and I like Avast the most of them all.
2,Version 2015 is not as good as Quicken 2014. For one thing some of my accounts will not show all of the columns in the Holdings View.
1,It is not as complete as the old one I had. to hard to understand for older people .
1,"The download worked perfectly, but two weeks after installing it, the program began to malfunction and I spent 2 hours on the phone with customer service to fix the issue. Wished I had bought the CD version so that I had the information I needed to fix the issue."
3,I would say the best accounting software out there but it all depends on what you are trying to do.  We have tried everything from VersaCheck to PeachTree to Sage but this product is the most efficient and has become the most well known.  I didn't give 5 stars because I do not like the offer where you can have them host it for a certain amount a month instead of just buying it.  Most businesses are just going to buy it such as mine.
1,"I became the trustee of a trust that makes annual payments to beneficiaries, files form 1041 and sends K-1 forms to the beneficiaries.  For tax year 2013 I purchased TT Deluxe for my personal taxes and TT Business for the trust and all went well.  For tax year 2014 I noticed the Home & Business. something I probably overlooked for tax year 2013.  One week ago I called TT (with much difficulty) and spoke with a very nice lady.  I specifically asked if TT Home & Business would do my personal taxes and my trust taxes including Forms 1041 and K-1.  She did not know and asked me to wait while she spoke with her supervisor.  A few minutes later she came back on the line and confirmed to me that TT Home & Business WOULD take care of both my personal taxes and my trust taxes including Forms 1041 and K-1.  I purchased TT Home & Business and downloaded it from a non-Amazon retailer.  Guess what?  I can only prepare my personal tax return.  NO Form 1041 or K-1.  It will only do Forms W-2 and 1099.  BEWARE of their customer support via telephone.<br /><br />So now I'm back at Amazon with one of their gift cards to purchase TT Business for my trust  like I did for tax year 2013.  I'll eat the difference in price between Deluxe and Home & Business and prepare my personal taxes on Home & Business.  Lesson learned."
4,"I upgraded to 2015 from Deluxe 2012. This purchase was made because Intuit dropped online updating/downloading financials with 2012. The reason I bring this up is because if you purchase 2015 you will probably be forced, in three years or so to purchase the  current version of Quicken. Now having said that, I have been using Quicken for about 12 to 15 years so I obviously like the software. I think it works good its reliable and relatively easy to set up and use.  I would recommend with the caveat that you will have to upgrade to the new version when Intuit wants you to."
2,Not much new...again...<br /><br />Intuit is just sucking money from the installed base again.  How about some significant improvements to investments ?
3,"The only thing I miss is the simple way to &#34;Find&#34;. The word was there, nice and visible and clickable! Didn't have to go to the top of the page and get a drop down menu.<br />PL"
4,"Easy to use, and pretty accurate. Be sure to check everything over before you print it all out.  I buy this year after year because I have tried others but this is the best on the market. Also be sure to buy the right version for you, personal versus this one, Deluxe, for itemized deductions from a home business, for example. This gives you one state, so if you are working in more than one state you would need more forms.  One other warning-do not leave things til the last minute, because when you download or put the disc into your computer, it will start to update everything to the most recent versions, and this can take hours depending on the speed of your connections and the detail of the changes."
3,"The only thing that is difficult about Quicken is entering investment accounts manually, but there is a work-around.  I have used this for years and wouldn't be without it."
1,"Quicken warned me that if I did not upgrade to Quicken 2013, that they would disable my online downloads. So when I upgraded, Quicken 2013 ran *extremely* slow. It would freeze for 10 - 30 seconds every time I clicked a button. This went on for about a month with no help from Intuit. Finally, I figured out on my own that I needed to run the &#34;Validate and Repair...&#34; command to fix the issue. Quicken then proceeds to tell me that all of my previously hidden accounts are missing, and that it has deleted them. Since then, Quicken has been more responsive.<br /><br />However, I am still annoyed at the whole upgrade process and my deleted accounts. I am considering switching to another product when I am forced to upgrade again."
0,Have not gotten this security protection to work.....Have tried to download it several times....Now I cannot even get on the internet for some reason...Never had a problem until I tried to download this product...Considering returning it.
0,I am a digital artist and had to get a new computer. I had been using the Print Shop Deluxe 23.1 which I love! There was not a download for that so I had to purchase a different Print Shop I went with the 3.5 I can not do even half of what I could do in print shop 23.1. Every time I try to save a piece of artwork it says not enough memory try deleting some of your photos and then it just crashes and I loose everything I have been working on which takes several hours to create. I am so unhappy with this product. Is Broderbund ever going to have a downloadable version of 23.1 deluxe edition? I do hope so the 3.5 version is such a disappointment. I should say my new computer does not have a CD drive in it so I need a downloadable product. I will never recommend this product to anyone! And will be looking for something more usable. What a waste of money!
4,I have had Norton for many years. I'm so glad I found it on Amazon in a downloadable version. It's super easy to do and Amazon has the best price going.
1,"I switched to Quicken 2010 after Microsoft dumped MS Money last year.  I was fairly happy with Q2010, but thought an upgrade would be worthwhile...WRONG!  Download, install and conversion were relatively smooth except that it corrupted one of my real estate loans.  I did the whole process again with the same corruption.  I then had to find and delete 9 erroneous transactions and remove one erroneous scheduled bill reminder.<br /><br />The more serious problem has been that the program crashes for no apparent reason when entering certain transactions.  Remember, I am not a newbie to Quicken...this has only been happening since the 2011 upgrade.<br /><br />Also, there are several layout and report features of Q2011 that are gone or have been significantly modified to the point where I am seriously considering reverting to the 2010 version.<br /><br />In conclusion, my strong recommendation would be not to upgrade now...maybe they will fix some of these bugs.  If you are new to Quicken, buy the 2010 discounted version."
2,"I've used TurboTax for many years now. The program is easy to use with good walk through steps and help topics. Excellent deduction walk through. Support is helpful and easy to reach. TurboTax is one of the premier tax services. Sounds like five stars so far but where it gets annoying is there are several other products on the market now at a lower price. Most aren't as good but that depends upon how complex your taxes are. Lastly, when you are finally done with the whole mess that is taxes you are asked to pay for electronic filing for anything beyond the federal filing. Further, while you can figure our how to print for snail mail filing, it's somewhat hidden away and cumbersome - haven't you already paid enough? Especially given this years fiasco with the reduced features in the package and the backpedaling."
1,"2 stars only because it is soooo user unfriendly to find, download, and install. Cheap tho'."
4,Very good product.
1,"[edited March 16 2013 to make review more helpful]<br /><br />I think that most of us know what to expect from Microsoft Office, so I'm focusing this review on the functionality of the installation / DRM, with a few comments on the software product itself.  I feel justified focusing this review on the DRM because when you buy this product you're basically only buying a password.  You can enter this password into the trial version of MS Office 2010 to convert it into a full version.  The trial version comes pre-installed on many new computers, or you can probably download for free, or you can definitely download once you purchase this item.<br /><br />It is pretty awesome that Amazon tracks the password for you.  You can get it anytime from your Amazon account.  However, it doesn't help the rating because this is a benefit provided by Amazon not by Microsoft Office.<br /><br />=====================================================<br />The installation / DRM:<br />(DRM = Digital Right Management)<br />=====================================================<br /><br />I was dissatisfied with the DRM because I wound up spending a lot of time and energy because I needed to install the product (legitimately) twice.  I had to install it twice because I installed it once on a laptop that I had to return.  When I bought the password for Office I knew that I was going to have to uninstall it and transfer the license, so I carefully read the product details to make sure that I would be able to do this.  It was possible to do the transfer, but it was much harder than I expected and than it needed to be.<br /><br />If you're going to buy only the rights to software, the manufacturer should make it easy for you to manage those rights. This software is not cheap, and I want to know that after I buy it that I can be confident that I have the rights to use this software according to the terms and agreements.<br /><br />However, Microsoft (not too surprisingly) didn't make it easy to manage my software license.<br /><br />There was no way to deactivate the original installation of the software, and I spent a lot of time searching for this option.  I used the help in MS Office, and direct searches on google that searched the general web and Microsoft's site, but I never found anything.  Using the help in Office is frustrating and time consuming, and not helpful.<br /><br />Without a way to deactivate the original software, I simply uninstalled it.  I figured that since it was a MS product in an MS operating system this might do the trick, but it didn't.<br /><br />When I installed the product a second time it didn't detect that I had uninstalled the original, so it wouldn't let me activate the new product initially.  I had to call Microsoft's activation hotline to activate the software.  As I recall, the hotline is completely automated, but not a 24 hour hotline, which seems to me like another senseless annoyance.  The hotline process involved waiting, and pressing buttons, and waiting, and eventually entering a ridiculously long and complex series of letters and numbers into their form in the software.<br /><br />The only reason that I can imagine that Microsoft wouldn't have an option to deactivate the software is because they're hoping that some people will be frustrated or confused and just buy a new one.  This is the kind of thing that Apple likes to do, and I don't like the trend of Microsoft trying to be more like Apple.  It's ok to be a boring but reliable commodity!<br /><br />In short, I spent time / energy<br />1) Researching the ability to transfer the rights before my purchase<br />2) Trying (fruitlessly) to deactivate the first installation<br />3) Trying to activate the second installation<br /><br />=====================================================<br />The product:<br />=====================================================<br /><br />Overall, I like Office 2010 better than 2007, but I miss Office 2003.<br /><br />** Office 2010 vs 2007 **<br /><br />It seems to be a little more stable, intuitive, and have higher performance.  Also, the feature bloat wasn't too bad in 2007 to 2010, like it was from 2003 to 2007.  There are some subtle touches that improve usability, but nothing dramatic... which is a good thing.  MS Office is something that I simply want to rely on and use, not something that I want to completely relearn every few years.<br /><br />With Office 2010 they introduce yet another case of limited backwards compatibility.  Now when I save a Word document created (or maybe just edited?) in 2007 it doesn't save, but rather it asks me bewildering questions about compatibility that imply that I will corrupt my document by simply saving it.  Really?  Again?  I don't want to become an expert in MS color palettes, templates, or use of normal.dot, I just want to send someone a memo.<br /><br />Microsoft, please stop trying to artificially introduce backwards incompatibility to increase sales.  It's really annoying, and we know that you're doing it.<br /><br />** Office 2010 vs 2003 **<br /><br />This was such a mixed bag, and it's already been discussed to death.  However, ya'll weren't finding my original review helpful, so maybe you'll like this...<br /><br />Excel:<br />I could probably do a thesis on this, but here's a short list<br />Great: we can open / create bigger spreadsheets, and the conditional highlighting is super duper.<br />Not great: just about everything else.<br /> - Pivot tables went from being an amenity for power users to becoming something that nobody understands.<br /> - The ribbon is interesting, but still annoying and unnecessary.<br /> - It's confusing that the \\""developer tab\\"" comes hidden by default.<br /> - Charts are now extremely slow (much slower that 2003) for data sets that are not even that big<br /> - Speaking of 2003, it's hard to keep multiple installations of Office.  It would be nice to have 2003 inside 2007 and 2010<br /> - It suddenly became hard to see which sheets are highlighted / selected, so now I'm frequently editing multiple sheets without realizing it and ruining hours of work.<br /> - But the biggest problem is definitely the overall bloat<br />The new excel has way too many new functions.  Many new functions should simply be a combination of existing simpler functions.  They also introduce new backwards incompatibility and unneeded complexity.  VBA is the worst part.  There are no so many ways to do things in VBA that it's very hard to find the simple methods to just do stuff.  Recording a macro used to make something intelligible that you could re-purpose, but now it's an exercise in futility.  The one thing that VBA needed was a nicer IDE, and did we get that?  Nope.  Do you know who did get a nicer IDE?  R. (Yes, that's the letter R.  If you don't know what R is you can google it.)  R is about the only thing I use anymore, which means that all my time invested in being great at Excel is mostly down the tubes.<br /><br />Word:<br />Like Excel it's even harder to do simple things.  For example, it's hard to make a document single spaced and hard to make that the default (although I think this got a little easier again in 2010).  Also, the whole new paradigm that every word document is a separate application window (but not actually an independent application) is so extremely stupid.<br /><br />PowerPoint:<br />This is the one bright spot.  It's gotten better and better with every iteration.  PowerPoints still look like \\""PowerPoints\\"", but that's not so bad; at least it works!  If Microsoft decides to make some swanky application to make infographics that don't look like PowerPoint, I hope they put it in something besides PowerPoint.  Maybe publisher?  Nobody's using that anyway.<br /><br />Publisher:<br />Haha, just kidding!  I don't even remember if I bought it.<br /><br />Access:<br />I never liked Access; it's confusing, slow, and hard to use.  As computers have gotten faster and storage has gotten cheaper, Access has stood firm in it's limited ability.  It's still going to take forever to do the simplest things no matter how many processors you have.  I don't think I bought it for 2010, so I'm really just reviewing 2003 and 2007.  There are so many free options that are fast and efficient and connect to Excel that it's really only the most sadistic manager that forces Access on anyone.<br /><br />The Help (all applications):<br />The online help is unbelievably awful, especially for VBA.  You pretty much have to use the online help (which is the default) because they've actually taken documentation out of the installed help.  The installed documentation that is left behind is riddled with errors, missing examples that used to be there, and has weird formatting errors everywhere.  The online help is also so bizarre, confusing, and useless.  There are filters to decide where to search, but the search doesn't work.  It's like the internet, but not as effective.  Also, you now get all kinds of different products returned at once, so you can't just find help on one thing like \\""functionality in Word\\"".  Any search is likely to take you to places that are devoted to downloading community templates or clip art rather than telling you something useful like \\""how to print in a booklet format\\"" or \\""how SUM handles N/A! values\\"".<br /><br />So, I was a little offended that only 1/3 people found my review helpful, so I rewrote and extended it.  It's much longer that anything I would like to read, but my review isn't for me it's for the people!<br /><br />I do hope you'll find this useful, but if you don't please let me know why in the comments, thanks"
1,"Long time users of TurboTax will likely be like me and &#34;need&#34; to buy this version. Sadly, it continues the tradition of removing features and getting harder to use each year. Years past included plenty of useful help features (if the Federal Instructions are available in this year's version I sure can't find them) but this years version just tells you there is a problem with your return and leaves you wondering how to resolve it with no useful instructions at all. The import from previous years appears to fails to import all the required data and then complains about the lack of a value imported from the previous year. Simply viewing a topic in the guided mode will mark it as complete if you have to jump out to look at something else and and return to the guided mode (you are taken to the next &#34;topic&#34; when you return). Unless you know to go back to the incomplete topic, you may never find out that you missed it. The application is frustrating to use and my confidence in the final return is shaken to say the least. Fortunately my returns are getting simpler each year because TurboTax appears to be getting more &#34;simple minded&#34; each year."
4,Easy and fast disk cloning my new SSD migration.
4,"It took a little while for me to get it set up. I ended up going to a quick books expert that helped me get all of my documents set up and learn how to run the system, however a littler exploring and you could figure it out on your own"
2,"Was confused when I bought it, turned around and get it again with the Office. :("
1,I bought MacFlux for my new iMac and its very buggy and now I come to find out a month later that I need to upgrade to the latest version of MacFlux.  A version that is more expensive than the $79 version I purchased in the first place.  There should have been a warning not to install on the new iMac! How bout a free upgrade to fix this product?!?
0,Efile did not work...tried updating (twice) but had no luck getting it to work.  Efile was one of the reasons I bought this package and it was useless.
4,It has help me file taxes and i have used H&R Block tax software and it predecessor for about 10 years
3,It did the job in a well structured program. I was lead through the process in an orderly fashion. I recommend this product.
3,Easy to download and use.  Came with free federal files.  I use to do my small business taxes and this seems to get me the most refund back.
2,"It's too bad that quicken has such poor Tech Support. But if you need this type of software there is really no other source. Just hope you don't have to call for support. It does do the job, but just barely. The annual updates add usually addt no real value to the product. But the cost keeps going up. That is what lack of competition causes."
4,Great product for the price. Does what I need without the extra that the higher priced programs have.
2,"I actually used this program maybe 20 years ago and purchased it for my son, it's still a great learning tool. But the application is buggy: I can't launch the application until I closed all open applications or it crashes (I'm running 10.6).<br /><br />The other thing I find annoying (and reminds me of really old programs) is on launch the applications has to change the screen resolution, it makes me think the program was designed for a 640x480 screen.<br /><br />But once you get the application going it's still a great teaching tool. In the lower right is a representation of your hands over the keyboard that show's correct hand positions and it shows the key you hit. The lessons are progressive, adding keys as you go along and they make learning fun. They also have arcade games that my 10 year old son enjoys.<br /><br />I started out my son on some free online typing games but they don't shoe proper hand positions and the games aren't progressive or flexible. Mavis Beacon is still a strong learning tool but it needs to be rewritten for today's computers to earn 5 stars."
2,"First off, I'll say that I am a fan of Lightroom and have been using it since Version 3.  It is my go-to program for importing / editing / storing photos both from my Canon DSLR and my family's smartphones.<br /><br />However, I was unhappy about how long Adobe took to fix glaring issues in their previous Lightroom 5, and now Adobe's new policies for Lightroom 6 are another thorn in my side.  Specifically, the policy that standalone versions of Lightroom 6 will get no feature updates is just a poor way to treat new and long-time Lightroom customers.<br /><br />Looking at updates to the *previous* Lightroom 5, there were bug fixes of course, but Lightroom also gained the following functions:<br />- Lightroom 5.2: added Feather control for the Clone/Heal brush, added Smoothness adjustment slider for Color Noise Reduction.<br />- Lightroom 5.4: added support for Lightroom Sync.<br />- Lightroom 5.7: added integrated Aperture/iPhoto importer.<br />Nothing huge, but definitely some useful features.<br /><br />Now with Lightroom 6, features added to the CC (subscription) version are being specifically excluded from the standalone product.  The first of these is the Dehaze slider, but I guess there will be others in the future.  And once again my opinion of a good product is marred by the poorly thought out and greedy policies of Adobe.  I'm not sure what the correct policy is - but I do know that the current policy is the wrong one.<br /><br />I've read in a few places that Adobe claims the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 prevents them from adding new features to products already paid for.  However, this flies in the face of real world examples from the small (Angry Birds supplying many new levels for the initial 99 cent purchase) to the quite large (Microsoft giving all Windows 7 and Windows 8 users a free copy of Windows 10).  You need a better excuse, Adobe.<br /><br />Edit - if you've own a previous version of Lightroom *do not* buy the Full version here - buy the Upgrade version directly from Adobe and save $70.version directly from Adobe and save $70."
3,Just buy a new edition every year to keep your financials up to date and track your investments. Great for tax preparation.
1,Unfortunately this software doesn't support images and multi-column layouts. In addition organizing text is extremely time consuming and difficult. If these issues are corrected this software would rate 4 or 5 stars.
4,Used this program for a number of years and it is simple to use for both my income and my investments.
2,it was difficult to use
4,"With Avast free, I never have a problem with pesky viruses. Plus, it helps me keep my software up to date."
4,"I had bought my wife a prior backup program.  We couldn't figure out what it saved because it encoded all the data it purportedly saved.  She gave up on it.  I got a hard drive and a Clickfree Automatic Backup software program.  She was reluctant to use it, but we finally installed it.  Once in a while I would hook up the external hard drive and do a backup.  Then the hard drive failed. :-(<br /><br />We had some priority files we needed from the old computer so I hooked up our old netbook to the external hard drive.  Not sure what I'd find, but Clickfree creates a little retrieval program right on the hard drive.  It allows you to restore all or part of your image, to the old location or to a new location you can specify.  Best of all, you can actually do your search easily and see if the files are there!  I retrieved the files I needed easily and did what I needed to do.<br /><br />Next, we got a different computer, and I was able to set up a complete restore in a matter of minutes; the restore completed in less than two hours.  My only problem was that the new computer didn't have the same partitioning as the old one so I had a few things to process manually.  But they were all there, it all worked!<br /><br />My only complaints are minor.  There is apparently some limit on the length of pathnames for restores; I had some long folder names and had to shorten them to get the selective restore to work.  The other small issue is that Clickfree offers to use anything you plug in as a backup drive.  This includes memory sticks, iPods, etc.  There's probably some way to specify what the backup drive is wanted, but it is a little annoying to have to tell it \\""no, don't use this\\"" every time you plug in a different device.  Still, the restore worked great when I needed it, and that's the real objective of a backup program."
4,"I love the comfort of knowing I have entered all the needed information, and that TurboTax did all the calculations correctly."
3,With all the issues that TurboTax encountered this year I decided to delay purchasing the product until later in the year.  Intuit seemed to resolve the issues and I found this edition easier to use than the 2013 edition.  I've used TurboTax for many years and I didn't want to change.  Giving them time to fix the issues worked out for me. I'm going to try them again next year as I hope they have learned from their mistakes.
0,Don't buy it..!
1,"The software does many things that I was looking for, budget and goals, short or long. But the software requires that you link into all of your bank accounts to be able to review your spending and saving habits. I don't trust putting my user id and password into the software for my banks. So will not be using the product."
3,I have been using Turbotax for years and what a great product.  Easily loads information from last year to this year while asking questions about life changes.  Guides me through the entire income and deduction parts and doesn't miss a thing.  Could be a little cheaper in price when compared to other tax prep software.  Not having to go to a store a buy it when I can sit at home and download the software was worth it's weight in gold!  Saves gas also!
1,"I upgraded from 2012 to 2014 and found that there were very few improvements and I lost much of the functionality I had previously enjoyed. Most hot key short cuts (ctl-D; ctl-R, etc) only work occasionally. Customized reports I had created no longer work at all. Reconciling brokerage accounts saves nothing if it is interrupted and it does not realize we usually do this on a monthly basis. In short, it is even more quirky than it has been since I started using it about 10 years ago. The 'one step update' still takes about 3 steps.<br />In short, if you don't need to update because they stop supporting some function, avoid it. If someone knows a good competing product, please let me know. Competition is a good thing."
2,"This product wasn't quite what I expected it to be. I was looking for an audio editor with the ability to build music with samples, or enhance existing music. While you can take tracks from a CD, I could find no way to load an mp3 file. This took about 60% of what I wanted it for away. As to assembling music samples to create music, in spite of the large collections provided, the samples are lackluster and even campy. It's hip hop vocal samples sound like something that might turn up on the Lawrence Welk Show. As a toy to pass the time with, Music Maker is passable, but I can't see anyone turning out a serious mix tape with it. I could be wrong, that's just how I feel after monkeying with it for about eight hours or so."
2,"QuickBooks Online Essentials overpromises. It's a decent solution for tracking my one-person business' finances, but intuitive and helpful it isn't. I've chosen to keep tracking invoices and cash manually because I can never be sure I've not mis-assigned or mis-interpreted something in QBO.<br /><br />There's a fairly steep learning curve, but fortunately it's easy (if time-consuming) to fix errors. The online help isn't context-sensitive and the assumptions the &#34;match&#34; feature makes are typically unhelpful, requiring vigilance to ensure that you don't regress.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have with the product is the embedded pitch for their pay-invoices-by-credit-card add-on service, which I was curious about but which led me down a multi-day rabbit hole because there was no confirmation screen. Suddenly I was subscribed to the service, without an email address or phone number to call to cancel. All I wanted was more info, and the moment I had that I knew the service (expensive and risky!) wasn't for me. I ended up having to fax them a &#34;terminate service&#34; notice, and fortunately they agreed to back out the charges.<br /><br />I keep QBO because of the Payroll feature, which is competitively priced and, once you've been through the multi-day hassle of setting it up, hard to justify abandoning. With luck, the payoff will come with saved time and worry during tax-filing season(s)."
3,The download was done without a glitch.  Everything works great.  I'm very satisfied with it.
0,Upgraded. Installed.  Program ran but would not synch with my bank.<br /><br />Completed three hours of online &#34;help&#34;<br /><br />Left me with program installed and an error to even get it back installed.<br /><br />Run away....
4,"Good, easy to use and understandable protection system."
3,"I like the new Quicken 2014, however I am having problems trying to downloads items from my accounts due to problems signing into Intiut,"
0,"For those accustomed to using financial software, this is as close to useless as it can be while still being better than nothing."
4,This software is a must have. You need to have an Anti virus software. This is one of the best on the market. I saved a lot of money by downloading it rather than buying it retail in the store. I would recommend this to others.
0,"After 18 years with Turbo Tax, I officially will switch and do my taxes on TaxACT.  Last year, I paid $39.99 for Turbo Tax Deluxe and then another $19.98 to efile my state taxes.  This year, Turbo Tax wants me to upgrade to Premier so I can file my schedule K.  They want $79.98 for Turbo Tax Deluxe and now want $39.98 to file my state.  Talk about greed.  They can spin it any way they want, but going from $59.98 last year to $119.98 this year is inexcusable for someone who has used their product for 18 years.  Nothing changed from my current income status.  The only change was Turbo Tax thinking I would just pay it. STAY AWAY FROM TURBO TAX.  There are other providers at less than half the cost and are just as good."
3,"I use to use Turbo Tax but since they changed this year I thought I would try H & R Block Tax Software. I am glad I did. It is a stressful time as it is without having to fork out alot of money, and this program is just as good as Turbo Tax and alot cheaper."
0,"I cannot give a star rating above a 1 (0 if VAILABLE) because I have been unable to download/ install it.  I have a new HP 2000 Workbook operating with a DSL Internet.  I go thru the process to download and the system tells me I am on a slow internet connection so it will take a long time.  I timed the download and after about 37 minutes the system tells me I now have OFFICE 2013.  I follow all the directions and eventually get a message stating I am ready to go.  Unfortunately, I can not find any of the OFFICE 2013 programs on my computer.  HP Support is, as I have found, is next to worthless."
4,Great software to manage your money with budgeting and an easy to use interface. Great price too through Amazon.
3,A person that I hired loaded it and I have been pleased. It gets the job done and I like the voice reminder that this software it getting the job done.
2,"As a professional artist/photographer, I had been using Photoshop Elements version 3 for many years. It was wonderful, with no issues whatsoever. I recently had to get a new computer which then required I get an up-to-date Photoshop Elements 12. This new version is totally idiotic or maybe I'm just stupid. It looks to me as if they intended this only for moms and pops jazzing up snapshots of the kids and printing them out at simple standard sizes. This version refuses to save any dimensions I enter for doing repeat orders for art prints under their \\""Custom\\"" setting. The older version not only saved everything but it also provided a constraint feature that showed the actual measurements. This new version doesn't. I absolutely hate this new version. It is taking me endless hours longer to print through this program. I will have to find something else. Sorry Adobe, but you goofed."
3,Got my refund back in record time.
4,"I have used this product for several years now and am still quite impressed with it.  A true WYSIWHG program.  Relative easy learning curve.  Full extent of features. Don't let the price fool you.  Select an object, right click the mouse and the most useful actions pull up to choose from.  A complete suit of products are available: including DrawPlus, PhotoPlus, PagePlus, etc. similar to the Corel line of products. Each of these fully integrate within this program as well. This suite has been rated very highly in Europe and is finally starting to make a notice in the USA in recent years.    Try the free demo on Serif's web site.  But, why waste your time, you'll end of buying it anyway. Might as well just buy it now.  Excellent Forum support by user's with lot's of excellent ideas and tips.  Excellent customer support if needed."
2,"Problems With Down Load,  My anti-virus program stopped download  said it contained a virus. I deleated every thing and purchased a hard copy. The hard copy worked fine, got a refund, was surprised with that."
0,"bought & paid for the software.  installed it and when it came to activation with supplied key it all went down hill fast from there.  spent hours on the phone, on hold with microsoft.<br />never again from amazon."
2,"I would love nothing more than to give this product a 5 star but it doesn't do what I bought it for. I was looking for something to make my own soundtracks by taking vocals out of a song but with this, you can still hear the vocals there just muffled. However it does work great if a soundtrack you already have is to low or to high. You can lower it or raise it so that you can sing it how you feel comfortable. My only problem with that is there's kind of a humming sound once you burn it on a disc. It's not very noticeable to others. I had to point it out to the girl I sing in church with."
4,I'm AVAST user for over 2 years<br />It works perfectly<br />It works effectively and friendly<br />And its basic version is FREE!!
1,"I purchased this software to use with an account on our computer which does not have administrative privileges.  The program will not sync from this account, and it won't save if I sync from another account.  Also, it opens on start up even when this option is turned off.  I wouldn't recommend this software if you have multiple users on your computer."
3,"Grateful for all of the reviews I read while researching a replacement personal finance program, it's time for me to return the favor.  I reviewed several programs including: Money, iBank4, and MoneyWell.  There were 2 themes in the reviews that helped me the most: establish a clear understanding of what's most important to you in the daily use of a finance program, and take advantage of the free trial usage most of the companies have to offer.  In my case, I chose iBank4 because it matched my needs for tracking multiple cash and credit accounts and basic investment management.  I am very pleased with my decision; iBank4 is serving my needs extremely well.  I have one minor annoyance in that it does not give me the ability to filter out reconciled transactions when viewing the account transactions."
3,"PaintShop Pro X is an easy to use photo editor.  It contains many of the features of much higher priced photo editors, but at a fraction of the price.  It is a very stable product.  It has a good help file and there are clips on Youtube to show you how to do higher level work.  The layer interface is excellent.  I love editing old photos and scans with this software."
4,"Good product ,fast shipping , right price"
1,Quicken would not allow me to import my 2013 records because they were done in Quicken Deluxe 2013. I do not need the Deluxe version and a review that I read said he had no problem importing (same scenario) so I purchased this one then ended up having to upgrade to the 2015 Deluxe Version (which by the way still has some major bugs that need worked out!) which cost me almost $20 more than if I would have purchased the Deluxe Version outright.  I couldn't tell you if this version of the Starter Edition is good or not but I don't like what Intuit has done!!
1,I can't believe Turbotax did this!  I have been a annual user of turbotax for 15 years.  Now I have to spend an extra $30 because I bought and sold ONE stock in 2014.  Give me a break!  I read an article H&R block is providing a free copy of their software as long as you provide proof of the Turbotax software.  Its worth a try!  This could be my last year with turbotax due to Corporate greed.
4,This is a nice easy to use protection program. The download was easy and painless plus didnt take a great amount of time. I have had no problems at all with my computer since this was installed.
1,"OK at first, then I had to upgrade for another feature. Then I had to go to a whole new version to do investment tax reporting. I ended up spending about $80. for turboTax and a lot more complexity.  I hope I'm not audited.  I think there are hidden errors in my return."
3,"I used to use TaxCut, but their support and QA on the Mac platform was abysmal.  After using this for a few years I feel it's accurate for the most part.  The simpler your tax needs the better, though."
4,Expensive but better than the company's price.
3,"Excellent product.<br /><br />The amazon instructions were ok; you might have to fiddle with the interface to find your software. I called the helpdesk and they helped me quickly. So, I take away one star for shoddy interface."
0,The download was fine. Then the problems & headaches started. The conversion was a nightmare! My accounts showed open balances where there were none. My Assets doubled and tripled. Net worth multiplied. I wish I could take it to the bank!!!<br />Do not waste your time or money unless you are a magician. I would like to get my money back..
0,doesn't do me any good if I can't download it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"I've used the PC version of this program.  This is far, far easier to use.  Perhaps it because it doesn't do as much.  Yet it does more than enough for me.  In a sense, this is like QB Lite.  I like the version."
0,"Okay - for working great and helping me with my taxes (for many years) I should honstely rate this a 6 out of 5. However, I cannot bring myslef to suggest that anything about taxes is good.  That this product exists, I am greatful... that I need this - suxs.  It is what it is."
2,"Quicken 2015 for Mac has modest ambitions, but that's a vast improvement over its predecessors.  Begrudging acceptance of the MAC world?  Given the limited ambitions, it performs extremely well and is strong in ease of use."
3,"I think this Dragon app works really well.  I have a southern accent and I do try to enunciate some but it catches most of what I say the first time. It is so much better than the free windows 8 speech recognition software as I expected.  I continue to build the database of acronyms and other words that are specific to my work and it catches those as I use them.  I began using it almost immediately without a great deal of time needed to get started doing the basics and it's easy to find commands that you need to learn.<br />I have downloaded the Android microphone app and that works really well too, I'm guessing the microphone in my smartphone is pretty good (since it is a phone, right?).  I like having the option of using it versus the headset that I bought separately since I downloaded the software.  I was a little concerned about spending $100 on an app I knew nothing about, but it paid off as I use it to take notes on large amounts written information.  The only missing star is due to the long time is takes to update after a session before you can close the app, I wish it could do this in the background or do it more quickly."
0,I wanted to be able to make several cards for different persons.  The program did not work.<br />I got several error messages and I never got it to work.
1,Folks believe when they say it is for beginners. If you've ever gotten wet you probably already know as much as this app will teach.
2,Does what it's supposed to do.  Intuit is the worst company to deal with. Intuit support is the worst.  If there were any other reasonable alternative software I wrote switch in a heartbeat.
0,"I bought the downloadable Quickbooks and the activation code does not work. I need one that actually works, it locked me out of the program."
0,"In my opinion, Quicken 2013 is useless. It does not allow you to track a paycheck in the budget.  I asked Intuit about this problem and was told they recognize the problem but do not have a fix for it yet nor did they know when the problem would be fixed.  The version of Quicken I was using is no longer supported.  I asked if I could get a complimentary version of the last one (other than 2013) that was supported until the problem was fixed and was told no. Because of this experience I intend to never buy an Intuit product including Turbo Tax again."
0,"The software charged me for a state e-file, and then tried to charge an additional fee to take it from my returns. Another $45 for the privilege of e-filing state? So I changed to a credit card to pay for the e-file. I was then told that I had to print a form and send a check to the state... even though I paid for e-filing?<br /><br />An Intuit rep told me that my taxes WERE e-filed correctly, and that I did not need to mail a check. Now I've invested way more time trying to sort out the mess than if I'd just mailed taxes. Fix your customer messages, and stop trying to grab more off this already-too-expensive piece of software.<br /><br />Watch what you check, or you'll get charged for any number of services Intuit tries to stick you with."
2,I am a long tim user of quicken for windows. I have been using Quicken 2015 fro Mac for a few weeks now. Basic checkbook appears to work. I can't say as much about tracking investments. I figure I have to invest several hours fixing the data import. Need a rainy day to tackle that.<br /><br />I am totally amazed that Quicken for Mac lags so far behind the level of the Windows version. I have paid for many version of Quicken and this is the third version for Mac that I have tried.
3,Having been a fan of Kaspersky for many years I became frustrated with the performance.  I still use it on some systems but for several months have been using Bitdefender Total Security on a couple of systems.  I have been very pleased with it both in regard to protection and performance.  I highly recommend it and only give it 4 stars because of the cost which is considerably higher that Kaspersky.  I still recommend both Kaspersky and Bitdefender as excellent A/V products but am tending toward Bitdefender for performance.
1,"I thought I would get a CD, which I did not.  When I tried to install it by simply downloading it it was a mess.  I hope I can get some one to get it downloaded for me."
4,I have used WEBROOT for 10 years when I started it was good now it is very very good.<br />I will never change from this software.<br />I have use most of the other brands ---- this is the real deal.
1,Too many problems with Turbo tax soft ware. Unlikely to use again. Poor customer service.
0,"I was not able to giet it to work. adobe took over my laptop online, reinstalled photoshop elements 13, worked 5-6 hrs on it with me,but could not get it to work any better than i did"
3,Very good!
2,"It isn't worth the $70.00 to upgrade from the 2012 version. It doesn't seem that different or better.  I was happy with the 2012 version, so I feel I shouldn't have upgraded and saved $70.00."
3,I upgrade Quicken every year and have been using the product for more than 15 years.  They continue to make mostly small improvements from year to year.  I have never archived my data file and the program works fine.
3,"Used turbo tax for about 20 years. Easy to use, great product, need patience to work through all the questions."
2,Always make sure I have one!
4,I feel very thankful and secure with avast. I recommend it to friends and family. May you Avast workers all be blessed.
3,So far it seems to be working--although I had to load it on twice as it gave me warnings the first time that it was shutting down.
3,"I recently purchased the downloaded version of QforMac and have found this to be a reasonable improvement to the previous versions.  The main difference is the mobility which is nice and simple.  Reports still have a ways to go, but they work for simple analysis.  The budget feature could be more functional and the entry calculator still needs some work.  All in all, this is a good simple, functional tracking tool that allows you to maintain control of your personal financial situation."
2,My Quicken 2010 would be slow and most of the time not download my financial and bank data stating that I canceled the transaction......I didn't. I continue to receive a popup when loading Qucken that did advertise Quicken 2013 now it is asking me to download another thing...Yes I have unclicked the remind me later button. Quicken 2013 does the same. I just tolorate it.
1,"We paid for the business version because my SO was a contractor for much of last year. My primary reason for 2 stars is that even with the added price it didn't help much vs. the other &#34;deluxe&#34; version I used last year. All these different price levels feel like Intuit is trying to skim the market and get people to pay more than they should need to. I also wasn't impressed that I was charged to e-file state (twice, once for each of us), and that there was an additional fee to use the deduction to pay the fees."
4,Been a long time  user of turbotax with this years process  easier than  ever.  Repetitive use allows for easy data replication of key data points from the previous year's  return.  The  structure is also extremely easy to follow while allowing you to edit specific forms as required.  The electronic filing is also a breeze.  Kudos to a well engineered simplified solution
1,"Difficult to use.  Haven't used quicken in like 15 years or more.  This product seems to have a much steeper learning curve to use, and I am computer and tech savvy and still haven't figured this product out.  Seems as though every function I try to do I have to research on google for an hour to figure it out. I estimate I will need 40 hours to get familiar with this program...and I don't want to invest that much time in it.  The very basic quicken I used many years ago was a much more useful product to me."
0,"This software is 100% unusable.<br /><br />Memorized Payees are not remembered or half remembered or just don't work.<br />Editing transaction register logs sometimes works.<br />Even more annoying is to change a register log then notice minutes later that it was changed back to the original.  There is a complete loss of confidence that the software is retaining entries and a constant fear that this thing is going to get you audited after you submit your Schedule C.<br /><br />I tried, I really tried to make this work.  I spent 20+ hours getting this set up and failed.  I engaged tech support and spent 7+ hours with one call back and they offered zero helpful resolutions.  The tech support is not equipped to handle any issues other than reinstall (which I did) or try another setup file (which I did multiple times).<br /><br />Tech support abandoned the ticket and just stopped calling me back. #150214-001185.<br /><br />At no time did the software ever once balance any account I added to it.  This software can not even add 2 + 2.<br />I've done Intuit TurboTax for five years but after this experience I've already bought H&R Block software.<br /><br />In lieu of using this software I find it actually easier to run my business in Microsoft Excel.<br />I'm so disgusted by this product that I will not renew my Amazon Prime subscription and will boycott all of Amazon for more than one year as punishment for selling an unusable product with no return policy.  It appears that Amazon is just in it for the quick cash now. So sad."
1,"This year we decided to try the downloadable version, but it wasn't a simple download. You had to download a \\""downloader\\"" and then use that to download your software. You're then asked what PC you want to use the software on. Long story short: Get the real thing and just be patient: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RS8FBE?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8 ...especially if you hate installing crap on your PC just to handle a simple task, especially downloading software, and if you want to avoid the burdens imposed by Digital Rights Management (DRM).<br /><br />I downloaded the software on a different computer than I intended to use the software on. While in the end, I got the download, it didn't go to my ideal location, and I had to hunt around a bit to find it in EXE format.<br /><br />Just say no to bloatware! Are the few bucks you save worth the extra nonsense?<br /><br />Regarding TurboTax itself, you get all the extra resources with the CD that you don't get with the downloadable software, so you won't have to waste your time digging around for answers on Intuit's sales-oriented (not support-oriented) website. I do wish this was available as an online-offering like the rest of the TurboTax series though.<br /><br />Finally, if you don't own a corporation, all you really need is the Home + Business version (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RS8F8W?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8), as TurboTax Business is more Corporation-oriented than it is small-business or self-employment oriented.<br /><br />I hope I've helped!"
2,First time using this software had problems printing the forms.
0,"Brand new download on a new computer, and crashes every time I open an invoice. Tech support forums are no help. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
2,"Bought this to upgrade the Mobile app and it does not work with my Credit Union and Quicken tech support is terrible all they want to do is trade e-mails all day, no phone calls as requested. I am still not able to communicate with my credit union. Waste of money."
1,"I upgraded from Quicken Deluxe 2010 as I wanted to use the downloads from my bank. That worked okay but when I tried to use the Home Inventory it wouldn't work. Called customer service (CS) and they spent about an hour trying to get it to work. The CS rep finally said, \\""Sorry I can't help you but Home Inventory will not work with Windows 7 64 bit.\\"" I told him I was using it with Quicken 2010. He asked me if I'm sure if I was using it with Windows 7 64-bit. I told him I only have one computer and it was working. I told him the side of the box says it will work with Windows 7 32 AND 64-bit OS. He repeated that it will not work with 64 bit and it is a known issue. WHAT! Why waste my time troubleshooting if it is a known issue. How about not putting on the box that is \\""DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 7 64-BIT!\\"" I went through the same BS on another upgrade when I first bought the separate Home Inventory and it wouldn't work with the Windows upgrade. They told me they were not going to have a patch to fix the issue. The Quicken fix was to for me to buy Quicken Deluxe with Home Inventory. Now I'm back to square one. I have all of my household items in Quick Home Inventory and no way to get to it and Quicken will not fix the issue."
2,"I like the protection this software provides but I am very frustrated with the lack of options available to adjust internet & website alerts.  After wasting much time tweaking all of the settings available, I can't get the custom filtering I want.  This product would be great for people that just want basic protection and don't mind MANY pop up alerts."
4,"I never used Photoshop before so I'm looking forward to learning how it works, and I'm looking forward to doing so.  I've  looked through rhe manual and it aooears to be a excellent resource for a newbie like me."
0,The software did not move Windows 7 applications to new Windows 7 PC as advertised.  It was succesful with about 30% of the applications.  Wasted numerous hours with this software.  I contacted PC Mover and they did not give a hoot.  Basically said &#34;Too bad buddy&#34;.
0,"I had ordered the Garmin nuMaps Lifetime Map Update so I could get a newer version of the 2008 Garmin North American City Navigator.  I was able to download it to my home computer but when I tried to link my Garmin Etrex Venture HC GPS, I was told that it didn't have enough memory to accept the entire North American maps file.  There was nothing on either the Garmin nor the Amazon websites to warn you of this issue.  I would have been able to download parts of the file to cover the area of the state I needed from the CD version but not the on line download.  Amazon was kind enough to understand my dilemma so I did get the purchase credited back to my account. Thanks Amazon.    So, a word to the wise: Check with the GPS manufacturer before downloading maps software to be sure that your GPS is compatible.  There may not be any warning on the product description about this problem."
3,"Until this year, I was a loyal TurboTax user. For as long as I can remember using software to help do my taxes, I've used TurboTax. When Intuit pulled that lousy stunt of raising prices, and shifting the investment support to their top-tier Turbo Tax product, I decided it was time to look elsewhere. Looking at the reviews on Amazon, hordes of folks like me were flocking to H&R Block software as an alternative to TurboTax with satisfactory or better results, so I thought I'd give it a try. For less than half the price of the comparable TurboTax product, this provided nearly the same user experience. It imported my TurboTax files from last year, and walked me through everything necessary to complete and file my federal return. H&R Block also says that audit support is included, where this is an add-on cost with TurboTax. I hope I don't get to try that feature out! All in all, a very good program that gets the job done. Maybe it's because I've used another product for so many years, but I stopped at four stars because, while it did what I expected, it didn't &#34;wow&#34; me. Plus it gives me room to increase the rating when I'm back next year (unless next year H&R Block tries to pull the same stuff Turbo Tax did this year)."
2,"Standard tax software.<br /><br />HRB doesn't give you online tax people to help though, you have to go to an office.<br /><br />Overall, wont' use again.  When I pay for tax software I expect online tax help and less confusing software.  The reason I'm buying this is because I don't understand how to do taxes, the software doesn't do a good job of dumbing down actual terms, just the process."
1,"I've used H&R Block for years, and though problems, still the best I've found, though it was frustrating the tricks played to get me to upgrade.<br />But this year--look at all the 1-star reviews because of Obamacare--having us wait for a March update, only to be told we can't do it with this software and must get personal H&R service?! No apology, or refund? There is no excuse for such a trick.<br /><br />So I checked IRS, used Freefile (from the IRS link), and was amazed at how easy it was! It used to be only for low-income, but it looks like anyone can use it now. There were no ads, nothing intrusive, and it was straightforward--in many ways easier than H&R Block! Not as fancy looking (looks like you're filling out a regular form), but it does the math. I did my return and my mom's, and both were returned by the IRS for very minor errors within an hour or so--but it was easy to fix in a couple of minutes, I resubmitted, and both were accepted. H&R Block, by contrast, often had me get to the very end, and then found errors that were almost impossible to fix.<br /><br />Thanks, IRA, for Freefile. Easy, free, secure. Looks like no more H&R Block or TurboTax for me. Give it a try. Just go to IRA site and click the link for Freefile (freefilefillableforms dot com)"
0,"I spent hours and hours creating a PhotoBook and Video when we returned from an Costa Rican adventure trip where we had &#62;2,000 photos and &#62;2.5 hours of video.  I researched great photo and video software and selected Adobe.  While there are many excellent aspects, it all falls apart at the point of final production.  To the designers of this software set, I have to ask &#34;Really?&#34;  I created a 50 page 12 x 12 an amazing photobook and there is no way to customize the spine and back cover?  And no warning before I get started?  There are no options other than it to print in white the cover and spine in white?  I worked with both Adobe & Shutterfly helpdesks and there was no solution.  From now on, I am using the Shutterfly software directly.  Also, I have more than 10,000 iTunes songs that I legitimately own ... and no way to use those in 30 minutes of video that I had cut down from more than 2.5 hours.  I could not successfully download their music software after countless tries.  I researched and learned that I couldn't do what I wanted to do anyway with music (which seems so basic - like customizing a spine and back cover!)  so I gave up.  All I can say is 'watch out.'  The more people I talk with about using Adobe, the more people I see throw their hands up in frustration.  I have yet to meet a fan.  Clearly, we, the frustrated ones, are not the ones writing the reviews.  Which is way I took the time today to do so.  What a waste of time and money.  I also tried to contact Adobe via their Facebook and helpdesk to complain.  No response."
4,Wow. Does everything I need and totally compatible. I use it for everything now. Highly recommend it over Pages and Microsoft office.
4,The 2015 version has the Web Cam alert when the web cam is in use.  Nice to know should an unauthorized person enables it. I have used Kaspersky for 4 years and I am happy with the product.
3,"Works great.  I'm running office on a 2007 imac with OSX 10.10.1.  Unfortunately Microsoft does not release Access to Mac users, and outlook does not sync well with Mac services (calendar, tasks, notes, email).  Otherwise a good product."
2,"Norton Security for one device is the latest incarnation of what was Norton Internet Security. Norton has revamped their retail security lineup with the home line simplified to pretty much Norton Security with or without backup.<br /><br />Just ONE Please...:<br />This item has licensing for just ONE Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) or Android device. If you ONLY have one device this is fine, but if you have even two you are much better getting the 5 device version of [[ASIN:B00MHZ6Z64 Norton Security]] or 10 device [[ASIN:B00MHZ71G2 Norton Security with Backup]] which should be enough for many families.<br /><br />Whether you get the 1, 5 or 10 device license version it is the same product. Depending on the device there are differing feature sets. For example, IOS devices get no antivirus. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.<br /><br />Windows Setup:<br />Windows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is hard to find in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to white-list specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me until I finally found it deep in the settings.<br /><br />In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is less &#34;noisy&#34; than previous versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I didn't perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.<br /><br />Application Compatibility Problems:<br />I use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox was unable to start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products (including [[ASIN:B00JKZPTPC Norton Small Business]]). I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release (as of Oct. 1, 2014). This virtual machine is critical to my business so I was happy to finally resolve this. This is the only application compatibility problem I've come across so far.<br /><br />NOTE: As of Late February Virtual Box seems to work fine again with the mainstream releases IF you disable Norton Security during installation.<br /><br />How About Norton Security WITH Backup:<br />If you want an integrated on-line backup solution or have more than 5 devices, you might want to consider getting [[ASIN:B00MHZ71G2 Norton Security with Backup]] it supports 10 devices and includes 25GB of online backup space. Windows 7 Pro has a very capable backup program that works well with USB or network drives as backup media. The difference in price it might be well spent if you need online backup and/or more than 5 devices.<br /><br />Mobile Support:<br />The IOS app is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:<br />1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4 a over a mile away from its actual location!!<br />2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number...<br />3) it has a &#34;scream&#34; function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise<br /><br />If the &#34;scream&#34; actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS support is pretty poor. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I don't have an android device to try this out.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br />This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good overall but has some issues. It finds things other antivirus solutions on my Windows 7 Pro PC did not and does not seem to slow things down for me. I had one application with a problem, but nothing else. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but buries the advanced controls deep in the settings.<br /><br />Overall Norton Security should be a good tradeoff for most home users.<br /><br />The ONE device license is not a bargain. These days, who has just one device?<br /><br />The software itself is a great product for most people. If you have more than 1 device get the 5 device version or the 10 device version if more than 5 or you want backup too.<br /><br />Because of the minor issues and relatively poor value compared to the multi-device Norton Security versions I'm giving Norton Security for 1 device just 3 stars.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone.ts is pretty good overall but has some issues.

2,"This version lacks some features that are on the higher priced packages. But, I don't miss those features. Interface with other programs is often slow and erratic. I use the simple word processor that comes with Dragon then cut and paste into other programs as needed. The bottom line is voice recognition. It is far from perfect but still quite useful for some one with clunky fingers like me. The program will often surprise me with what it can recognize faithfully, and also surprises me with what it doesn't know or doesn't reproduce faithfully. It is a mix. I don't think the learning feature works very well. I try to train it to recognize certain words but he program often ignores me and defaults to the undesired response. For people who type very well this program may be more of an intrusion than a help."
4,"I have used Quicken since its inception in the early 1990s (does anyone remember DOS?). Each subsequent update makes the program easier and more comprehensive, and is extremely helpful at tax time."
4,I do have to say and agree with the 1 star rating people that it was a crappy thing for Intuit to do. I did purchase a version higher from last year and caved in. But Turbo Tax has been a great product for me - ever since I first purchased it on floppy media. Amazon prime gave me $20 off the final cost - and better yet - today I received and email from Intuit telling me they will refund me $25 once I file. They admitted they screwed up.  I think that is pretty honorable. Not too many companies I know would do that.
1,"Slowed my computer to a crawl. Kept is blocking important programs. I uninstalled it on my main work machine. I left it installed on the kid's computer, and my laptop.<br /><br />I am not sure what the answer is but they all are not great!"
2,Don't like how they re-tiered the software features this year (2014 tax year). Will consider an alternative (and probably less costly) product next year after using Intuit products for well over a decade.
2,"I have downloaded past upgrades, but for some reason this one didn't go well.  It wouldn't open and I had to do it again, then it opened, but there was a problem with the registration key.  I finally got it to work, but now I get emails from Norton saying that my security is expired, yet the program in my computer says I have nearly a year left.  Apparently the update and the old program don't talk to each other.  It now works fine, but it was more of a problem than it should have been."
4,"I paid over $600 last year to have someone do my taxes and didn't realize it would cost that much so I wanted to just try to see how hard it was to do my own taxes this year and not spend that again.  I was very surprised at how easy it was, I have an at home online business.  When I got to a section I didn't understand, I used the H&R Block chat feature which was quick and easy, and very helpful.  It took me a while of double checking and second guessing but I got it done and only had to pay the $35 for the program which wasn't bad at all.  Highly recommended for a first time user like myself.  Lots of help guides and very easy to understand for someone that thinks tax info is mumbo jumbo, lol."
4,This is the best antivirus that I have used since having a computer.  Easy to install and very easy to keep up to date and it does not slow down my system.  Thank you Avast.
2,"I am technically proficient so just a word of caution for those that may not be.  I keep my Vista very current using the Windows update site, but the Garmin downloader wanted to upgrade my old garmin downloader before proceeding, ok, so I download the offered upgrade, then it said that it needed a newer version of .NET, a middleware that Microsoft offers to make software developers life easier, if not ours.  The .NET download was large, and took a time to install on my admittedly old and slow laptop, maybe 15 minutes for download and install (7mgbit/sec DSL).  Then the Garmin updater kicked in for the install automatically, very little happens for 5 minutes, then \\""unexpected error message, try again, if another failure, call Garmin\\"".  So I tried again, same error message.  Then I did troubleshooting 101, rebooted, which btw was never suggested at any time, found the downloaded executable on my system, tried again, it works.  Map download proceeded with a couple of acceptance screens at the beginning, came back from 4 hours later, all done (may have finished earlier, I think it estimated about 2 hours).  Be sure to reboot after a .NET install, even though the system does not ask for one.  Garmin should really change their error message to reboot and retry before calling Garmin, it would save them and us a bunch of headaches."
3,My daughter enjoyed reading this. Anything dealing with that era intreges her. I'm so glad I can find books like this for her
3,Have had for several months now. It seems to be effective and fairly seamless. I would recommend it to friends as a good basic antivirus for most of their needs.
1,Worked adequately until printing failed to work.  Had to print one page at a time.  What a waste of time.
0,"started using quicken about a year ago.  took some effort getting set up but was starting to work pretty well.  unfortunatly over the course of the year the financial institutions that i have accounts with have moved, one by one, away from supporting \\""express web connect\\"".  Last january i was able to update most of my bank and credit card information directly from quicken with one step updates.  Now i'm down to one creditcard that will support this kind of update.  Others now support only manual downloads.  Or in the case of Citibank, they offer an \\""upgraded services\\"" for $10 per month in order to continue downloads.<br /><br />It appears that my options have become<br />a) manually download files from each financial institution<br />b) pay 100+ per year for each institution that offers \\""upgraded support\\"" (thanks \\""citi\\"" for that generous offer)<br />c) stop using quicken<br /><br />Bottom line is that without automatic downloads quicken is pretty useless to me."
4,"RollBack Rx PRO is the best restoration software for windows. I tried RestoreIt before, but Rollback RX is far much better. I really like the lock-in function of this app."
3,I've been using Avast Free antivirus now for a couple years and it has worked very well. It's comparable to many paid options I've tried. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solution to protect their computer.
0,Unable to get a complete download. Trying to cancel the order.Not sure if this is a software problem or my computer problem at this point.
4,I used this on all my pc&#34;s and friends pc's that I've rebuilt for them and never had an issue!<br /><br />Thanks!
4,was easy to follow. i have no complaints
0,"I was able to download data, but unable to accept it to registers. Also unable to manually add transaction.  This was my first time purchasing this software from amazon, and my last time........!"
2,"Good product. They should tell you about the \\""insurance tax\\"" that they tack on when you go to pay for the product."
4,"Like an earlier reviewer also mentioned, I have a MacBook Air without an optical drive, so I opted for a digital download.  It went over pretty smoothly. One note: after the download completes, you do not install Photoshop CS5 through Amazon.com's installer even though it may prompt you to do so (in which case there will be an error message). Instead, the download will create a file on your desktop containing Adobe's own installer, and you will open this folder and double-click the installer to complete your installation.<br /><br />My first laptop was a Dell Inspiron, a horrible machine that only lived two years, happily replaced by a black MacBook 13\\"" in 2006. A friend hooked me up with a bootleg copy of Photoshop CS1 (confession is good for the soul) and when my faithful MacBook gave up the ghost a couple of weeks ago, I discovered that its replacement, a MacBook Air 11\\"", would not run CS or CS2  because OS X Lion has discontinued support for applications based off the old PowerPC tech. Since I'm heading back to grad school (and need Photoshop) I decided to bite the bullet on a legit copy. Fortunately the price point on this digital copy was right.<br /><br />As far as features go, I'm still exploring everything, Bridge is new to me (as it wasn't included in CS1), but I can say CS5 is running much faster on the Air than CS1 did on the old MacBook.  But I just wanted to throw in my voice as someone who used the digital download with no problem. Just check your desktop for the folder with the installation tool, as the Amazon prompt at the end of download is not required once this application has finished downloading."
4,works great
2,"Norton Small Business seems like a bundle pack of Norton Internet Security with devices enrolled and managed from a web based interface. It's a good idea, but it seems like a repackaging of the retail product rather than the truly business oriented Endpoint Security.<br /><br />When I received the package it was a box much like pictured. It contained a plastic coated cardboard business card sized instruction card with the product key and a url: norton.com/subscribe. There was also a small one piece of glossy paper get started document that seemed more marketing than actual help. There was no CD - this is a download only product in a box of almost only empty space. That may not be a bad thing as with a high speed connection I downloaded and installed it on a windows 7 PC in about 10 minutes.<br /><br />When installed Norton Small Business it's pretty much Norton internet security. There is some central license control. Not all that much to describe beyond that. It has the usual browser plugins and malware protection as well as Outlook virus scanning and spam filtering.<br /><br />With additional devices one can login to the Norton account and download the product directly on the device or send an email invitation and have it installed from a link in the email. That's on PC's.<br /><br />I have a iPhone so I thought way-cool - now I have some malware protection available. But wait - there's less. When I emailed an invitation to my account and opened it on my iPhone and clicked the link it directed me to the iTunes app store and the Norton small business app. The app description showed screens with a locator and showing backups of contacts and other information. When I got it installed and activated (required my Norton account login) I ended up with a big friendly Norton icon on my iPhone.<br /><br />When I opened the Norton Small Business app on my iPhone all I got was a locator app. I was disappointed there was no real protection and it consumed one of the 10 seats for almost nothing in functionality! The locator can be activated from the Norton small business control panel. With this I was able to:<br /><br />1) locate my iPhone (it put it about a mile away from where I was sitting!?!?!)<br />2) call my phone (like I couldn't do that without the app?)<br />3) i could &#34;scream&#34; my phone. I could cause the iPhone speakers to sound an alarm sound, not an actual scream. If it was an actual recorded scream, that might be kind of cool or fun. Maybe it would be good for locating it but it did not seem to work with the iPhone on silent. Lame again.<br /><br />So, the locator could not locate my phone within a mile, it provided ways of doing things that I could do by calling the phone (get someone to answer and make a noise to find it between the sofa cushions. And it takes a whole seat from the 10 available. Unless you just have too many, don't bother.<br /><br />So with PC's it's a more or less centrally deployed and managed Norton Internet Security. On iPhone it's a waste of time. I don't have a Mac to install this on so can't really comment on what it is for Mac's.<br /><br />It will be a few days before I can try it on Android. I'll update this review when I find out what it has to offer there.<br /><br />One item of the hype is the no virus guarantee. As has been pointed out it's limited to Mac's and PC's and for Norton tech to try to remove the virus. If they decide they can, you can get a refund of the purchase price which may be prorated based on where you may be in your subscription. Not much of a guarantee, more marketing hype.<br /><br />Because of mobile and zero virus guarantee being more hype than real, and the PC version seems just a repackaging of the Internet Security retail product. It is basically a lackluster product that meets or falls short of expectations/hype I'm only giving it 3 stars.or almost nothing in functionality!

2,"This far exceeds the 2014 Turbo Tax. Major problem was that once I downloaded the Premium and Business software, I did not realize it was placed into two different spots. I struggled with the separate Business program, which offered a forms format with no coaching. Eventually I closed the window out of sheer frustration. At that point I realized there were two files. Once I opened the main H&R Premium, I breathed a sigh of relief! Why didn't they package them together? That is a huge error. Secondly, downloading my 2013 Turbo Tax files was crazy making. In one window, it wanted the the tax file format, and in another, the pdx format. This makes no sense, and needs to be fixed for 2015. After struggling for some time, I happened to match the right file with the correct window and viola! (The call center was no help with this issue). Once on the road, it was clear sailing. Their deduction calculator is much less friendly than It's Deductible, but that was a small price to pay for such superior service over Turbo Tax. I would buy this again, but be aware of the top two pitfalls listed above. Hope to be able to give this 5 stars next year."
0,"I've been using Quicken on my various Macs for 15+ years.  When I learned that Quicken 2007 was NOT going to run on the Lion OS, I was persuaded to buy Quicken Essentials.<br /><br />DON'T do it!  The original Quicken programs allow an excellent and comprehensive means of keeping track of personal finances.  I have some training in financial accounting, which helped me understand many of the features of Quicken, but it would have been equally useful to me without that training.  In short, the original Quicken program (and its updates through 2007) were fairly easy to set up and to use.  Ah, yes--at tax time (I've also been a long-time user of TurboTax), Quicken was simply delightful!  No pawing through cancelled checks or invoices--just press a button and TurboTax imports all the tax-relevant data from the year in question.  For the visual learner, the graphing function was another delight.  Want to see how your indebtedness or your net worth changes over time?  Quicken did it and more.  Special reports?  No problem!  \\""Quick reports\\""?  Yep!<br /><br />Well, those are just a few of the things that you will NOT find in the new and unimproved Quicken Essentials.  No more importing tax info into TurboTax.  No more breakdown of principle vs. interest in liability and loan accounts.<br /><br />I never have figured out why Intuit felt that \\""The Cloud\\"" displays were worth including.  Perhaps I've just never figured out how to read them.  Bring back the graphs!!!!!<br /><br />So I have kept my Quicken 2007, and have thus limited myself to pre-Lion Mac operating systems.  I periodically check out Essentials to see if any improvements have been made since its debut three years ago.  Nope.  I guess Intuit just doesn't think much of Mac users.  I can only pray they don't come out with some \\""essential\\"" version of TurboTax--or else I'll have to do my taxes on (eeww!) a Windows computer.<br /><br />Speaking of which, another Amazon review of Essentials gave me a dandy suggestion:get a program that allows Mac to run Windows apps and then use the 2012 or 2013 Windows version of Quicken (which is enough like the original Mac versions of Quicken to be both useful and usable).  But I resent having to do that!  If I wanted a Windows computer, with its Mac-inferior interface, I would not have been using Macs since 1984!"
3,HAS BEEN VERY EASY TO INCORPORATE FROM THE 2012 VERSION  NO PROBLEM WITH UPGRADING. OR USING AUTO UPDATE.  GREAT PRODUCT
0,"My new Windows 8.1 Dell does not acknowledge this product key as valid, and there is no option to get a refund on my money.  What a rip-off!"
0,The sorting time when entering as new transaction while reconciling takes forever.  I have been trying to reconcile my checking account for a few hours because I can't get the sort complete. It takes several minutes every time a new transaction is entered. In reconcile mode. Long time user of Quicken for all my financial data. I wish I had waited until later to upgrade.
4,"Item as described.  Download worked just fine. No problems.  I was a little worried, but downloaded very fast and I have not had any problems with the program or with my computer."
3,Does a vast majority of the things I wanted it to do. I got the newer version because it could do more of them.<br />4 stars instead of 5 because I had to upgrade my RAM to help it work well.
4,"It simply works!  It's always reassuring to hear the announcement (the program speaks) that Avast has updated itself.  I never have to think to update it, it's always on watch."
3,"I love the fact that there isn't a learning curve from an older version (2011) to 2014.  The options are the same.  In fact it appears most, if not all, of my favorite functions are still in the same place."
2,need  better defined info for recording tracks from  pc library
2,I like Quicken but with both the 2013 and 2014 versions I have problems with the application freezing up occasionally.  Very frustrating since you have to do the alt-control-delete thing and stop the program.  I would think that the Quicken application does too much nowadays to work properly sometimes.  I never had any problems with any previous versions before 2013.
3,Good.<br /><br />One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen
2,This is a old version.<br />You'll must pay more for upgrade. So why do you buy new version with good price?
1,"Did not like it. Stopped and purchased Turbo Tax, much better"
3,A license can not be used for an android device.
2,"I have actually worked with pro-level animation software that was actually not as complicated as Anime Studio. Otherwise, this isn't a bad piece of software to learn animation."
3,Working so far
2,It's exactly what it says it is.  If you need it you need it.  Really wish they would just allow PDF &#62; Word conversions for free though as well...
0,"Have been using the other guy (starts with H) for some years and it was okay. Somehow decided to try this one for a change, turned out to be a very poor decision.<br /><br />Issues:<br />1. Rather than popping boxes in my face and ask for everything I need to provide like H did, turbo tax decided to OMIT many of them until I tried hard to LOOK FOR those and fill the information. Had I not take a note on what H used to ask me, I could have missed a big chunk that I owe and I don't think IRS would be very happy about that.<br />2. One of the things OMITTED is stock sales. When I finally dug it out from the not that deep but very long menus, it failed to import ALL cost basis and purchase dates from TWO major brokers (starts with F and M, respectively) and I have to dig into F and M's system to hunt down ALL of them then manually type ALL of them, what's the point of importing if you can only import half of the info?<br />3. It is well known that turbo tax charges another $25 for 1 state efile (despite put the words 'free state included'  and + state in the title to try to make the unsuspected believe the other way around). HOWEVER that is not my problem here, my problem is that, after asking my name and address like 5 times in the previous process, it happily decided to ask for the 6th time rather than provide an option of &#34;use this one&#34; when trying to charge me this $25. One might wonder why doesn't it ask for your address and social security number every time when you fill any single box in the program?<br /><br />Going back to H next year for sure."
2,"Work fine with IE8.1 but still can't get the toolbar to show in Chrome.  This issue is bulls***.  I jumped through all their hoops and Chrome's trying to get it to work and it won't show.  That is a real pain in the ass because with all the damn logins I use I need this damn thing in Chrome.    I liked Norton Internet Security better...not much of an improvement over the last couple years with this.  Still worth the money when they offer the deal offered by Amazon one day, still don't get it when you try to just renew what you have it is twice the cost of getting the five copies (I paid $31 for the 5).  The protection does work and it saves your passwords so until I find something with a better price than the once or twice a year one I get on Amazon I will keep using it."
4,Easy download & working fine!  Nothin' like Excel!
0,Rip off!  Key code is not valid. Spent 3 hours on phone with Amazon and Norton who confirmed Key code is not valid!  Done with Norton.  Will use another system.
0,"This program did not find the viruses that were for sure in my computer, and the popups were VERY frequent and frustratingly pointless. Only used free trial, but I would never pay for this horrible product. Stick with the big names at least they will not waste your money."
1,"I really expected more out of this product, but it just keeps crashing, constantly, and not just every day, but several times every day.  Plus, I keep getting a pop-up asking me to install some special toolbar to make surfing safe.  Why would I do that when it can't even keep from crashing?  Plus, every time I've installed a toolbar, it always comes with some sort of negative side effects, so...no.  It does let you know if anything looks dangerous, so I do like that feature, and it is easy to install.  I would actually give this product a 2.5 instead of just a plain old 2 rating, but it just doesn't quite meet my expectations of even 3 stars, so I have to give it a plain old 2."
1,I download this software for my new IMAc and the software started to have issues. I tried to look up any updates for the new IOS7 and nothing yet.  You will need to do your studying up on this software to figure out how exactly it works.
1,"Not very impressed with this.  If you are looking for organization, slideshow, greeting cards, etc then this is going to be good for you.  The edit and enhancement options are pretty limited, and that's what I was looking for."
3,Best tax software.  I use it year after year.  Intuit has gotten too expensive.
0,"Horrible version. I consider myself an advance pc user but there is no way to install this program. Even worse, there is not easy return if you run into trouble like I did."
4,I found that the typing instructor was easy and fun to use.  It helped me improve my typing speed an !!
1,"I was forced to upgrade from Quicken 2010 because the online service was going to come to an end. Compared to 2010, product usability seems better. The item category taxonomy is improved. There are quite a few other details that I noticed being improved as I was trying to set it up. But for me personally, the product has limited utility. Why? They have dropped the online update support for the bank with my brokerage account in Quicken 2013. It is one of the major banks too. I have reported the problem a couple of times to Quicken support. I got very polite responses back, but that did not help me get back to being able to use the product.<br /><br />Bottom line: Without the online update facility, Quicken 2013 Deluxe is no longer the one place I can track my finances easily. If they do not add support for the bank in another month or so, I will have to look for an alternative after about 10 years of using Quicken."
1,download continually fails
1,NOT at all what I was looking for and it wouldn't load to my computer for whatever reason.  Wasted my Money and way too busy to get on the phone and sit with someone to fix the problem.  I would recommend getting it the old fashion way.  Wait for the CD to show up and then load it.  The download didn't work for me.  And before you ask...Windows 7
0,WHY IN THE HELL IS THIS EVEN FOR SELL ITS LAST YEARS!!!!!!
3,"best part of turbo tax is that your information rolls over every year.........be careful, those questions aren't gonna catch all your issues....but if you have a W-2 and maybe a SCH A, this will do"
1,"This is a review for an online version of TurboTax Premiere.<br /><br />First, I want to say that I was using TurboTax products for past 3 years and quality is decreasing.<br /><br />If you have a simple return TurboTax is perfect, but as soon as you have more complicated case things get tricky.<br /><br />In my case, TurboTax did not calculate Disqualified Disposition for the stock sold previously bought via employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). It did not even ask me about whether sold stock were purchased.<br /><br />As a result, I had to re-calculate everything in Excel, than modify in TurboTax and then file an amendment. Hassle!<br /><br />I would have given 4 stars had TurboTax had everything related to stock automated, 3 stars if it would at least asked about special tax situation after selling ESPP stock.<br /><br />As is, it is a calculation sheet you can download for free from IRS but automated.<br /><br />Yes, it does save time but you need to double-check everything."
3,"Despite all of the negative reviews, I'm setting up my finances outside of Excel for for the first time. Comparing other software like iBank and Moneydance, I found Quicken to be very reasonably priced (purchased on sale, similar in price to the Amazon price at the time of this review), and included features that iBank wanted to charge a monthly subscription for (downloads from Financial Institutions, mainly).<br /><br />I don't have any stocks or money market accounts to track. I just want to track where my money goes, know when bills need to be paid, pay off some debt, and project my future cash flows. Quicken does brilliantly compared to the competition. If I had purchased at full price, I don't know if I'd feel the same way. The software does what it's supposed to do, if you consider it independent of its Windows counterpart (which also comes in many different editions).<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm pleased with it, and would recommend it for &#34;average Joes&#34; like myself, not for those with tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in advanced investments."
4,"I gave Turbotax a 5, because I have used it without any problems for the last five years.  Once again, the software download installed without  issue.  Turbotax automatically locates last year's return and pre-fills many of the blanks.  The software is accurate and reliable, much better than the company's other offering, Qucken, which is crap.  It's hard to believe that the same company makes both products."
1,This product hasn't changed in at least 10 years.  Not worth buying a new version when you don't get any new functionality.  It looks like it was designed for Windows 95.
1,The downloadable file on Amazon is corrupt so I had to go to the maker's site to download the program.  Very long process and I had to enter all my info again in the other site to get the trial download!
4,"I have used TurboTax since it first came out years ago. It is a fantastic software that makes you an instant tax accounting genius. It has never failed me throughout my life as I have moved from employee to business owner, then into rental property, then selling a business, and so on. It is great!"
1,During a year of Quicken 2013 I suffered through a of transactions landing in an [Unspecified Account].  I bought 2014 believing Intuit that 2014 would be an improvement over 2013.  Absolutely no improvement!  I wish that Google would move into the personal finance arena so that Inuit would be forced to improve the quality of their products and to innovate.<br /><br />I am disappointed I still cannot see my investment accounts in the mobile version of Quicken like I can in the mobile version of Mint!?  Bottom-line:  Quicken 2014 is not a good product and a terrible customer experience.
2,"Where is the cancel print option?  A print dialogue box no longer pops up when printing.  Also, don't like that that Publisher is no longer an option and must be purchased separately.  Was on the older version that I was using."
3,"i have the free download, but for what it is, it's amazing. I'm sure if i bought the big one it will be the five star package. Avast keeps my computer running well, and that is the best thing you can hope for."
2,"Easy to use, but all the self-prepatory software programs are pretty easy these days.<br /><br />I find the software to be on the expensive side, slightly, compared with others but I am very upset at the expense of $30 to have my refund check deposited into my checking account - for my federal refund and an additional $20 for the state refund to be deposited into my account.<br /><br />That means that I spent over $50 for the purchase of the software disc, plus another $50 for automatic deposits for my refunds.  Too much money.<br /><br />Lastly, I tried submitting my state refund and because of a computer glitch or some other lame excuse for international scamming, I was sent an email apologizing for the inconvenience and was offered a $25 rebate on my TurboTax purchase.  I found this to be an absolute joke as I entered my info and ID number of my product and was informed that my purchase wasn't eligible for the rebate/payment for inconvenience.  What a friggin' joke.<br /><br />This has PO'd me to the point that this will be my last Intuit purchase and I will not recommend your products to anyone from this point forward.<br /><br />BTW - I have used TurboTax for probably 20 years now and as I said - NO MORE."
0,"Quicken did not work for me, support was not helpful at all. Have contacted them and still were not able to resolve the issue. Tried to get a refund and have not been able to do so. Don't get unless you get some support."
1,"I used 2012 version. That is why I purchased 2013 again. But this time , I am not lucky. After installation, the main screen display nothing, no activation screen poped up. Finally, I installed it on a XP (vmare). Sigh..."
4,This was the download version and was able to input the license key into the free version 2.0 and didn't have to do the full install to get this validated. Highly recommended.
0,"This is crap. Don't buy the download, because then you'll be screwed for a return like I am. Hate this program"
0,"Turbo tax advertised this product had state and federal e-filing but when I went to file my client's return, the program demanded $65 extra in filing and software costs to do an e-filing for the state."
0,"I am so sorry I didn't order the disc!  I downloaded from amazon.com and this software took my computer to places I never wanted it to go!  It screwed up my computer so badly that I had to remove it and take my computer to back to an earlier period before it would function without all those error messages, etc..  Do not buy this product!"
3,Could not do without Snagit
2,It does what it's supposed to do but I still think it's a lot of money for the product in general. Nice that you save some buying it here though.
3,Fine
2,It's a Microsoft product.
1,"Not a good program, does not offer alot of help. Too confusing. I am sorry i bought it. Wasted money"
0,"NOT HAPPY: After the \\""one step\\"" upgrade to and purchase of Deluxe 2014, the program would not synchronize with my bank. The customer support operator quickly \\""found the problem\\"" and would correct it for $199.99. On my objection he quickly discounted the fee to $149.99. After further discussion he dropped the fee further to $99.99. I JUST BOUGHT THE SOFTWARE and hadn't even synched to my bank. I feel this is a BS ploy to pull more money out of my pocket. I HADN'T EVEN USED IT YET! One more lost customer. I'm torqued!!"
1,"Outright dismissal GUI / Font scaling.  Controls and text artifacting all over the interface.  Some enormous text in the register...account list text is tiny.  Fooled with my settings for an hour can get text either extremely too large, unreadably small or an inexplicable mixture of both.  Unusable."
4,All people living in the US and it Territories needs to read the Constitution to gain an understanding of the governments rights and responsibilities.
3,"The best feature of the software is that it imports information from Merrill Lynch brokerage account which saves a lot of time vs inputting the information myself.  One thing that puzzles me: I did my taxes, saved and printed, but didn't send.  A few weeks later I went back in to send and the state tax owed was $9 more than what I printed.  It had to do with tax-free investment, but I am puzzled how it changed itself."
1,Can't get answers from a live representative.  On line answers are always to problems that I don't have.  Wouldn't buy it again because of this.
3,"This turbotax was easy to use.  I thought I might have some difficulty, but I was able to finish without additional problems."
3,Reliable as always.  Easy to use. Doesn't deserve the bad rap others have given it.
1,"Advertised price: Federal $0, State $0.<br />Then I did my taxes.<br />New price: Federal $35, State $25, bank fee to pay for it with part of my refund $35. Actual price, $95.<br />Be honest, don't hide the costs.<br />I got a discount on the federal, did my state using the state's website, and payed with a credit card.<br />Final cost: $25.<br />I don't mind paying for a product that makes my life easier. I don't like all the bs hidden costs and advertising about free this and that.<br />I have pretty simple returns, if I didn't get it free, hardly anyone will."
1,"I was FORCED to upgrade to continue electronic access to most of my accounts.  Some work, some do not work and Intuit/Quicken provides zero (or horrible) user support.  The next time I need to update/upgrade my basic accounting software, I'll look elsewhere.  If not stuck with this one for now, I'd return it and raise hell.  Sure, it still does the basics that Quicken is famous for, but the promised interfaces with banking institutions and others are clunky as best, all require some special arrangement and even then the results are not reliable.  For manual use and simple basics, perhaps OK; for the promised interactive features - Not Even Close."
4,It is a must to have a beneficial virus fighter and fixer like Norton. Norton has improved over the years and it is of great value to me.
3,OK
4,"Credit Monitoring is nice. CAUTION: make sure that everything you type in when initially signing on to the credit monitoring is correct. Equifax may lock you out for days thinking you are a fraud. In my case, Equifax the company they partner with, had a bad address on me. I was answering correctly in my mind but they thought otherwise because of this bad address. I suggest you get your once a year free report from Equifax and make sure all the info they have is correct before you log on Quicken and go to Reports&#62;Credit Score&#62;Credit Report Summary the first initial time. There is nothing Quicken can do in this case, it's all between you and Equifax. And if you do not have a paid account with Equifax they do not want to deal with you. If you get the free report from them you have a reference number that helps. But digressing, the Deluxe 2015 is just fine. &#34;:-Dx"
1,"had to reinstall several times, categories incredibly slow to load customer service is available but they don't always know how to fix the problem other than offering to sell me the 2013 edition.. I had to create a whole new set of files."
3,I bought this software to use with my GoPro 3+. Works very well. Inexpensive.  Still trying to learn to use it. A+ for my use. Highly recommend.
1,"Not near as versatile as in past. I had one Sch C item for less than 100.00, no expenses and could not access Sch C without upgrading."
3,"I purchased this map software download to keep my Nuvi 350 up to date. I upgraded, for free, my operating software for the Nuvi 350 and had the latest Garmin download software installed on my computer. When I followed the link on Amazon's web page to download the map software I would only recieve an error message from Garmin stating their system was unable to process the download. Previous online experience with Garmin has been good. I would not recommend purchasing this software from Amazon at this time. Initial response to this offer overloaded the Garmin site. Came home from work the next day and everything worked with the download site. I have a newly updated GPS for $30. Sweet!"
4,The product seamlessly brings in last years info - I was done in half an hour including E-file.  I will use this annually.
2,Great price for a good product but it was hard to download because of having used a different product the previous year. We went on customer support and they helped us with it and all was good!
0,There was a problem with my computer and I couldn't install the program. I call Amazon to take it off of my bill....... They said  there is nothing they can do! I have to pay for it and I can't use it! Never download a program off Amazon again
3,"No fault with the product itself, but found it difficult to install on new computer running Windows 8. However, the Norton help center did an excellent job of installing it for me."
1,"I have happily used the Windows version of Quicken for over 15 years.  Recently, I switched to a Mac and decided to give Quicken for Mac 2015 a try.  What a mistake.  This version is a poor substitute for the Windows version.  Many of the features that have been in the Windows version for some time are missing in this version.  Unless you need a only a very basic checkbook function, run the Windows version under a Windows partition instead of buying this one."
0,"I had purchased a disc of Turbo Tax Personal early in the year. While doing my taxes, close to the deadline, Turbo Tax Personal told me I needed Turbo Tax Personal and Small Business to complete my taxes. I could not locate a disc form of Turbo Tax Personal and Business locally so I purchased and downloaded it from Amazon in April. It was supposed to transfer my existing information from Turbo Tax Personal to Turbo Tax Personal and Business but I ended up with a letter from my state revenue office asking about entries I had submitted.<br /> I triple check all form entries before I print my forms for myself and 'snail-mail' my forms to the state and federal because honestly, I do not trust E-file, at all. The only think I can figure out is Turbo Tax Personal and Small Business did not load the information from Turbo Tax Personal correctly. It's all been very frustrating with Turbo Tax this year. I'm really wondering if I'll purchase it again or go with another provider. I'll decide that later."
3,It gets the job done:-):-):-):-)
2,"usual quickbooks, works ok, lots of bugs, but we dont have a lot of options."
0,"Okay... I have been buying TurboTax software for a few years now. They ALWAYS included 1 free copy of state version. With this package you are look at this page, it DOES NOT include 1 free copy of the state version. You will have to pay an additional $39.99 for just 1 state.<br /><br />Now I am out $35 buy buying this product as I will have to repurchase the one with the state (listed as $44.99 Prime price). Why in the world would you have 1 product priced at $34.99 while there is a better product at $44.99. People really do not want to spend the extra $10????!!!"
3,It serves it's purpose. To expensive.
2,"-antivirus slows up the system. there are other free better anti virus out there, this just isn't the one."
4,I love the radial filter and the new lens correction features.  Those features alone are worth the price to me.
4,Great program
1,"I was forced to upgrade to Quicken Premier 2013 from Quicken Premier 2010 so as to dounload current stock prices. I have used Quicken for many years. The transaction page for entries to an investment account is too wide for my Monitor now,so I can't see the date and the dollar amount at the same time as I did wih 2010.  When making an error in entering a check in the check register I can not just hit a simple delete button. The error stays stuck even if I backspace it out.  Entering split categories for a check written much more a hassle than in QP2010. It is too difficult to find total income for a particular stock for the year. I upgraded to the Premier years ago specifically because it was to handle investments.  The check register gets all sorts of minute detail for categorized expenditures but go to a Brokerage account and interest income, dividend income and deferred income totals are nowhere to be found. Entering deferred income amounts is very awkward as these are not in the drop down list categorizing transactions so I put them as Misc. then go to the All category list and find Deferred Income there. Very irritating and time consuming Auto fill doesn't kick in. Entries in the check register no longer will quickly give me the detail for a specific payee as it did in QP2010. I had a promotion discount but was billed Maximum amount. Comparison of Income and Expenses doesn't include Brokerage income and interest in the report,OUCH !"
1,"I was disappointed that this program didn't handle adoption (tax free expense reimbursements from employers) correctly.  It took an hour and a half with customer service to confirm that it just wasn't possible.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that I clicked on the on-line version for $23.99, but when it came time to finalize the return, the only charge option was $39.95.  The pricing didn't follow through, and it felt a little deceptive."
4,Great
1,"Only reason I purchased Quicken 2013 is to be able to use the mobile app. I thought it may be useful when traveling.  As it turns out my bank has updated its mobile app so it was not necessary to use this app.  The other reason I purchased it was that Intuit will not support downloading banking information if you are using a 2010 version of its program.  Other than that there is little new in this version and it continues to present a problem when downloading banking information.  I find that it at times confuses income and expenses and categorizes incorrectly.  Recently, I had expenses categorized as a baby gift to my friends daughter. I am generous but I do not think I send a gift a dozen times a month.  They categorized donations, ATM withdrawals, EFT transactions, etc., as gifts.  I have to go through each one and now compare them to my banking statements to correct these errors (the bank has them correctly listed).  It made creating spending and income reports difficult. It also takes time to load, particularly when it has to update files, and I have a relatively new desktop with an excessive amount of memory. I do not know if others have experienced these problems but for these reasons I gave it two stars."
2,"Downloaded and installed this from Amazon. Works fine and cheaper than the boxed version. The improvements over the previous version (2010?) are minor. The MAIN reason to upgrade is that Intuit discontinues support for downloading data directly from the Banks to FORCE you to upgrade. This stinks! I really wish they had some decent competition. Come on entrepreneurs, take these guys on,-its about time."
1,"this is mainly for making videos to share or upload, and not for burning onto a DVD or such.  Had issues with installing, thinking it needs a lot of systems resources to work. but in the end, just a video editor to upload to youtube or share to a cell phone.  Sony should be embarrassed to mislead customer to think this is a true full video editor."
2,"Had to get on line help to get Outlook to work.  Disappointed that Calendar, etc., won't sync with Google. Like interface, and used to working with this product, but MS makes changes w/o other considerations."
0,"The software is buggy, and customer support is worse than non-existent. It will not file, I don't know why, it just won't. I follow the links for their so-called customer service, all I get is sent around in a circle with offers to buy their software. Several times I was stopped dead due to non-nonsensical errors that it would not let me correct."
2,I love this program but I hate to having to upgrade a product just so I can connect to my bank.  If I could find a free application with basic balance your check book I would switch the minute they asked for any more money.  Mabye my bank will offer a free service in the future.
4,EXCELLENT PROTECTION!
1,"Kids were a little scared of some of the sound effects and pics. LOL! I liked it though, but they won't play it much."
1,"First of all, if you are still using Windows XP or Vista you need not apply. MS Office 2013 and its component parts are not compatible with Windows XP or Vista. Windows 7 or Windows 8 are required for you to install this program.<br /><br />While MS Publisher does have its quirks and limitations, I have used the 2010 version successfully for a couple of years to publish four-color newsletters and bulletins. It generally has a less steep learning curve than some other programs such as [[ASIN:B006PJIETE Serif PagePlus]], and you can be up and running in a reasonably short time.<br /><br />One of the advantages of Publisher was that it allowed you to print as a composite CMYK document which could then be sent to a print shop for four-color printing.<br /><br />With version 2013 this feature has been removed and printing houses can no longer use a direct MS Publisher file for printing. There seems to be no workaround for this problem.<br /><br />In addition to removing this feature and the HTML feature another reviewer commented on, the program is more of a pain to use than before. Just like other Microsoft \\""improvements\\"" this program requires more steps to do everything than in previous editions. They have also failed to fix previous shortcomings, such as the ability to create keyboard macros.<br /><br />All in all, \\""new and improved\\"" is neither with this product. If you have an older version of Publisher that continues to work with whatever operating system you are using I encourage you to continue using it. If you have to upgrade, find a copy of Publisher 2010 (which is compatible with Windows 8) and leave this dog in the doghouse."
4,"This course has been great.  Challenging and fun; but most of all, extremely helpful."
0,"I have used Q 13 for a year and recently am having a download problem with Vanguard - they are working on it, but  maybe they need some help.  Hoping that Q 14 would fix the problem I bought it and loaded it.  It did NOT fix the Vanguard problem and refused to talk with BB&T.  I contacted them and they said it would be late November when Q 14 would work.  I took down Q 14 and went back to Q 13.<br /><br />So my result is that I switched too early or Quicken didn't have its ducks in a row and still released it.  Since I will eventually use it I have not returned it but have not used it either.<br /><br />Vernon Mountcastle"
0,"Horrible experience as a new customer...They allowed me $25k in credit card processing, i had a client pay me using his business credit card for $16k which was verified and fully legit. Intuit merchant services waited till the 5th business day to call me and say &#34;we are holding these funds&#34; they refused to release the funds without jumping through all their crap. I reported this to the CEO Brad Smith using Linked In along with how we were treated.<br /><br />I called my bank who will handle my merchant services from now on. My bank has approved a $50k credit process daily and told me that all credit charges will post in 2 days so I'm going to stick with my bank from now on.<br /><br />I issued a full credit reverse back to my clients credit card on 1/10 @ 1151am and today 1/16 1pm i was told it will take an additional 5 business days to credit my client since they were so dumb they didn't consider touching my credit process until i called them to inquire. This company is SO AZZ BACKWARDS!<br /><br />Businesses would do better using merchant services with your bank instead of this company!"
1,This is a very complicated piece of software... it is definitely not meant for a person like me.  And it is very expensive.
4,This was easy to do. We didn't feel like spending the money to go to the tax guy again like we did the first year we got married and had to do our taxes ourselves (parents doing it was sooo much easier haha). But this was perfect and simple. I would suggest going ONCE to an accountant (especially if you do freelance stuff like I do) and then start using Turbo Tax because it's so simple and cheaper.
0,"Despite the bad reviews and my dad telling me first-hand the issues he was having, I went ahead and purchased TurboTax again because it just seemed easier to continue using. Definitely a mistake. It is a mess this year. Not even sure where to start. Believe the reviews."
1,"Professional IT and computer engineer here. I like Office 2010. 2013 is basically 2010 plus an extra layer on top of the interface to conform to the Windows 8 model of &#34;simplicity&#34; and touch screens. The problem is that Microsoft is &#34;doing it again&#34; like they have over the years. Just because they /can/ add an extra layer of interface doesn't mean they should. It just confuses the experienced user and does nothing for the new user. For example, open a Word form that worked easily in Word 2010, and you are presented with a situation where it is not clear what to do to actually fill in the form. You have to hit &#34;Edit&#34; or something to actually get into a mode where the form will fill. It used to work &#34;automatically&#34; before.<br /><br />Back in the day of Word 95 and 2000 and 2003, Microsoft added buttons and toolbars and all kinds of ways to interact with the program. There were 100+ buttons for the user to choose from on the screen. Then they made a breakthrough with the ribbon and put all the functionality in one place instead of four or five places. Now they are swinging the pendulum too far the other way and trying to go minimalist. For a desktop computer, that is not what we need. And furthermore, when I install this product on an office computer, I need the non-techie users to be able to use it immediately without having to figure out how to get the new &#34;minimalist&#34; interface out of the way so they can actually do something.<br /><br />OK, so it functions. Not great, but it functions. What I wish is that MS would stop trying to make a product that works the same on a desktop, laptop, tablet, and smartphone. Different platforms with different screen sizes and different expectations require a tweak to the interface."
0,"The spell check in Word does not work properly. All my settings are set for English,  just do spell check for a portion of the work.  It's frustrating!"
3,"Recently purchased this product, easy user interface and a great program, works well and smoothly - will be back to buy more Movavi products."
0,"I am really disappointed by this product. I had gone to a couple of review sites which gave it very high marks, and said it was the most user friendly of 5 top-rated products of this type. Unfortunately, I did not find it at all user friendly. Whether going to the &#34;help&#34; button, or printing off and high-lighting sections, I still couldn't figure out some of the basics.  For the rank amateur, this is NOT the right product. I finally gave up and tried something else."
3,"Been using this product for years now.  Works great.<br /><br />This is the first time I have used a state version too, in my case, Arizona.  The state program is not as sophisticated.  Imagine reentering all the identifying info a second time, without even the option to copy the data from the federal data in the same file.  And the screens and Help are not as complete as the Fed version."
4,"easy to use,  saves time,  provides security that taxes down correctly"
1,not meet what iexpect.
0,"I've used Quicken for over 12 years now.  I don't need all its complexity, but it did the job I wanted.<br /><br />I had to upgrade from 2011 t0 2014.  I downloaded my upgrade from Quicken.  THE DAMN THING WON'T INSTALL!!  The computer just hangs up 95% of the way through the process.<br /><br />I've tried all the help available through Quicken's site, and nothing works.  A lot of it is written for people well above my paygrade in computer savvy.<br /><br />Telephone help or chat is unavailable (&#34;please call after 8 pm Pacific time&#34;  I'm in bed by then.)<br /><br />I've needed telephone or chat in dealing with issues before.  If this is the way the program is supported--I'm out of here.<br /><br />BEFORE YOU BUY OR UPGRADE--BE SURE YOU PRINT OUT THE DATA YOU WANT.  REMEMBER THAT THE FIRST STEP OF AN UPGRADE IS TO WIPE OUT YOUR OLD PROGRAM, SO YOU CAN'T ACCESS ANY OF YOUR CAREFULLY BACKED UP DATA!!!<br /><br />Yes I'm disgusted."
3,It's a very convenient way to do an annual exercise we all hate doing.  I like the e-file feature the most.
2,I've had a lot of problems with outlook as far as syncing and email verification. I feel that the other programs work phenomenally however outlook is lacking in some major ways
0,Program interface is poor.<br />Major windows clipping problems.<br />Unable to repair JPG with damaged header.<br />Would not recommend.<br />All blow and no show.
2,"Turbo Tax is easy to use for the most part.  I used the deluxe version because it offers a free state download and checks for errors in both.  Unfortunately the state accepted my return and promptly put it in the audit file.  Now the expected date for my return has be moved out to June 14, 2015.  Turbo tax stated the we where a low risk for an audit, but so much for that.  Might use something else next year, not real happy right now."
4,Best price and very easy to do. Good experience and I will be able to find my software any time I need it.
0,"When you go to enter investments, a screen prompts you to upgrade to Premier for $9.99. When you go to make the purchase the amount is $30. When I contacted Customer Support, they stated &#34;we're sorry about that but there's nothing we can do. Would you like to upgrade now?&#34; Time to move on to another product that doesn't gouge you for having investments, especially one that doesn't pull a bait and switch within the software. I have used TurboTax for years but won't stand for this level of gouging and bait and switch built into the product."
0,"Totally useless to me. I thought it did cd labels, but obviously it  doesn't. A waste of my time and money."
3,Avast does a very good job of protecting my computer with a relatively small footprint and low memory and cpu usaage.
2,"I originally purchased Tax Act to replace Turbo Tax Deluxe.  But after seeing some &#34;red flags&#34; and software issues, I decided not to use Tax Act but only as a &#34;double checker/reference tool&#34;.<br /><br />1)  IMPORT FROM TURBO TAX PDF - MALFUNCTION<br /><br />2)  UPDATE BUTTON - MALFUNCTION - You can manually update.<br /><br />3)  UNCLEAR INSTRUCTION - As I am filling out the W-2 info for boxes 18-20, I  realize I cannot do anything with Box 20.  Box 20 is a drop down menu but there is no option for &#34;CA-SDI&#34;.  Instead I get a prompt to delete the info for boxes 18-20 and put in the SDI number in box 14.  How do I know removing info is okay and will not impact the return?<br /><br />4)  CONSUMER AFFAIRS COMPLAINTS -  While all three major tax software had complaints (Turbo Tax, H & R Block, TaxAct), the complaints for TaxAct were &#34;interesting&#34;.  It made me think twice whether the savings was even worth the possible headaches.  Past TaxAct users complained to the Consumer Affairs about IRS fines for not receiving the tax payments on time or for refunds going into the wrong account.<br /><br />Source:  http://www.consumeraffairs.com/finance/taxactonline.html"
0,"Hate it.<br />Water Mark on printed state return saying &#34;form not complete&#34;, &#34;do not file&#34; when in fact it is complete."
2,"I really love this program, but wasn't sent a serial number with my order when I ordered a digital download. I only received the activation code. I had this refunded. I'm going to purchase through Corel directly."
1,"Update: I finally uninstalled Norton. What a pain! This runs constantly and slows my system waaaayyyy down. Even when I ask it to stop it doesn't. I went with AVG, am trying it for 30 days. So far, much better. Norton was a waste of money, at least for Vista.<br /><br />Norton was easy to download, seems to be working well with Windows 7 and XP, but not with Vista. But then, Vista is a pain in the rear in general. My computer wants to shut down frequently when I have a lot of things open. Maybe it's just the computer, but it's happened more since I installed Norton."
3,So good so far. It was hard to download on my laptop because it needed the amazon installer. But i downloaded it on my regular XP and it transferred my TurboTax info from last year. I haven't finished doing my taxes yet so I'll have to see.
2,I choose this over a free program because I didn't want to manually enter transactions but O wound up doing it anyway.
3,I got this guide for my mother and it has helped her learn the program very well. I would recommend it with the program to anyone that is looking for a good quality photo editing program that are not used to using photoshop.
1,Better look twice before down loading this item. They did tell me my saved data could not be downloaded to this edition. I have<br />to update to a more expensive edition. I have never had so much trouble getting a program to run. Think twice.
1,A problem with a form (8960 I believe) apparently would have forced me to redo my entire return after having already done it. I think I filled it out correctly. That's not why I bought tax software. No way to contact Intuit directly.
0,"Sorry, I'm not a &#34;Verified Purchaser&#34; this year either.  Intuit went over the top with this years Turbo Tax pricing.  In fact my distrust started last year when my &#34;Quicken&#34; expired and I was forced to purchase it again in order to download transactions from my bank.<br /><br />I was convinced to go with H&R Block tax software one day when it was the Deal of the Day on Amazon.  I'm sure I can handle the learning curve for the price difference between Intuit.  If all goes well, H&R Block will become my yearly friend."
3,It has help me a lot in my web browsing on the net and other things.<br />I recommend it to everybody who is using the net.
0,do not installe this it causes you computer to become infectied
1,"I have been using Turbo Tax for over 25 years. (used Turbo Tax when Parsons before Intuit owed it) Turbo Tax 2014 is the worst!!! I use Turbo Tax to file taxes for family and friends. Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014 has omitted some crucial forms from their program, trying to force you to purchase their more expensive versions. When I print out the taxes to file, it omits the form whith the address of where to file. One thing over the years that I never understood is when I print out a return, it always print out extra supporting form that you don't need. (Paper reduction act)."
4,The best! Couldn't be easier to use and watch how you spend. I have tracked our spending money for years and this is the first time with Quicken - so much better and it makes it very easy to budget and see where your money goes!
0,"I have had Quicken for many years and have about given up on it. I was a beta tester and it was people like me that MADE the program. I haven't wanted to upgrade because SO MANY features and USER control was taken away (such as my old files I categorized [schedule F] myself and had farming as a business) that LAST update they no longer recognized farming as a business and all business reports were NON-EXISTENT.<br /><br />I wrote two letters to the CEO and commented how lousy their support was getting and how they no longer LISTENED to the customer.<br /><br />Now I am FORCED to upgrade to a program I do NOT want! Read reviews of 2011, 2012, 2013 and EVERY year gets worse with reporting and user control. I WOULD PAY for the download privilege but IF they SHUT that off I will AGAIN look for another program that will be as useful as Quicken ONCE was.<br /><br />Either they are ONLY after the money or they have idiot customers that can't think HOW to run a \\""good\\"" accounting program. It will really make me mad if I lose 15+ years of data,' address's, etc. all set up well because of Quickens STUPIDITY and how NON responsive and useless Quicken has become."
4,"Really easy to use and got it for a great price.  I like that it imports last years info and also the info from E*Trade.  Don't waste your money and pay someone to do it, pay $20 and get this."
3,"Had a little problem with rolling over an IRA.  On the screen it looked like a problem, but when looking at the forms it was not.  A tech had to help."
3,Good product.  I purchase this product every year.  I will continue to purchase this product and get the digital download version.
3,I renewed the NIS via Amazon rather than the Norton site because of the significant price difference.  I've use Norton for the past five to ten years and have not experienced any &#34;hacker-related&#34; issues with it.  I believe it's a good product.
1,"Not easy to use.  I am a designer who has to work fast, I'm still getting used to the interface on this.  I don't think it's as powerful as Photoshop, but, for the price you can't beat it.  I've actually used it only once or twice since it takes much MUCH longer to get publications completed with this program."
3,No problems with it working.  I agree that price change and determining correct version for your needs is lacking.
3,"It works, I have used turbotax for more than 10 years and don't know of any tax software easier to use."
3,"Easy to navigate, good help screens, overall a great product. I have used TurboTax since the MS-DOS, DeskMate and Windows versions...<br /><br />TOO BAD INTUIT RUINED QUICKEN FOR MAC USERS!!!"
3,Very easy to use. Great interface & design. Mobile app functionality is limited.
1,Wish it was easier to use.  The budget tool doesn't balance correctly without endless corrections.  The link to online accounts feature doesn't update often enough and it pops up every time I boot my computer.  Going back to an excel spreadsheet.
3,"I was reluctant to buy this after all of the negative reviews, but I didn't have much of a choice as I need some sort of software to manage both home and business expenses. So far, I haven't had any of the bad experiences that others have mentioned. I think it may come down to how you install this on your machine.  Here are my recommendations if you're upgrading from an old version:  1. Make a backup copy of your Quicken data file -- one that you'll use for the 2012 software and another copy for safe keeping.  2. Uninstall the old version of the software.  I think this step is key. Whenever you \\""upgrade\\"" to a new version of software, it's rare that you *need* the old version to be on your computer. I've learned time again from both financial software and internet security software that it's almost always better to uninstall the old version first.  3. Reboot your computer.  4. Install the new software. I bought mine directly from Intuit to ensure it would be more up-to-date (though it was more expensive than purchasing here).  Once you start Quicken, it will ask if you want to open an existing Quicken file. Then you can point it to your backup file.  I hope this helps someone.  By the way, I'm only giving this 4 stars because there are some aspects of Quicken that I just don't like. It just doesn't function as smoothly as MS Money did, but I haven't found any other alternatives that I like better, especially for tracking freelancing work."
4,As stated.  Easy to install - just make sure this is the one you want.  It does not have a firewall function.  That would be AVG internet security.
2,I used the software to prepare a pro forma return in order to estimate both state and local taxes. It got the job done but I found it more cumbersome to use than turbo. Ease of retrieving and inputing date inconsistent although eventually got the job done.
2,"If you're going to do your own taxes, TurboTax makes it pretty easy. I'm still annoyed they don't import quickbooks online directly even though they're by the same company."
1,"I find the newer version harder to use., slower, fewer &#34;use examples,&#34; and the the drag and drop function useless fpr me personally. I don't think the &#34;headword&#34; and &#34;definition&#34; separation function useless to me personally."
3,"I've been using Quicken 2015 Rental Property Manager for about a month now and as the title indicates &#34;So Far So Good&#34;. Based on reviews I read prior to purchasing the software; I was very concerned about the software; especially about downloading information from financial accounts into Quicken and about importing data from previous versions of Quicken. The decision to purchase boiled down to the fact that my financial records were a mess and I needed help, would plan to enter data into the accounts manually, and no importation of data from earlier versions of Quicken would be necessary. Downloading and installation of the software onto my computer went smoothly, but tutorials were very basic and not extremely informative. Manual entry was time consuming to catch up on year to date transactions, but the process went smoothly except for a few hiccups due to learning curve. I found the default expense and savings categories to be very general and had to input my own to a significant extent, but it's good the program has that flexibility. I have just dipped my toe into downloading account information for one account so the jury's still out, but the amount of time and effort saved by downloading the data is eye opening. I haven't set up a budget yet or scrutinized spending by categories to any great level of detail, but looking at expenses from the &#34;30,000 foot level&#34; I've already identified corrections needed and am implementing them. I also have not done any tax related work with the software or looked at the investing or rental property features to any significant extent. At this point my financial data are organized at a basic level and I feel that I have some idea of what's happening. Slowly, as I gain more experience and confidence with the software I'll try the other features."
4,Very good and easy to  find it and the KEY. I couldn't misplace the KEY because it was always available on Amazon site. I put it on all of my computers. Very GOOD!
0,"Out 199.00!!! Purchased this during Deals Week (Thanksgiving), thought I had a good deal. Wished I had read previous reviews regarding problems with the download version. Kept getting 'Fatal Application Error: #1141' no matter how many times I un-installed/re-installed/ used the downloader program from AMZN to register my PC or used compatibility mode under windows 8.1 (tried XP, windows7 to no avail) etc. Finally read the no-refund policy from AMZN, great, I'm screwed. Will now try to contact RosettaStone TechSupport. Will update this review as I get further along."
0,Not what I expected- will never use -am very very disappointed.  Wish I could get my money back.
2,"I upgraded to quicken 2012 expecting a big improvement over the 2009 version I was using. Not much has changed. I've been waiting for this upgrade for a while since I don't want to use mint.com anymore. I was hoping intuit would upgrade quicken with what they learned from mint.com and apparently the product teams don't work together. The UI on mint is better. The intuit tax program was rewritten with a much better interface, why not quicken.<br /><br />I'm seriously disappointed in this version. It really wasn't worth the upgrade. I should have saved my money. I think whoever the product manager is for quicken should be retired. Let someone who wants to innovate and improve the product take the job, since the reporting and functionality is old and tired."
2,Its a slow download and I have a high speed internet and an upgraded memory laptop (its very fast) but the download still takes 15 minutes. The program said I could start using the program but I could not get it started.
2,"This is a very good product, but they are pushing the paid product WAY too hard after you install it. I understand that they want you to upgrade but the pop-ups are very annoying and tricky. I have one pop-up in particular from them warning me about a Google Chrome extension and when I remove it they want to change my search engine to Yahoo or Bing, those are the only choices! Google is the default search engine in Chrome and I have no desire to change that so I canceled it....tricky and annoying. Putting that aside, the product works well and I'm happy with that part."
3,I have a dispute with the State.
4,Easy to install on my gadgets and the best protection ever!
3,I bought to update my older Quicken program. Great update especially since you can sync online and see on phone or tablet.
2,I've been using this for many years.  The last couple of years it is pretty clear you haven't invested much in improving the software.  The annual renewal fee is currently not worth the investment.  I hope you put your attention back on this consumer software as I know you've been preoccupied with QuickBooks.<br />I'll be looking for alternatives if you don't keep it fresh and new.
4,"Easy to use as always, guides you through everything. I was worried I might have to upgrade to the next level this year, but it had enough support to deal with my Fidelity account - handled the dividends and such, just wouldn't have handled stock sales."
1,"Long time TurboTax user - have not seen a TurboTax as buggy as this one.  I am running XP box      - Crashed during install  - Crashed during first run  - Did not allow me to enter numbers in my W2 after choosing a 12c code from drop down. Had to restart the app     All this in the first hour.    On the positive side, the UI is more user friendly"
4,Avast has been an excellent service in the protection of my computer. I would recommend Avast to anyone who uses a home-based or small office setup.
2,"This product fulfills its obligation to teach basic C# programming.  The program contains 18 chapters worth of information designed to aid you in learning C# syntax and teaching you basic programming techniques.<br /><br />The lecturer is clear in his teachings and provides plenty of examples that allows you to develop your skills in C# programming.  Unfortunately, there are several problems with this program.  For instance, as you get to Chapters 16 - 18, you'll notice that the lecturer does not complete all the programs to the point where they will compile.  In chapter 17, there are numerous example programs that do not allow compilation.  One of the reasons for this is because the samples are written for VS2010 versus later versions.<br /><br />Ultimately, the product DOES teach you C# programming.  However, for more up-to-date training on VS2013 on windows 7.1 and 8.1, you should go for training with Microsoft Virtual Training Academy...oh, and MVTA is free."
4,Great product at a good price.
4,this product a Technique of computer recomed me this antivirus and I thisng  is great<br />I recomend this product to another person
4,The price was great compared to buying directly from Norton.
1,"I purchased this product because I have numerous clients.  Unfortunately, one of my clients is a Mac user and there is not an accountants copy available on ANY Mac software for Quick Books.  Which means, I basically wasted my money.  Way to go Intuit....."
3,"I'd put off using a software to do my taxes for a lot of years, but this year I finally gave in - due to some of the changes I'd heard of. I was very pleasantly surprised by this software and will probably purchase it again next year. Pretty easy to use!"
2,Home premium is good but the business tax software is poor and riddled with bugs. Every year I buy this package and I always have issues with the business portion. Even when you try to re-download the latest version the website only has previous years version and not the current version. Support is horrible for the business side and not all that helpful.  Be prepared to wait on hold for an hour to talk to someone. The chat wasn't useful either. Waiting 60-90 seconds for each response is very frustrating. I gave the package a 3 stars cuz the Premium for home is good. I would have given the business side a 1 star but the Preium brought it up.
2,"I have been using Turbotax since the DOS version in 1994.<br />Turbotax basically seems to work well but of course we could all do without the<br />upgrade-nag messages.<br /><br />I did have to use the online help chat but holy cow, it tooks two hours of waiting<br />to get through.  Once connected however, they were able to point me in the<br />right direction."

DO NOT UPGRADE!!!<br /><br />Update Aug. 9, 2015:<br />My wife's Lenovo Yoga 3, also running W8.1, got her notice a few days ago and I upgraded it Friday night when she no longer needed it for work.<br />This experience was not as smooth. The download was about 2.5GB and took a while. After the lengthy download, it started similarly to the first time noted in the original review. Then a box appeared that said something like Please Wait--We're preparing for the upgrade. So I waited. And waited. And waited. Finally, I went to bed and found the PC in the same state the next morning. Something must have gone wrong. Trying to close with the X did nothing. Using right-click and &#34;close&#34; on the task bar icon did nothing. So, I forced a shutdown using the on/off button and rebooted.<br />Then the upgrade pretty much went on its own. After another hour or two, it restarted and it's running OK. I have not used it much and will further update with more experiences.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />Got my upgrade notice and immediately downloaded from Microsoft and upgraded my Surface Pro 3 with it.<br />The upgrade experience was seamless. The whole process took less than an hour with no intervention from the user except in the first few minutes to agree to the license agreement, etc. Then the upgrade ran itself, including restarting.<br />Then we have to select express or custom setup. The express setup essentially sends Microsoft all the data it wants regarding your surfing habits, location, default apps for pictures and videos, music, etc. I selected custom setup and picked and chose what I wanted to share. Again, this was fast and painless.<br />I'm using the Edge browser on Amazon to type this. It loaded fast and has worked seamlessly so far. However, I can't find a way to use setting to specify my multiple start pages, like all other browsers, and have to add as custom pages one at a time.

The difference is that it shows live feeds such as weather, news, and stock market indices. It's as mouse friendly as it is touch friendly. Nice.<br />I timed the start up. It took about 12 seconds from pushing the power button on my Surface Pro 3 for the login screen to appear. The wireless took about 15 seconds to connect to my wi-fi.

2,"the product is probably good, don't know yet as I just installed it.  But the service to cancel my monthly support 10 minutes of recordings then another 10 minutes to call, I had to get back to work never dreaming it would take me 20 minutes to accomplish this."
4,There's enough here to keep you entertained for a LONG time.<br /><br />It's really the ticket to an artist's version of Disneyland.
1,Good product seems to be doing the job correctly
2,The pproduct works well but finding the download after purchase was tricky.
4,"Purchased \\""code\\"" from an Amazon seller for my Garmin 760 and 2 1/2 hours later this unit was completely updated from 2008 maps and ready to use. The code was supplied immediately and the update process worked flawlessly. From the previous reviews I was very carefull to READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS prior to purchasing, ie making sure my model number was properly registered with Garmin and that I was purchasing the correct maps for it. Took only a few minutes to do this even though I had lost my Garmin sign in info. and they had to send it to me. The download takes about 1 hour with my slow broadband and the \\""install\\"" about the same. Over all I am very pleased but I wish they would get the maps right for my street address...street has been here about 50 years and no changes to it but map STILL only gets me within 1/4 mile of my house!!!!"
1,"Why is it so hard to just watch movies on the computer?  I have yet to find good, reliable software.  This one is no better.  Spin the wheel and try a different one.<br /><br />It works, most of the time, eventually, but the process of getting it started is dicey.  It likes to freeze up without explanation.  Sometimes it will say it can't read the disk and the solution is to just try it again.  I'm sure they are having to work with limits imposed by the movie industry but there's no excuse for software that freezes and offers the user nothing but a spinning Windows icon as explanation.<br /><br />Incidentally, I find pausing is dicey too.  It seems to take several seconds for the sound to turn back on, so any pause requires me to restart the video a little ways behind where I was so that the sound can catch up by the time I'm back to the point where I paused it..."
1,Unbelievable! I have been using Quicken Essentials for several years and bought into the Quicken for Mac 2015 hype. And it is hype. One week after purchase and 10 hours on the 'chat' line and I am still unable to register my download. No one on the chat 'help' line has been able to help. They repeat the same instructions with the same result...nothing. And now I have been asked to wait for 4 days when they will call me to have a live conversation. I am not holding my breath.
1,"This product is a waste of money.  I have about 7 different financial institutions (mainly mid to large national institutions) and the information does not download correctly from any of them.  I was using this for personal finance tracking and for a very small home-based side business that I have.  I'm not new to Quicken (used an older version for years) and I have above average technical skills with software and I can't for the life of me figure out how to use 40% of the touted features.  I have visited the help menu, internet searched for information, and visited the \\""Quicken community\\"" on how to use the features and still can't get them to work.  I can see that dozens of other people have posted the same questions that I have, but nobody seems to have solutions.  Even doing basic things like modifying a transaction is steppy and auto categorization is very inaccurate even when I went in modified all of the settings trying to get it to work.  I spent literally a day working with the software as I liked my older version of Quicken.  I thought I was just missing something and once I fixed those few settings everything would work smoothly, but no matter what I tried nothing worked.  I gave it a few months thinking I just needed to get the hang of it, but finally removed it from computer.  The problems continued to compound as I kept using it.  My financial institutions offer free software that can aggregate your accounts that is better than this.  There are also several free online sites that you can use to do the vast majority of what this product is supposed to do (if you can get it to work).  I'd recommend checking out the free sites or your financial institutions free features before buying financial software and going with something else besides Quicken if you decide to buy.  The whole point of the software is to simplify and speed the tracking of your finances and I came away with nothing but headaches and wasted time."
2,"This software has some pretty significant bugs.  When reviewing downloaded transactions from my credit card, it often shows a pop up with the actual charge information that I can't get to go away until I fiddle around for a while.  Additionally, the program completely locks up for a few minutes after running an update to get new finance data from my online accounts.  It always comes back, but lockups shouldn't happen."
2,"After recording some events on my phone, I needed an easy way to burn the mp4 files to a DVD.<br /><br />Good points:  Wondershare is the easiest and cheapest software I found.  It easily converted mp4 files and I was able to create a<br />DVD that worked in every player.  The program allows you to create a special main menu.<br /><br />Bad points:  All the program can do is to merge all videos and files into a consolidated movie.  There is not a built in way to add transition cards, voice overs, etc.<br /><br />Conclusion:  If you need a simple and quick way to convert your cellphone movies into a DVD format, you have found the best program.  However if you want to add any special editing or formatting, you will want to purchase another program."
1,Not an improvement over the 2011 version I had.  The phone app is worthless and probably a security risk at best.  Keep your older version.
2,"Kind of ok, but a couple of bugs (or are they features?):<br /><br />Check reconciliation:  Quicken totals up ALL the prior transactions (not including those you might have manually marked 'Reconciled' or changed a reconcilied amt) to come up with a starting balance....regardless of what you put in the recon details screen.  To be fair, quicken does allow you to ask it to come up with adjusting transactions.  I've been using quicken from 1999 and this change caught me off guard and took a while to figure out what was happening and how/why to let the adjustments take place...<br /><br />Reports:  some some reason, I still don't know, one of my mutual fund accounts (VWINX is the only one, and this applies to 2 different accounts) does not come through correctly into my Net Worth report if I use 'latest dates'.  The details are all correct in the account and the value of the account is correct in the account bar...just not in the report.  If I use a some other date type, the report is correct.<br /><br />I'm also not a fan of forcing users to upgrade to the next version every 3 years to maintain online downloads.<br /><br />These are the only 'bugs/features' I've had problems with in all my years."
3,Works great no problem so far!
4,Best deal anywhere.  Now I just have to learn how to use it!
1,"slowed the system, software downloaded addl not needed add-ons and malware."
4,"I feel very secured when l turn on my computer and when l go on the internet. The fact it is free, is great for me. Because l am retired and on a fixed income.<br />Thank you Avast and all who make this happen."
0,extra hidden charges
1,"1)  It freaked out about a 1099-INT with 30 cents of interest on it.<br /><br />2)  Even worse, it totally barfed about a return that has both health insurance off the exchange and someone over 65.  Never mind that the person with the exchange policy was not the same person as the one that's over 65.  Had subsidies been involved this would have been a showstopper."
4,"I've been using TurboTax for years. It imports your prior return and goes through each step to identify whatever deductions, etc. you are eligible for. There's no way I could have done our taxes in a day otherwise..."
4,Good
1,Constantly asking me to contact support to reregister my key because I reinstall my OS often due testing different hardware. Support takes several days to respond. Easier to just rip my Blu-Rays and watch them that way.
0,Don't get trapped
1,"have been a quicken user for the last 10 years with 2 old versions,<br /> It is time to get a newer version to put on my pc.  Wow, it does<br />not import bank dump file with .OFX version. Have to get QFX version.<br />It is time to think about using other software.  Bye Bye.. intuit..<br />You suck."
3,Almost as good as Turbo Tax
2,"I do not like this version as well as my older 2006. I do not like the way the register is set up. It does not include all the items on the main screen like the older did. You have to put in a negative amount when writing a debit to the account. Adding the options you need, all to one line, make the entries too wide, and do not show on the screen.They run off so you cannot read them.<br />  In using the portfolio for Iras, it does not have a individual listing for the items in each. It does not show the shares amounts or their pricing. The way items are saved has me with two different dollar figures neither of which is correct."
3,"Nothing with taxes is ever easy, but I found entering my various 1099s was easier with this than with TurboTax, which I used for the previous three or four years.  I just wish it didn't cost 20 bucks to file my state return."
3,"I too, switched from turbo tax this year due to the price increases and loss of services. This is the first time I've used the h&r block software, and it was a breeze. Much cheaper, easily imported my 2013 documents from turbo tax, and filing federal was a breeze.  My federal return was accepted 10 minutes after submission. I didn't pay to have the state refunds efiled, so I printed and mailed them.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars instead of the max, is because it wouldn't allow me to do my non resident Delaware return online, and when I called customer service, I was on hold for 25 minutes. They did answer my question, though."
1,I've had nothing but trouble with it staying connected to service providers you have to keep deactivating and reactiveing I am going back to quicken 13
3,"They bought out spyware doctor that I used for years, so I been using this for 2 years so far.<br />So far so good.<br />I really don't have that many issues and I'm not on my PC or cell phone that much anymore.<br />I don't belong to any social site and never will.<br />Too much information and too much minute by minute non-sense.<br />I have it installed on Windows 10 with a I7 second generation laptop.<br />It found a few threats after I ran a full scan.<br />I guess I am happy with it and will buy it again from Amazon only."
1,"I make my living as an engineer.  We use English to communicate, but what we write and speak is specialized.  Same as cooks, mathematicians, lawyers, doctors, and oh yeah, architects.<br /><br />If you don't know it already, expect to have to learn their language, since they didn't bother to use plain English.  Example:  For a set of stairs, do you want a stringer at the wall?  Single stringer?  Stringer at the top?  What kind of material do you want for your newels?<br /><br />Maybe you understand this.  I don't and will have to learn the language.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />I've been trying to develop a split-level floor plan with Punch Pro.  It can be done, but the rendering is sloppy and the placement of objects in general is sloppy.  So, I decided to upgrade to a quasi-professional program, and here I am.<br /><br />I've been running this application for over ten hours, and while I'm committed to learning how to use this, I'm not, NOT impressed.<br /><br />If there were any other application on the market that I thought I could use and take to an architect, I'd drop this in a heartbeat.  Seriously.<br /><br />Initially, everything seems to be laid out logically.  You start with a floor, then you make a foundation.  Or not.<br /><br />Want a basement? Make the foundation's walls taller.  Oh.  How do I do that?  Google, that's how.<br /><br />So, now the next floor....  I need stairs to get to the basement.  How do I cut a hole in the floor?  Oh yeah.  Google.<br /><br />On and on and on.<br /><br />From what I can see, an object's attributes are tied, frozen to the floor your working on.  Want to drop a section of floor?  Go to this link where they tell you how to get this done.  [...]<br /><br />After reading it a few times, you'll get a basic understanding of the background architecture of this application.  Every object is tied to the ENTIRE floor.  Changing levels is like pulling teeth.  To create a split level, you have to create a room on the floor first.Then come completely illogical actions such as to lower the height of an interior wall, select a NEW wall with railing and draw it over the existing wall, then set the height of the wall with railing, THEN make the wall with railing INVISIBLE.<br /><br />Really?  Seriously?  So now I also have INVISIBLE objects in this drawing sucking up my computer's resources.<br /><br />No wonder they have to make so many videos to explain how their software works.  And even then, good luck finding a video that explains what you want done.<br /><br />And the camera is awful.  After you select it, you have to draw it on the floor you're working with.  Try moving it around and it's like riding a mechanical bull after too many beers.<br /><br />Not intuitive.  Not intuitive at all.<br /><br />But to part on a major lift, this program lists ICF as a structural material.  Awesome, since I'll be building with ICF.  And now for the minor fall...I have yet to see I-Beams.  (Major lift, minor fall - Anyone catch the reference?)<br /><br />One last note (no pun intended).  Last I heard, 30 X 60 = 1800.  It doesn't in this application."
1,"Download PC_Doctor this morning,  wasn't what I was expecting  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE.  I just dosen't do anything for you.<br /><br />Every time I try to run it;  wants to download again.  When runing it; dosen't help anything"
3,"If you plan on using this product solely, meaning you don't plan on transferring MS Office 2007 files to OpenOffice and vice versa, this is a great product. But if you want to, say, take an Excel 2007 spreadsheet file from one PC and work on it using OpenOffice on another PC and then back again to Excel 2007, it works but not seamlessly. OpenOffice opened the Excel 2007 file, and I could even modify the data in that file, but it would only save as a previous version of Excel compatible file (can't recall the version options), and that only if I specified it to be saved in that format. I didn't try it but imagine it's the same for Word and PowerPoint. It's a great product by itself, equivalent to an earlier version of MS Office. But if you want to work back and forth between this and MS Office 2007, it's doable but requires some finesse."
2,Useable but not very intuitive
1,"I really do not like this program.  It is not user friendly at all.  I'm kinda stuck now, but will be saving money to purchase a different program that I believe is much more user friendly.  That day can't come soon enough... save your money... buy QuickBooks!"
4,Just what I expected
0,Update 5/7/15 Quicken Deluxe just had a revision update that I installed. HORRIBLE. The balance column now only works if the transactions are sorted by date. This is ridiculous as I have always sorted by cleared with no problem. My register is full so I'm entering new transactions at the bottom of the page. When you start typing - the &#34;helpful&#34; suggestion popup lists take over the screen and I can no longer see what I am typing. It previously worked just fine and popped up beside what you typed. The category popup goes off the screen and you can't click on the split button because it has disappeared below the start-up bar. The software has &#34;forgotten&#34; that I said no to transactions it suggested to add as recurring and now I have to click no to all of them again. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS COMPANY?!?!?!?  I have used this software for over 15 years and it seems like every year they put out a buggy product with minimal upgrades. It would be nice to not have to loose information every time I buy the latest version.
0,"Long story, short.  Made my desktop completely unresponsive and caused loss of all data on my laptop.  Cost me lots of time and frustration and getting refunded nearly impossible.  I'm still trying to solve some of the problems this created on the 2 computers it was installed to.  Both are new with windows 8.1.  I wouldn't recommend it."
4,It has done a great job. We are very pleased with the product.
2,"Bought on Amazon when I realized early issues did not include the slow performance complaints noted in 2014 edition and the price dropped to $69.99 for a time.  2015 Premium is better on my 6 year old Lenovo laptop than 2014 ever was.  I experience far fewer screen refreshes than with the 2014 version.  No problems with download, install or passwords and kept multiple passwords.  Rating of 3 stars is because it is still slow on my machine -- better than 2014 but still subjectively one of the slowest software packages I use."
0,I couldn't see it was only for Mac os lion<br />I lost the money. I lost the money<br />Bad choice
2,"Ugh. I really want to make this work, but I have such a time trying to figure out how to do the simplest of things with this software. I wanted to do an auto correct on about 30 photos at once, but could not figure it out and gave up after an hour. I went to MS Windows Live Gallery, imported the folder with the pictures, selected the pictures, and hit autocorrect ... done. I admit that Photoshop can work miracles, but for me, they are few and far between. And, Premiere Elements? Only a dream of how that works! Good luck!"
4,"A quick and easy install, performs great, a must have. Will always use Norton's 360 premier, turned my whole family on to it."
2,It is so extremely different from Windows XP that I'm having a hard time finding normal &#34;buttons&#34; - even help!
4,GOOD
0,"Doesn't allow to e-file when you need continuation statements for form 8938 (which has been possible in Turbotax for years), which makes it fairly useless for anyone with a few foreign bank accounts / assets."
4,I am not that satisfied that I had to go through so much trouble to enter Sale of Investments which Deluxe does not have. in the past Basic and Deluxe enabled me to enter this info without using Premier. I guess TT needed more profits because it would cost me $69.99 instead of the $39.99 I  paid for Deluxe. I got by this fiasco this time but I wonder what will happen next year.
1,"I've used TurboTax for ten years without encountering a single blip. The programmers made tax preparation fun--until this year. The first problem occurred when I discovered the Premier version no longer allows one to account for modest rents and royalties. It required an upgrade. Even though it was free, it seemed flawed. Somehow it double counted income by filing it in two different places. I doubt the issue was operator error. It took me two anxious and frustrating days to figure out how to rectify the problem. The help line was helpful until I needed follow up advice, I was told that required an additional $100.<br />Speaking of unnecessary expenses, the cost of a second state form is exorbitant, as is the cost of filing state returns online. It seems state taxation departments should give tax filers an incentive to file online because that makes their work so much easier. Next year, I'm going to shop around because I feel Turbo Tax screwed me this year and turned what has been a fun exercise into a nightmare."
0,"If you like the idea of buying a new bluray player every 12-18 months this is the software for you.  Unlike a standalone bluray player which gets its AACS security encryption patches to play the new blurays free for life, this software expires and you will need to purchase the new software to play the new blurays.  It is a scam. Don't get suckered into buying this unless you like throwing away money every 18 months.  edit for response: I actually got this information from Cyberlink support and I have the chat log. What you are saying is simply deceiving people for sales purposes. Simply answer this, how many months will you support AACS patches for power dvd ultra free of charge? 12 months? 18 months? 60 months? 120 months? more? Give a direct answer.  There is multiple complaints about cyberlink charging for aacs patches for the ultra software."
4,"Easy to use, better price (and value) than Turbo Tax. It seems as though it has all the right tools integrated to make subsequent tax years even easier."
3,"I continue to use Quicken because I have about fifteen years' worth of financial records in my Quicken files, but if I could find another product with less bloat that would do the job, I'd use it in a heartbeat. That said, this version converted my old files and runs under Windows 7, so I'm satisfied with it."
0,"Software works fine, but intuit has really screwed their customer base with this by changing the features between different versions this year.  I have always been a deluxe user, and was able to continue using deluxe this year, but only after a few hours of trying to figure out exactly which version I could get away with.  Many have not been so lucky, and have been forced to upgrade to premium even though their financial situation hasn't changed.  If not for the fact that you get a 10% bonus when electing to receive your refund in the form of an Amazon gift card, I would have gone with a competitor."
3,"I've been using Norton for years, and it's been great at protecting my computer.  There are a few features I don't like, (mainly all the pop up window that you can only turn off for 1 day at a time), which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  That being said, I purchased McAfee about a month earlier trying to save a few buck, and got the first computer virus I've had since using Norton.  McAfee wasn't even able to get rid of the virus.  So I just uninstalled, and purchased a new copy of Norton.  Still has annoying pop ups, but not nearly as annoying as anti-virus software that doesn't work."
3,It takes a while to get use to but once you get started it gets easier. I dont like that they only give one free call to help out with your issues but that drove me to make this product the best for my skills.
1,This program should be titled Quicken for Dummies.   It only does the basic stuff and if you download it you're stuck with it.  You need to upgrade to the $84 program if you have investments you'd like to include.  Buyer beware!  And if you do still want it buy the package and don't download. Downloads can't be returned!
4,"It's fast, doesn't slow down the computer, and it's easy to use. Have been using NIS for many years with no problems."
4,"I have always enjoyed using TurboTax and the download worked great, no complaints. I will use again for my future tax returns"
3,got what I needed it was great for the price. Didn't have to pay the $109.00 for the program on microsoft.
1,"The only reason I purchased this product is that MS-Money stopped working (crashed and unusable). While it imported the Money file ok, many attributes failed to be carried over such as accounts marked as \\""closed\\"". I find many features of Quicken annoying: Closed accounts are unusable---effectively deleted; downloaded transactions are frequently (about half of them) not matched to a manual entry and there is no way to make it match (have to delete and manually \\""clear\\""); will not do on-line access to common financial institutions (Capital One); will not download correctly from Vanguard; Once you establish an on-line ID, Quicken will forget it and their password retrieval system does not work; While uploading to their cloud service works, if I add a transaction on my iPad, it is not downloaded (synced) to my PC; the Help system is structured for the business (highest) version and hence the instructions point to menus that don't exist in my version; it's SLOW; \\""Clearing a transaction on one account does not automatically clear the transaction in a linked account (i.e., a transfer).<br /><br />Ok, I'll stop. The only reason to choose this program is that there is no competition. Sure was sad when MS stopped supporting MS-Money. It was FAR easier to use."
0,"The way I see it, Intuit did me a favor.  I’ve used TTax since 1999.  I grumbled about the price increases but I was used to the interface and it did the right calcs so inertia kept me coming back each year.<br /><br />This year the TTax changes affect me (Sched D) so I took the opportunity to try HR Block.  It’s not as glitzy as TTax and it has some quirks importing from TTax but ultimately it works and has the functionality I need and is significantly less expensive than TTax.<br /><br />So thanks, Intuit, for motivating me to overcome my TTax inertia and explore alternatives.  Unfortunately for you, my inertia is now settling on HR Block for next year and beyond so you’ve lost me as a TTax customer.  But don’t worry, I still use Quicken.  For now…"
4,hello if you are thinking about it buy it I had virius kill two computers last tow years had zero problems get it today
3,Their are some knew changes from 2013 that have enhanced performance except for Portfolio  X-Ray does not come up on the screen as advertised . Can not find it. Other than this issue Program operates as advertised. I would recommend this Product.
0,"Purchased &#34;or so I thought&#34; the download from Amazon for 16.95. Strangely enough during check out a coupon was attached and no charges were billed to my credit card. Yet, It allowed my to download 132mgbts to my library to install the program. It wouldn't install because a window continuously popped up from Norton to buy the program for 19.99. Finally did breakdown and paid the 19.99 and downloaded 184 mgbts - leaving the 132 portion in the download folder. Strange I'd say. THIS WAS TOTALLY MISLEADING and I wonder how Norton and Amazon came to an agreement to do this UNDER THE TABLE DEAL. NOT Right !  I sent Norton an email complaining about this also and I may not renew next year with Norton and go to Kaspersky or elsewhere for internet security. Don't get me wrong, I like Norton - just not the way this purchase went down."
1,"Yes, Microsoft has become arrogant and has lost touch with its customers.  The idea behind Office 365 is a good one.  For a modest annual fee one stays up to date with the Office suite of programs.  I like this approach and our law firm has adopted it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the applications themselves seem to be getting worse, not better, with each \\""upgrade.\\""  Microsoft Word, the program that our firm uses most, best exemplifies this.  Word gets worse and worse with each new version and this latest version is the worst yet.  Since there is almost no competition for Word, Microsoft seems bound and determined to make the program as unpleasant as possible.  Firstly, appearance.  In Windows 365 the program is almost totally black-and-white.  It is ugly and looks like something from 1985, back when we all had monochrome screens.  You cannot even get the blue background white text anymore.  No, Microsoft has decided that at most it will allow shades of grey, with just a few color embellishments along the top, which are almost completely user-nonconfigurable.  Never mind that we all spend hours a day looking at this ugly mess and we would all like to make it more pleasant.<br /><br />I could handle the unpleasant look of Microsoft Word, but its shortcomings only begin with its ugliness.  Word relentlessly and ceaselessly \\""fights\\"" with the user over paragraph indentations, spacing, fonts, and the like.  Weird fonts and paragraph formats appear as from nowhere.  Word has always been bad about this, but this latest iteration seems to be the worst.  The \\""insert symbol\\"" function seems determined not to save user shortcut keys.  Although it says that it is saving the shorcut key in the \\""normal\\"" style, it does not.  Nor does the \\""normal\\"" style let you configure much of anything.  Instead, Word gives you a group of mostly incomprehensible styles that most users will want to ignore in favor of one that users create themselves.  Good luck with that.<br /><br />There are countless other defects in Word for which correction should have been made long ago.  For example, most modern programs, once you check an option, default to the last checked option, not to a blank check.  So for example, when inserting a \\""filename field\\"" in a footer, if the user usually checks the box to show the path of the filename and not the bare filename, this should stay checked. But no, Word makes you check this box every time--it always defaults back to unchecked.  Just a tiny example of how Word and Microsoft do nothing to make this program handy to use.<br /><br />When you reformat a highlighted paragraph spacing, there is a little box at the bottom that automatically checks itself (although amazingly it often does not show the check) that says \\""don't add space between paragraphs of the same style\\"" ... the effect of this horrid little option is that it translates to: \\""don't do what I just reconfigured this paragraph to do.\\""  Until you figure out this maddening little quirk you can reformat a paragraph until Doomsday and the spacing will not change.  Idiotic.<br /><br />In short, Word is an unpleasant program to use and it is frustrating.  It quite literally fights with the user.  This program is quite honestly hateful.<br /><br />Microsoft no doubt has convinced itself that all of these traits are just dandy -- no doubt interdepartmental politics at Microsoft has something to do with it.  This is the hallmark of a failing company -- its people spend more time dealing and bickering with one another than in listening to its customers and trying to please them.  (Look at the idiocy in Windows 8 if you don't believe me--a rhesus monkey would have known to leave in the \\""Start\\"" button.  But no, Microsoft could never do anything as demeaning as actually listening to its customers.)<br /><br />We are stuck with Word for now, but when a viable alternative arises, we will be out of here.

1,I have been a quicken user for many years 20+.  I had 2008 and was very leary to upgrade to the new 2014.  I did and now I am not sure I should have.  Quicken has a lot of work to do to keep my confidence with there product.  They need to deal with the freeze ups and speed when registering purchases into the register for each account.  I am hoping they can do some updating to fix the issues.
2,I need an instruction booklet.<br />Thank you.
1,Doesn't work well
0,Since upgrading to Quicken Delue 2014 I have had nothing but crashes. I have used two different computers with the same results.
2,"If upgrading to newer version of Quicken change your password before upgrading.  I upgraded from 2006 to 2013. Quicken 2013 does not properly convert your old password if it has more than 14 characters. It will tell you an incorrect password is being entered. BEFORE you upgrade to newer version you must shorten the password and save it in your old Quicken.  Make a backup quicken data file. Now you can install Quicken 2013, Quicken 2013 will uninstall the older version then install 2013, upon opening Quicken 2013 it will offer to open current data file or data file at a different location. Once that data file is opened it will ask for you password to open the program. If you have prepared yourself and created a short password the Quicken 2013 will open.  Now you can change your password to a longer version if you wish. Remember that there is maximum password length software bug during the conversion of your data file to a newer Quicken."
4,Excellent software package.
2,Nothing. As invasive as usual; always wants you to know it is there I guess.
1,This stuff slows things down so much it is tempting to turn the darn thing off. I won't buy again.
2,"Makes my Word program crash and loses everything. But, if I have some ideas, I can dictate into their text box, and saves me from typing the ideas slowly and forgetting them. Just save often :)<br /><br />The word recognition isn't great, but good enough for what I use it for. I go back and rewrite from this raw dictation of ideas anyway.<br /><br />Not for finished documents for sure, but definitely good for what I need it for."
2,"As other persons has outlined, the quick books is boring to look at.<br />I miss the colours in it.<br />I will explore it a bit more to see whats the difference"
4,"For me this software has been an absolute must..at my age(90) my handwriting is close to abominable and Envelope Printer has made my envelope printing chore, a pleasure..EJ"
4,"We have been using this for about 3 months now and it seems to be working ok, not having any issues with compatibility. Like the idea of being able to see docs online from any computer if you save them to your download center."
1,This version leaves alot to be desired.  I definitely prefer the previous version.  I would prefer to go back to the previous version.
2,"Ehhh, its Turbo Tax.  Hard to get excited about anything pertaining to my #$%^2& Federal Taxes.  Works well, does what it should, I guess.<br />Our tax returns are VERY simple.  No tricky deductions, expenses, investments, etc.  If I were a tad less lazy I'd just do our taxes with a pencil and printed forms.  Did it for many many years.  Could probably do with the Basic Version next time.<br /><br />Still a bit POed that my 2012 Turbo Tax return later got hammered with an additional demand from Uncle Sam for another $1700+ that Turbo Tax failed to detect, and the IRS letter so totally obscured with gibberish explanations that I just gave up and sent them a check."
2,The turbo tax I bought said 1 free state file . I filed my state tax and no had to pay for it. This is the second year in a row that this happened to me.
3,"Easy to install. Easy to update. Easy to use. And yes, there is a down side - frequent sales pitches for an upgrade."
4,I've been a PaintShop Pro user for years. It's a good product for photo editing with a lot of capabilities.
1,"not like it was describe. Not mush features, not easy . Is lest down than I'm looking for. Company should let so features working easily."
1,Desktop app is OK.  Kind of like the 2011 version I upgraded from.  I do not like the changes made to the budgeting portion of thw SW.  Often reflects actuals that haven't happened yet (or perhaps happened a year ago; can't tell because when you click on the actual amount it shows you dates but doesn't navigate to an actual transation).  Mobile app is way over-hyped by Intuit.  Often miscategorizes transactions and pulls in bank data in addition to the items you enter into the mobile app.  You get double transactions.
3,"Does everything I need it to, but the product tiers and pricing are unnecessarily complex. Strangely, it is cheaper (by a few dollars) to get the digital download from Amazon than from H&R themselves ! I may be biased because my state's returns are very simple, so asking an additional $25-$35 for state + state e-Filing seems unjustifiable."
3,"I had not updated Quicken since 2009, so was not sure that I would be happy with the new product.  It is easy to work with and supports my needs very well."
3,Movavi Video Converter 12 works quicker than other converters I tried and output is decent to good.  Lower cost than other converters I considered and worth the price paid.  Editing of clips to be converted was simple to get the hang of and nicely done for operator convenience.  Download and installation of software went smoothly and was fast compared to others I tried.
2,Software worked well.  Only wish it could also pay off the tax due.  It would have made my day for sure.
3,"I installed QB 2011 Pro on my laptop with no problem but have tried 5-6 times to install on my desktop.  2 different errors come up each time.. qb.dat and MSXML not being installed correctly... Downloaded both fixes and still have a problem.. Works great on the other computer but not my desktop...still looking for answers!!  Software is great, just the install problem.. RichardnTn"
1,"I'm not sure I made a smart decision by upgrading.  I have a relatively large quicken file that includes many hidden accounts, customized categories, and transaction rules.  I've noticed since the upgrade some of the menus acting strangely with transactions being auto-assigned to the wrong memorized payee or category.  The mobile features are cool but still only a little better than what you can get from Mint.com."
4,Best tax software for small biz! Can't beat Amazon price or service. 5 stars
4,"I have been using PC Matic on five PCs for over a year now. The virus protection which is unique with Super Shield does appear to be bullet proof as advertised. So far, I have not experienced any serious threats during this past year while relying on this product. I have 8 computers on my home network and am sad to say that some of the big name virus protection programs have really let me down in the past, allowing problems to consume way to much of my time.  My observation, however, is that there are some free utilities that seem to do a little better with some of PC Matic's extra features. They are Slimdrivers, CCleaner and Malewarebytes to name a few.  This product almost never finds driver updates, while the free utility Slimdrivers has found dozens, although not all were perfect. Sometimes installing new drivers will open Pandora's box and a user must know how to recover or roll-back the bad installation. So I can understand why each minor upgrade to these many drivers is not automatically jammed into your system. But, I'm still waiting for any major driver updates like those that I have had to fish out from support sites to be found by PC Matic.  There are a lot of statistics presented in a summary which means absolutely very little if you have multiple computers. Nothing is linked in the summary to allow easy access to the health or details of your multiple systems that are networked. Report pages should be accessible from this point. The summary seems to blindly tout this program's performance and to give the user a warm fuzzy feeling.  With that said, I would still recommend this product to my friends on the basis of virus protection alone.."
2,"I was completely satisfied with Quicken 10 or 8 or 3.  I don't use it for investments, but I did want access to my bank so I<br />felt I had to spend the money and upgrade.  As long as you do this every 3 years or so it's ok.<br />I've been using Quicken since 1998 and I love it.  Just don't mess it up with too much unnecessary stuff."
2,"TurboTax is a good program but you need to check it CAREFULLY before filing. Sometimes boxes checked, get unchecked and if you don't check everything you can get an incorrect tax return. The Intuit help is good once you get through to it and they even have tax advisors if you have questions.<br />As for the Amazon offer of a 10% addition to your refund.....it only works if you actually get a refund."
1,Quicken for Mac 2015 looks like something from a comic book. The report capabilities are somewhere between poor & nonexistent. Certainly not an improvement of Quicken for Mac 2007.
1,"I really like the idea of this product but isn't as flexible as I prefer. Furniture/design items can not be angled. That is just not logical. Walls, cabinets, etc. were very easy to install, move and resize. Also I thought the landscaping/patio would be a lot more flexible given the modern world. I will try to download some other catalogs to see if I can actually find plants (tropical) and furniture that more satisfy my taste before I give up. Not bad for very basic though."
4,"It was easy to order, the down load went without an issue, it installed right from down load location, and it was easy to use"
0,Not even sure how to download this
1,"Quicken starter is too basic to be really useful.  It does not handle loans.  I also had trouble with the Rev 7 version update and had to use what Quicken calls their mondo-update to get the program working again.  I did upgrade to Quicken Deluxe, which seems to be the right program for me.  Even though the Deluxe version was discounted, I think I still ended up paying more than if I had gone with the Deluxe version the first time.  I would also like a users manual - even if only and electronic version.  Wading through help screens makes it challenging to find answers to how to use the program."
0,i have to use quickbooks at my job and i hate it. its the best program i have used for what it does but intuit tries to get every cent from you. intuit is the devil.
4,"My family and I utilize Camtasia to create an assortment of videos.  For example, we did a product review [...] which was edited (zooms and call outs), closed captioning added, transitions, and a host of other features including working with 'green screen'."
2,"Overall a really good program. Don't like the roof designing aspect of it, I have other programs that are far more user friendly. If you don't have Design or Construction experience your going to have a huge learning curve for this one. Other than that overall it is a good program."
3,Forced me to pay  to e-file Indiana State taxes. Would not allow me to print the Indianna form without &#34; Do not file&#34;  printed in large gray font across the page.  Made addition error in tax credits for Indiana taxes therefore calculating the incorrect tax due. In the past I've been 100% satisfied. Only 80% for the 2014 version.
0,"Huge waste of money. Has to be the worst piece of computer banking software ever developed. If you have a specific date for either a deposit, like your social security check,  you can not program it in on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th Wednesday it will change it to a specific day and next month it will not show up on a Wednesday but some other week day and different ever month there after.wish I could give it zero stars Amazon should pull this ad."
3,"Quicken user since 2007.<br />The good- download, installation, conversion of Quicken 2011 files and app worked flawlessly first time without a problem.<br /><br />The ugly- Quicken ultimatum to upgrade every 3 years or lose sync with financial institutions. Also the high price.<br />Dropped one star for these 2 negatives."
4,The product continues to get better.  I have already completed and filed a partnership return as well as my personal returns.
3,"Unless my tax needs become more complicated, for simple tax purposes this is exactly what I needed. It's step by step guide and ability to import data from previous years or other Intuit products makes this easy to use and full featured for tax preperation. The software itself does have a slight tendency to hang and be a little bit glitchy which is why I took a star off and year over year there are not major changes, which leads me to wonder at the cost of the product, but for the peace of mind I haven't found another tax preparation software I find so appealing."
2,"I have used TurboTax for Business over the past couple of years.  It is really too bad that a Mac Version doesn't exist, and that an on-line version doesn't exist either.  Hopefully Intuit is going to release one next year!<br /><br />I create K1s for a LLC partnership.  The system works well for that."
1,title says it all.... wish I kept my $40 so not worth it... excel is & using my online banking stats manually works better
3,"I upgraded to OSX 10.6 and quicken would not work any more. Needed to change from quicken to another program on my mac. ibank filled in that niche. A little re-education and setting things up, but then easy transfer of files from quicken. Only thing I don't care for are the charts. I prefer a spreadsheet with all my info. Overall pretty happy and now I might upgrade to 10.7"
1,"I have used Audials software for more years than it was called Audials. It was then just called Tunebite version 4,  2006, this was before the video module was introduced . Back then as it is now there always seems to be some module of this software that does not perform as it should.  Today it is using ver. 10, attempting to convert a  DVD to a high resolution Windows media file. The copy process completes successfully, but the convert process fails. I do not recall every failure in every version, but I do recall never being able to find a solution, or relevant help, only the promise of bigger and better things in the next new version. There is seldom a lack of emails promising the latest, and the greatest.  This was adequate software when I could find DMR music to convert, but with a lack of available materials now-a-days, I have been disappointed with it the last several years."
4,They take care of the threats. It is easy to use. I hope all home surfers would consider this product.
0,"For some reason, H&R Block decided to remove the forms for any hybrid or electric vehicle tax credit.  Have been a TaxCut (H&R's first tax pgm) for years."
2,"Every time Intuit &#34;upgrades&#34; Quicken, I hope and pray that they will actually improve it. But no, their only reason for &#34;upgrading&#34; is to break my connection with my bank and hold me hostage to get it reconnected. Over the years, Quicken's reports remain clunky, hard-to-read and utterly un-customizable. There is no third heading for non-income items: if you enter something as a deposit, it goes under &#34;Income&#34; no matter if it's a refund, a gift or a transfer from another account that isn't listed. Nor is there any way to blend files -- my wife and keep our bank and credit card accounts in separate Quicken files, but at tax time it would be great to blend the two files so that two separate reports don't have to be generated and then blended by hand to create totals for the tax accountant. Can I possibly be the only human in America who would find this convenient?  Don't get me wrong, Quicken is useful -- but unfortunately it has outlasted the competition thus is not motivated to make its product more user-friendly. Investors should buy their stock since they sell a lot of units and put no money into improving their product. Gotta be a money-maker."
3,Pretty easy to use. No issues.
1,"Last year I used H&R Block software and the State tax was included and I assumed the same for this year but I was wrong!  Plus, the software did not automatically pick up the previous year's information as I assumed it would and I wasn't able to make it do that even when I pointed to the previous return."
0,"Used this software for years.... Now way to expensive.... used TaxAct online filed both fed & state for $17.95.... direct deposit received within a week, I for one will never buy tax software again."
0,Another piece of garbage software that thinks it's smarter than it's user. Inexplicably turns on mid day and starts churning the hard drive an hour or more with no way to stop it or disable it. POS.
4,"My client loves this software for his Retail Store & Warehouse. I like the new GUI, this made everything so much easier."
3,Elements 11 has helped me switch from shooting Jpeg to raw. I will never go back to Jpeg again. Everything can be done right here. No need to process raw in Lightroom first.
4,"I've been in IT for many years, and I know that most viruses are built for windows, but you're a fool if you think your Mac can't be infected.<br /><br />I was not infected prior to purchasing this product, but I knew i needed something.  I tested a lot of different AV programs, but this one seemed to integrate well, and I wanted more protection than what some of the free AV packages had.<br /><br />With Netbarrier, AV, Washing Machine I am able to keep an eye on whats going in and out of my mac from the net, keep my machine virus free, and keep it cleaned with Washing Machine.<br /><br />This was a great purchase, and i will be renewing my subscription after 1 year.<br /><br />Thanks Intego!"
2,"Okay, I have resisted using Quicken for years. I have worked with Excel to keep my personal and business finances, but after using TurboTax for several years I thought, why not get Quicken and just import everything? Well, I haven't spent that long with it, but it's not very intuit-ive (ha, ha, get it?) if you ask me. Naturally, when I get it to work, importing my data should be easier than what I have been doing. I have not heard of any other product that works like Quicken, nor one that imports directly into TurboTax."
2,Not that much of ease in Navigation for those I spoke with.
3,"Quicken doesn't add much to its products each year, but then again, Intuit pioneered the concept of the low price upgrade. Prior to Quicken for DOS, typical PC software such as Lotus 1-2-3 or Dbase 2 or any word processing software cost about $395. That was a lot of money if you factor in inflation. Many users would \\""borrow\\"" a copy from work and buy an aftermarket book to make up for not having a manual. Intuit marketed Quicken for a price that was competitive with a book alone, and eventually the rest of the industry followed. I don't know what people expect other business software to do for about 80 cents per week, but I know of no other company that's done more to cause software prices across the board to drop.<br /><br />If you upgrade once a year, you won't find a slew of new features. I found that this version is more stable, and faster to use especially when you have decades worth of data. Actions that affect multiple transactions on large registers work more smoothly and transactions are accepted more quickly. I can't speak for every bug, but the ones that bothered me in 2014 are gone.<br /><br />The new version allows you to get your credit score, but give you one score per Quicken file. You can update it periodically but not regularly, and you can't get multiple credit scores from a single Quicken file. I find this feature a moderate convenience.<br /><br />The registration process has changed, and it should work for the better. It also allows you to consolidate your passwords, but lets you leave them as is if you are upgrading. You can now have a single password for your online account that also works for your Quicken file and for your vault. The X-Ray feature gives you far more information about your investments, similar to what you get from a good brokerage website. So you now have that in the same place that you manage your finances, and you still have the traditional Quicken reports.<br /><br />The app now works more smoothly. Although Quicken doesn't claim that it's a multi user product, the app serves surprisingly well in that capacity. I have a daughter who is out of the country and is using a joint credit card and we have a joint bank account. I can see downloaded transactions as I could in the past, but we can both see and update everything with the app. We can both update records in the account at the same time, so she can snap photos of receipts and add categories. If I'm video chatting with her and she adds a category or memo to a transaction I ask about, I see it right away. This feature will work even better for a husband and wife who have access to the same accounts, but who have Quicken on only one computer. The down side for me is that although I can limit the app to see only certain accounts, I can't set it so that each device gets to see the accounts of my choosing.<br /><br />All in all, it makes for a better experience than it did in the past, and although it's not a phenomenal upgrade, people need to realize what they are getting. In addition to the product, Intuit is giving you a free three year subscription to a service that can update every single account and coordinate it among devices.  If you think of it in terms of the cost of the three year subscription alone, as many users seem to be doing, it's like getting the product itself for free on top of that. The number of improvements you get are far more if you upgrade every three years, and if you are new to the product, you get a comprehensive suite that manages all your personal, business and investing accounts as well as rental properties.<br /><br />This is priced for those who manage a moderate to large number of properties and I wish they would have support for a limited number of properties in the Home and Business version. For somebody who rents out part of a multi family home or who rents out a vacation property, it's a big price increase over other versions.<br /><br />Note: I received a complementary copy of the software, but itwas unrelated to any request for a review.was unrelated to any request for a review."
0,"I downloaded this and installed, tried to use it and it constantly locked up so I deleted it and bought something else that works great...total waste of my money"
0,They want to sell you something before you can install. what a joke!!!!  Rip off beware!!!!
0,Buyers be aware! Your TurboTax Deluxe 2014 could not be upgraded to include Schedule D unless you were using TurboTax 2013! Any other version you used last year will not be qualified for free upgrade as I was told last night in the middle of preparing 2014 tax return. Intuit should announce this restriction so that people won't spend over half an hour on the phone waiting for a decision from their support line. Call the 1(888) 777-4160 support line to find out any restriction before your purchasing the TurboTax Deluxe 2014!
0,I have had nothing but trouble with this release.  I have been working with the techs almost ever since I purchased it.  I am still waiting for a call back.  When I am working with my checking account I get an error message and the software closes down.  So far they have found that the problem is in the check number field.  it is impossible to reconcile an account without that field.  I have been using Quicken since mid 1980 and never had such a problem.<br />The next step is to bring back v 2013 and start all over again.  That would mean a loss of hours of data entry.
0,"This is the most useless program I've ever purchased. I've used Quicken on my PC for years, and have recently been using 2012. Quicken has never been great, it just seems to be the only option out there. I switched to a Mac a few days ago and love it, so I downloaded this to continue using Quicken. What a mistake. It is so featureless and simple, there's really no point to it. A spreadsheet would work better, mint would work better (and it's free).<br /><br />The main feature I miss from Quicken 2012 for PC is the scheduled transaction calendar and forecasted balance for any account, which allows you to automatically see how much money you'll have at any point in the future based on your scheduled transactions and income. Quicken essentials from Mac has nothing even remotely like this. There is no way to look into the future of your finances and budget.....so what's the point, really? Ibank is the only program for mac that I could find that has this function. It's a little more expensive but at least it has a free trial.<br /><br />Bottom line: save your money and headaches, use mint or a spreadsheet for free if they'll work for you, or if you want more functionality check out ibank.<br /><br />Oh, and there's no refunds on downloaded products so beware."
0,"Last  year I used Turbotax to complete my federal and state refunds without a problem.  This year, I decided to use HR Block's tax software because it was priced more competitively.  I was very disappointed with the product.  The software had difficulty installing from the disc it was shipped on.  It would consistently freeze and give me errors when installing.  I was only able to successfully install it by copying all of the files from the disc onto the computer.  Once I had the software installed, I found it relatively easy to use.  The software asked basically the same questions as Turbotax, and was straightforward for someone like me who had a very good idea going in exactly what their taxes should look like.  I had all of the information entered within an hour of starting my return.  I was ready to efile my federal and state returns, when the software claims it was running a final accuracy check (it had already run a similar check for both the federal and state forms individually).  The software returned an error in the healthcare coverage/subsidy forms and directed me to the appropriate place to address it.  I had entered all of the information correctly, but the software was poorly written and was not able to use that information to correctly fill in the official IRS form.  The software left an important box blank on the official IRS form even though I had entered that information into the software earlier.  The software would not allow me to correct the form.  I attempted to use their online chat support to address the cause of this problem.  This process was a nightmare.  I waited for over an hour to chat with an agent.  The agent was thoroughly unhelpful.  Their entire online support process consisted of telling me over and over again that I should go back and check that I entered my information properly.  Several of the questions and responses by the support agent demonstrated that they had no working knowledge of the software.  After an hour of this unhelpful dialogue, they told me that this was a known issue and there was an update that would be out within the next week.  There was nothing they could do to help me.  This was a frustrating experience and delayed filing my return and getting my refund.  I asked for HR Block to address their deficiency by waiving the state efile fee since their software was the cause of the problem.  The agent ignored my question multiple times.  I know I will be returning to Turbotax next year, I recommend you all skip the headache I went through with HR Block this year.  Update: While my Federal return was quickly approved and my refund paid, my Virginia state taxes have been held up.  I have no way of knowing for sure but I suspect the software somehow messed up a form that got me flagged for an audit.  I'd give this product negative stars if I could"
2,"I am disappointed with Quicken 2014 over 2013.  Performance has slowed down considerably.  One Step Update is slower and \\""buggy\\"".  Sometimes Quicken will just shut itself down (abort) during One Step Update.  It can take half an hour for just a handful of bank accounts to update.  I am using Quicken 2014 with Windows 8.1.  I was much happier with Quicken 2013.  I have considered converting back.  I do not see increased functionality to offset the lost speed and difficulty with One Step Update."
4,this is my second year with Norton I lost a few computers to viruses etc and since getting NORTON I don't have to be a mastermind to set this up it does almost everything it's self I love it.
4,Easily the best simple envelope printer program out there.  Excellent user interface and easy to use.  A must have for any small office.
3,"great product,have used it for years., i am a bit frustrated about the line by line assist keeping me from Forms Only mode!"
4,This is a great way to process (workflow) you photos while traveling. We have LR5 loaded on our MacBook Air to process all of our digital photos. I cold go into all the cool functions but I found the workflow tabs and its cataloging to be the strongest points of this system.<br />Its very easy to build catalogs to keep track of all your images.
4,"The download worked perfectly.  No problem at all, except for the time that it took which has nothing to do with the purchase of this item.  I used Firefox.  As others have suggested, connect your unit to the Garmin website to check to make sure it is registered correctly, and that it has the latest software before you start.    If you use Mapsource, there is a check box to load the maps on your computer as well as the Garmin.  Make sure you check that box, and then you will have the newest maps in your Mapsource program as well."
3,"does the job, much much better than Essentials.  Easy to set up.  Wished it had more financial institution options so I could load all my financial stuff.  Sync with the mobile app is a very nice feature and you can add a 4-digit passcode for added security on your phone.  Especially convenient if your balances are running low.  Alerts are helpful."
1,"Not only does the software require updates every other day, now the application automatically shuts down a few seconds after I log in.  I have followed all trouble shooting instructions, including but not limited to, updating my OS, and uninstalling and reinstalling TurboTax.  Awful product, save yourself time, money, and frustration by using a different tax prep service.<br /><br />Fingers crossed I can get a refund, I'm not holding my breath.<br /><br />**Update**<br /><br />email from Intuit:<br />\\""You contacted us in regards to an issue you are having with a TurboTax Deluxe download you purchased through Amazon.com. Please reach out to them for a refund.\\""<br /><br />email from Amazon:<br />\\""I apologize you are having difficulty with your software after the recent Intuit updates, however because of the time period being beyond 60 days, a Intuit guarantee does not apply, and we are not able to refund the purchase. I would advise working with Intuit further to remedy the problem you are having with your version.\\""<br /><br />**Update 2**<br /><br />Amazon was able to process a refund for me."
3,Relatively easy to us.  Easy to backtrack if you think you've made a mistake.  Good alerts to be sure you followed instructions and correct if mistakes have been made.
1,The safe money portion .was very difficult to set up.  Only after many contacts with Kaspersky was I able to get it work...windows 8.1
3,"I don't understand all the negative reviews, has worked fine for me"
0,Will not upload last years and state not working correctly. Have to use free version and buy another state tax.
4,"It does what it set out to do. Keeps my computer free from virus's , and I am pleased with it."
0,"I have never visited a site as clunky as the 365 download page. It freezes up, it gives me error messages 5 minutes late, and error messages disappear before you can read them (don't take your eyes off of the screen!).<br /><br />Microsoft is an embarrassment. It's time to split up the company and sell off the parts.<br /><br />Looking forward to being disappointed with the software...."
2,"It works, i think.  Easy to install but not easy to turn off temporarily. The price was right."
1,"I downloaded the software and updated the data, but cannot register the software so I can't download new transactions.  I am disappointed that the software is not recognized by the quicken web site."
0,"I have more issues trying to download this software!!  I should have known better when I tried the free demo of this software!!  Tech were of little help!  I will not buy any more software from Amazon.com, books yes, software no way!!!!!"
3,I have only used Photoshop Elements 12 for a short time; it does not let me straighten a photo.  Windows Life Photo Gallery lets me straighten a photo very easily in a single step.
0,"Right off the bat, Quicken couldn't link to my bank.  Now I'm stuck inputing my entire checking and savings account manually.  The program itself isn't all that intuitive.  I'm not sure I'll realize the value for my money.  I suspect there are features I'll never find or understand on my own."
2,As a beginner I needed a break from lessons that just teach repetition of new chords. I really like being able to clearly see how Murphy's fingers are positioned and she delivers very good directions. The speed at which I change chords has definitely improved. I would enjoy this DVD better if different songs were chosen. I am not excited about displaying my skill at playing 'Skip to My Lou' for anyone.
4,Needed a WMA to MP3 converter. This one is great for that process. It will store the file in it's own folder or you pick the folder you need it to go to. Great help!
1,"It Stated that it would allow you to use your smart phone to check.  It only supports I phones and Android phones, it does not support Windows phones and when I contacted them they state that there is no intention of allowing Quicken to work with a windows phone.  I feel that I was taken since it was not stated that it did not work with windows phones.  I might as well kept my 2013 Quicken since it does not provide ANY additional benefits."
1,I bought this software on Amazon because there was a $25 discount on future purchase.  The discount does not show on my account and to date has not applied to any of my purchases on Amazon. I am not happy with the way this discount was advertised or explained. It's a bait and switch in my opinion.
4,"This software is really easy to use, step-by-step. I would recommend. I needed software to be able to file s corp with, this version lets you file easily."
0,"This product is so misleading by stating that you get the federal and state plus federal efile and state, which led me to believe that you received one free state efile.  Even at the bottom is states &#34;Includes 5 Free Federal E-Files and one download of a TurboTax State product&#34;  which led me to believe that you have a free state efile.  When calling turbotax I was greeted with a representative that said that turbotax has never offered a free state efile and when I stated that they had, I was told absolutely NOT!!  So I said instead of arguing with you, thank you for your time and hung up!  I think I will have to consider H&R Block tax software!!!!"
2,"For fear of taking up too much time writing something that no one will read all of the way through I will just say that this product is clunky, doesn't work well even on my high end gaming computer (slows down, locks up, doesn't like large video files, etc).  There is little, if any, included walkthroughs for the novice, the choices of &#34;Auto Movies&#34; are really lame... and it's just (in my opinion) a really bad product.  I spent a fortune on 5 different brands of Video Editing Software and this one comes in maybe as # 3 of the 5 brands I purchased.  If you have very small movie projects that don't require a lot of editing then maybe consider this product.  If you have large video files that require lots of fixing (like old VHS footage) than you definitely want to look at some other brands... My favorite... Sony!"
1,"It seems like every year Kaspersky finds a new way to be obnoxious to people who paid money for their product. Last year was the year of the bi-daily popup notifications for the entire last month before the product expires. This year it's this new thing where they will bombard you with popups until you register the product. Even putting on the gaming mode, which supposedly doesn't let notifications interfere with fullscreen programs doesn't apply. They will continue to badger you until you do it. What's ridiculous is that the software was registered under my name a long time ago, all I did is renew with a new code.<br /><br />The software is fine for the most part, with the exception of a couple of annoying quirks, especially things like services not turning off when you tell them to. This might actually be a big deal to some people. It's mostly unobtrusive though, and seems to be on top of things as far as monitoring. I'm sick of it though. I'm going to be looking for new antivirus software when this expires this year.<br /><br />Thanks for making me regret giving you my money for the past number of years!"
2,I have used TurboTax for over 20 years without any problems until this year.  Apparently the Massachusetts non resident form has some bugs which caused my refund to be reduced.  I challenged the reduction and am waiting for a response but I needed to go back and verify everything input into TurboTax and the resulting tax form.  I pay extra to get the state return as I trusted TurboTax but this year I would've been better off doing my state taxes on my own.
1,I upgraded to 2013 because I was informed by Intuit that I would no longer have access to one-step downloads of data unless I did so.  The new program freezes constantly and does not download data properly.  It does not interact well with certain financial sites.
4,Product met expectation's... Product downloaded seamlessly and the prior year's information downloaded correctly.  I have used TT for 10+ years.
3,"Overall better design and more options than older versions, but it is not compatible with them so for win 8 you need to either buy both PM v6 and PM 18 or just buy PM 18 if you want to be able to use your stored files. We unfortunately bought PM v6 first never thinking it wouldn't be backwards compatible, and when it wasn't our office manager freaked out a bit-but we then bought PM 18 to be able to access older signs, etc. They are pretty cheap so not really a big deal but they should have some kind of conversion program a la .doc to .docx."
2,Is a nice software but looks old and out of date
3,"I have used these products for some years, and found them okay,<br />good for organising and editing your photos and much more.  However being an Adobe product the support in<br />my opinion is not as good as it should be for the price you pay.<br /><br />anyway it organises your pics and sorts them and allows you to back them up, important, and it is very good for editing video presentations too.<br /><br />Even in my mind  there could be more done here to improve presentation, photo properties and analysing individual pic information, which has to be searched for (unlike other versions which were clearly displayed.).<br /><br />But the adobe tools are there to do many functions for your photos to improve change or manage.<br /><br />out of 10 I would give 7/10.<br /><br />to sum up in the digital pic world there are few products like this and have these features, I would recommend you look at this product if you are searching for something to organise and prepare your digital memories."
4,Norton Antivirus. Excellent product does not slow down the computer and gives the basic protection which is good enough for the average user who is not interested in phorn sites. I love Amazon.
3,"There are some great new features in this version, especially the 1-button selection of which customers have time/expenses so it's easy to invoice. The download was simple and fast. The look of the layout is different (left sidebar) and I'm not sure I like it as well but I'm getting used to it now."
4,"Works great, gives me updates and lets me know when something is not right immediately."
2,"This is my second year using the Business edition of TurboTax. The year before that, I used TaxAct's business edition, and I can say that I think TurboTax is superior to TaxAct. However, I did not notice any improvements in this year's version over last year's. I ran into a couple of issues:<br /><br />1. There is a section near the end of the program where you need to print and scan Form 8453, save it as a PDF and attach it to your return. If your scanner does not save documents in PDF format, a TurboTax PDF Printer Driver can be downloaded. For the life of me, I could not get this to work. I searched the internet for a solution to the error I kept receiving - \\""Printer not activated, error code -30\\"" - with no luck. I ended up taking the printed document to work, scanning it there and emailing it to myself.<br /><br />2. I dissolved my corporation last year, so there were a few extra steps I had to go through in TurboTax this year to Dispose of Business Property. The program asks how the assets were dissolved - sold, given to charity, etc. When it came to Intangible Assets, though, I got stuck in a loop of questions that never correctly dissolved them. It kept sending me back to the main Income page. Finally, I went into Forms Mode and manually typed in the disposal dates, etc.<br /><br />A couple of other areas for improvement that I would suggest:<br />-After importing the business QuickBooks file, assigning the correct Tax Line to each item is very cumbersome. Please think of an easier way to do this. At the very least, copy & paste spreadsheet-type functionality would be better.<br />-Each time the software is opened and updates are downloaded, a message always appears to let you know that TurboTax is restarting, but it NEVER restarts. Is it just me?"
1,I did not like the separation out of the Small Business forms.  It was to much of a hassle to get the upgrade after the taxes were already started and not cost efficient for the smallness of the business.  Next year I will use something different to fit my needs if TurboTax has not put the forms back in the Deluxe software.
2,"I prefer what I had before but this works.  It is extremely easy to use, understand and very reasonable.  I just wish they would quit changing things...leave them alone!"
0,"Really should not have been released in this form. Way too many bugs! Not just little stuff, but things like estimated tax payments and business mileage are not being handled properly. I bought it early to do some last minute estimating for year-end moves, and it is utterly useless for those of us with self-employment income. I have been using this for years, but I may actually go back to the paper versions because of the poor testing.<br /><br />Seriously, get some new faces for your tax &#34;experts&#34; too - they are the same ones for about the last 3 years, and they still have the same years of experience! Yes, I opened them up side-by-side, same people at the same spots. But mostly, test your software before releasing it."
2,"It's okay, but back with the free AVG version. I personally don't like all of this cloud on-line crap. Just need a simple to use monitor."
1,"Microsoft continues to shoot itself in the foot by pushing out bloated software, even on the Mac.  Worse yet, they can't seem to figure out how useful OneNote would be to add to this package.  I use it because I have to for work, otherwise I rely mostly on Google Docs nowadays, along with Keynote for presentation development."
3,"I've been using this software for probably 4 years now.  It used to be called &#34;TaxCut.&#34;  It works well enough.  It walks you through an interview process and prints the documents for you.  It took me maybe an hour to do my taxes.  We have a pretty simple return, but, I don't trust my self well enough to do it manually."
1,"Its a nice product, however you get more with the free Mint version."
1,"Each year Turbo Tax becomes more complicated, less user friendly, and didn't carry forward my figures from last year.  It also prompted me to claim a deduction causing underpayment to the IRS. I will not use Turbo Tax again."
3,Truly makes my life easier doing my own taxes.
3,Can not get company to quit asking me to register and I do it every time and it says registered already. Fixed my laptop and desktop great program 1 minor flaw
3,"I upgraded from Quicken Essentials to Quicken 2015 for Mac. I haven't had any major issues, but I mainly use the basic features of the software. The only issues I've noticed is the layout isn't as palatable as Quicken Essentials and I've had problems getting my transactions to download for one of my accounts, but that could be an issue with my bank. Overall, it does what I need it to do."
1,"I am not pleased with this version.  I have used PS since the 90's.  I am having trouble working with the mailing labels.  I expect to get a sheet to work with, but is one label.  What am I doing wrong?  I think to past version was much easier to navigate.  Any help would be appreciated.  Maybe when I learn this new PS I will love as I have in the past."
2,It's okay
2,Overpriced software that Microsoft knows can scam you into buying because you NEED it for school.
3,"the thing I didn't like it was very hard to install, it was confusing, it did not remove from screen the step you completed, then if you did the step again it still does not say that step was already completed"
4,"This works great and is very easy to use.  I've used it w/ a mini label printer and on a standard PC -- great results, every time!"
1,Not as informative as TurboTax and extra state is more pricey.
2,I miss the clipart that my other desktop publisher had...
1,Budgets and budget reports are broken upon conversion.  Menus for the dropdown items on the top toolbar don't always disappear. I'm going to have to research alternatives after being a customer since 1987.  The thing that really gets you is that they force you to upgrade and then the product is broken.
0,I'm disappointed this doesn't work on a Mac.
2,"TurboTax was able to figure out how badly they messed up and get me the right version for the right price.  If they don't get this fixed next year as they promise I will be changing this rating to a 1-star rating.  I should not have had to deal with this.  When I buy the same version of a product and it lacks the features that EVERY previous version has contained, I have a problem."
2,"UPDATE 2013/04/04 (April)  I did finally get it to work.  It seems like it's going to be useful and maybe even fun but I've only had it up and running about a day and a half.  It took many hours over several days...trial and error mostly...to figure out what PowerDirector did not remove in the uninstall so it could actually start out fresh.  As I've had to do with quirky software in the past, I had to search the hard drive for any folders or files that might remain after uninstalling.  Then, I search the Windowws Registry to find things of the same ilk and I try deleting them.  Of course, before starting the process, I have to image my OS partition to be prepared in case I massacre the OS files to the point of no return.  I don't know which \\""delete\\"" made the magic because I did multiple things at once...however...it now will launch and run.<br /><br />Cyberlink did finally respond with human (rather than bot) intervention.  However, they want me to send screenshots, dxdiag logs, and a whole bunch of other stuff so they can analyze.  Well.  I'm up and running on my own so I'm going to politely decline their offer.  If they had asked for that a few days ago I might have done it but I don't know that would have helped any.  I think it would have just been more busy work designed to keep me offline and out of their way.  We now know the fix was deleting stuff.  Tech support will never advise you to delete stuff from the registry.  They know 90% of their customers can't do that.<br /><br />So, the basic install works.  But, in addition, there are some additional \\""content\\"" installers that are part of the Ultra package. One is a separate 1.7 Gig installer called \\""essentials\\"" and then there's a 0.9 Gig installer that is called \\""premium\\"".  I haven't had the nerve yet to try them although I want to because I guess that's where the snazzy transititions and effects are harbored.  I'm just not ready for more installation problems right now.  Maybe some day after I've had a few martinis I'll be ready to do the deed.<br /><br />Oh, and get this.  The update/patch files at Cyberlink carry a payload.  Oh, yes.  It's true.  You have to carefully decline a Google installer when you run an update.  How about that?  You're in trouble so you run to get a patch to fix broken software and they slip a Google thing in there.  Really?  Is that they way to do it?<br /><br />UPDATE 2013/03/30:  It did take 12 hours to download from Amazon. So, consider the \\""download\\"" option to be similar to a \\""next day\\"" delivery.  I still cannot use the program.  It did nothing but crash so I tried the uninstall/reinstall routine but now it won't launch as it complains that it is cannot find MFC90U.dll.  (Of course, that's a part of Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 runtime and CyberLink installs that runtime as part of its install routine.)  When I contact CyberLink support through email, they only regurgitate and reflect my statements back to me or they answer a question that I did not ask.  It's as if they have a bot program autoresponding and I think that is the case.  CyberLink support is of no help whatsoever but I must continue to hammer away at them hoping I'll eventually land upon someone or something that knows something and is willing to share because Amazon does not accept returns of downloaded software.  And, of course, I'm Googling like crazy trying to find a fix.  If I figure something out, I'll come back to post.  I suspect others will experience this problem.  In the meantime, my $58 for the software has only left me with a big obstacle to overcome so I can troubleshoot CyberLink's software for them.<br /><br />MY ORIGINAL REVIEW POST:<br />It will take over 10 hours to download this from Amazon's server.  Something is very, very slow.  Web page for CPD11Ultra says it's 654 MB but when you fire up the Amazon download manager to get it, you discover it is actually over 3 Gigs.  That would be okay because I've got a good fast fiber optic connection but something isdragging the bits through sludgy mud before they get in the stream.  The server is doling out the bits so that over 4 hours have passed and I've only got about 1.2 Gigs of the total 3.21 Gigs. The Amazon download manager says there's another 8 hours to go!  It's going to be 12 hours waiting for this application.  Adding to the anxiety, however, is the expectation that the installer will fail because some bits are whacked and I'll have to restart a 12 hour download again.  I'm pretty sure this will make me shy away from Amazon's other download services (movies, software, games, etc.)  I called Amazon customer service.  They could see what I was trying to download but said they couldn't do anything to speed it up.  So, here I sit.  4 hours down and another 8 hours to go but I'll be in bed by then!<br /><br />2013/03/30 ELABORATION ON TODAY'S UPDATE<br />I still can't use the program.  It did nothing but crash when I tried to encode a short movie time line.  Naturally, the next intervention was to uninstall and reinstall.  Tried that.  Now, I can't launch the program.  It complains that it cannot find mfc90u.dll.  Turns out that's a Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 file.  Cyberlink PowerDirector installs an old version of M$ Visual C++ 2008 during the PowerDirector installation process.  So, why can't PowerDirector find its own files?  I think that's a question that CyberLink should easily be able to answer.<br /><br />I believe my download from Amazon was intact because the Amazon download manager utility ran a MD5 hash check on the files and it reported that all was okay.<br /><br />It's frustrating when I consider that CyberLink has sold thousands of software packages.  You know that my problem cannot be unique.  It must have happened to many.  And, yet, when I contact the people who coded the software, all they tell me is a repeat of the things I say in my email query.  I tell them I have already installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled.  Their answer is to uninstall andreinstall.  Do they think that just because they say it then it will be effective even though I have already done that?<br /><br />Obviously, the CyberLink uninstall/reinstall routine is flawed.  That's why it can't find the Microsoft C++ 2008 runtime that CyberLink put there.  So, what good does it do to tell me to do that over and over?  If it failed, then it will continue to fail.  Only CyberLink coders can determine why that is so.  But, the problem won't get past the CyberLink bots!  The bots just keep saying uninstall/reinstall!!!"
1,After I down loaded it it said it was the wrong one then I had to down load another one.  I'm not sure but I think I was charge twice
0,This wouldn't download on my computer. I had to contact Amazon. Fortunately they made an exception and refunded my payment(software downloads are normally not refundable)
3,"What's to rate, a quality program for sure. What else can anyone say about something that's been around as long as Acrobat?"
4,"I was thankful I was able to purchase this & download ASAP!!! Not being protected these days is the worse thing, & easiest to forget about.  To many people are able to access your information.  I would advise everybody to keep up with your computers virus ware coverage dates but if your like me & have a lot to do don't worry Amazon is here for you :)"
0,I couldn't get the product and Microsoft Customer Service couldn't be bothered to help me after it was already paid for.
0,"I have to use this, why, well because Intuit is a monopoly. And what happens when you have a monopoly, you have a product that sucks with a company that doesn't care. Called their tech support line at a customer site a couple weeks ago and not only could I not understand the person but they actually were struggling to speak the English language. He couldn't even tell me what was on the screen of the computer because he didn't know what to call it. I really wish companies like this would go out of business."
1,"I used an older version of quicken for years.  All I ever had to do was click on the desktop icon and open my register.  Now I have quicken 2014, and getting to my register is a major event.  I have to choose a location to restore the file to, which is the desktop, and then click restore.  Why restore it when all I need is to access it?  If I backed the file up to a portable drive and don't have that with me, I can't access the most recent version.  It's got me saving the darn register in half a dozen places just so I have it available when I need it . . . .which is usually quickly.  Why all this rigamarole to get to my account register?  How do I bypass all that?  My computer, in my home, I'm the only user, and it's my information.  All I need is an icon on the desktop that I click on and walah!  my register appears.  This obstacle course has seriously got me thinking about using another system.  Don't know what yet, but I'm looking!"
3,"I have been using Norton 360 for the last 4-5 years and I must say it does the job of keeping the computer free of malicious software, at least for the kind of web surfing I do.So, if you do not visit sites that might be hotbeds of viruses, this program should work. It doesn't slow down the computer excessively and unless there is a compelling reason to change, I'll probably stay with it for the foreseeable future."
0,"Don't &#34;sucker&#34; for this download.  After you load data into it, you find that it updates itself, and you lose all your data.  Steer clear!"
1,"If I had a viable option, I would jump ship from QuickBooks immediately.  I need inventory management and this system is horrible.  Yes, the software does what it promises, but I simply cannot stand all the ads for credit card processing, banking services, etc., etc. that Intuit forces me to look at every day.  I mean, seriously, why would I want Intuit to process credit card transactions for me?<br /><br />I cannot state how much I hate Intuit as a company.  The service is truly awful in every way and they relentlessly try to charge you higher prices than you need to pay for their products.<br /><br />If I could rate the company, I would give them zero stars.  One of the worst companies I have dealt with."
0,Not good at all..
0,"Useless program if you have to calculate AMT. There are no instructions, help, or guidance for AMT in the program. TurboTax Support could not and would not give help! This is a serious problem! You will not be able to complete your taxes. AMT is extremely complicated. You are dead in the water!"
2,"My biggest beef is that I can't sort a report. In the PC version I could create a report and then sort it by columns. Not with the Mac version and that is a problem. Also I like the look of the PC version better. The Mac version seems as though it is missing stuff because the interface is so sparse compared to the PC. Nevertheless, I can still do most of what I could do on the PC and I love having it on my Mac."
4,"I am actually a &#34;ex-tax&#34; professional.  I've been using TurboTax for a really long time.  I love that a beginner with little knowledge and a relatively simple return can walk themselves through their own tax return, so I recommend it often.  But, the reason I use it is because it also allows me to skip all the hand holding while still letting me know about tax law changes I need to consider. Transferring all the data for prior year returns is simple, too."
3,"It will do all I want and more, but it's hard to figure out, even with an online manual. Thanks."
2,"I have used Quicken for several years, but this new version did some really screwy things when I first downloaded it.  It took several times of having to recreate all the entries for the past year & a half to get things right, but it seems to be working fine now-- not sure what the problem was, it just seemed to &#34;have a mind of it's own&#34;."
4,"I have been using Quickbooks Online for the past year to manage my photography business. While a longtime Quickbooks user, the online version has been a huge upgrade. I appreciate being able to sign in from any location, no matter where I may be working throughout the world. It is user-friendly, a quick learn and overall a very solid product."
1,I have to say I am less than impressed with this product. I liked the idea of the new features but none of them work with my situation. I have accounts in various different currencies and the new features cannot deal with that . They only report dollar accounts. Also you cannot enter a paycheck unless it is going into a dollar account. Useless to me. Not worth the money.
1,it does not recognize printers and I am not enough of a geek to figure out  work around. I don't think I should have to figure it out if the software was<br />working properly. Wasted 50 bucks as far as I am concerned.
3,I feel very safe performing my daily task using this software.  Plus it's not a resource hog like some other security software.
3,"I'm used to working with Word on a Dell desktop, but I have an iMac at home. The Office Mac Home and Student 2011 seems to be a good product, and well worth the money.  I give it a &#34;thumbs up&#34;."
3,Very easy to use and clear instructions on what information was required to complete forms.
1,Be careful buying this product.  it is full of bugs.  It does not work if you have any older version of Quicken on your machine. I was upgrading from a 2010 version.  It only works for me now because I had to have my operating system reinstalled (not due to Quicken).
1,I expected something else.  Soon had to replace my laptop anyway due to problems with it's performance and  a different internet security was bundled with the new laptop.
3,"I was forced to purchase this version of Outlook by Comcast because they &#34;didn't support&#34; Outlook 2003, which was working fine for me. This is the same version I use at work, so I am OK with it - BUT OH MY GOD does it run slow at times! Especially when downloading 100+ emails first thing in the morning. Also, keep an eye on the &#34;social media&#34; add-ons it will automatically download, they slow this application to a C-R-A-W-L. Only download what you REALLY need."
4,Great price and protect up to 3 computers. It wont cover an Ipad however but works great on my 2 PCs. They had a virus and it took it out!
3,"This is my 4th version of Quicken...2015 seems to have some very nice bells and whistles, but I'm noticing some slow response times when I reconcile accounts (checking, etc.).  Also, the programmers seem to love the color white...makes differentiation on line items a bit tougher."
1,Not very user friendly at all.
4,Avast is the best antivirus program that I've experienced. I would recommend to anyone that has a computer and the free version is very secure. Thanks avast!
4,Thumbs up!
3,"I bought this product to watch my Blu Ray movies on my PC.<br />For this and almost any other video and audio format it works great.<br /><br />I found only one point of improvement that I would recommend for the Corel people.<br />Please allow this product to work in a virtual environment.<br />I use VMware's Workstation and wanted the blue ray to operate in Windows 7's Virtual Machine... oops the program says \\""NO CAN DO\\""... I think it is somewhere near Kathmandu ??? ;)<br /><br />apart from that one little glitch I highly recommend this application to play your Blu Rays, DVD's, VCD, mpeg etc..."
0,"Had to uninstall it to get my computer programs and printer to work.  After 4 hours working on it, their technician gave up."
0,Blocked necessary programs. Had to uninstall it.
0,"After years away from Quicken, I bought it for my new MAC. Inexplicable download errors and after three attempts, gave up on support. Extremely disappointed with product and lack of support. Do not buy this product."
4,because i love it and all my friend have it and they work on maxwell air force base and they only used the best<br />  THANK YOU.
1,I like Quicken but I did not find any difference between 2012 and 2013. Not knowing that I would  not have brought the 2013 program.
2,okay
1,"It was worth a try since it was free.  Since I had to pay this year I decided to get a second opinion using TurboTax.  I liked it better, but more importantly it saved me about $200 in taxes over TaxAct.  I'm not sure why the calculations were so different between the different products.  If you have very simple taxes this will probably work fine.  I had some inheritance issues that made my situation more complex than normal."
2,"I have been a quicken user for a very long time.  I love that it makes balancing the checkbook easy and accurate.  I am not happy that this version (and 2014) continually goes blank on the screen, especially when I am balancing an account.  I have to close it and open again.  Fortunately, I do not have to start over.  It is frustrating though.  I do not usually upgrade every year, but I wanted to this year as I thought the blank screen would be resolved.  No so.  I have tried all the tricks recommended on the web and none have worked.  Even with this frustration I will continue to use Quicken."
1,"Timed out, spent over an hour on the phone with TurboTax (Amazon will not refund for software purchases), and I did not receive a refund from turbo tax either.  I will not be downloading software on Amazon.  I love Amazon, but I choose not to download software from there site."
3,Easy To Install. I Like It Better Than Norton Internet Pro. Norton Internet Pro Was Removeing My Desk Top Icons With Out Letting Me Know
2,It took a while to try and figure out all the ins and outs of using the soft wear since it is very different. Also would not allow me to transfer from an older version do I lost a large amount of data due to the entirely different format.
0,Bought this year after year they never give you a deal always hidden cost.
1,"WebPlus uses fixed, not dynamic, page sizes.  This means that your site won't, for example, adjust the page width when the user changes the size of their browser window.  It also means that when you add new content, you'll most likely be fiddling with page size and frame size by hand.<br /><br />To quote from the online forum, \\""webplus uses absolute postioning and will not automatically stretch the page to fit what ever screen resolution the site is being viewed on, html software such as dreamweaver does however support fluid pages.\\"""
1,No firewall
0,its very pretty but it does not import current data from my bank. i can see the transactions in my bank's online system but Quicken does not find anything to import.<br /><br />I don't need to pay $75 to analyze archival data; i can get historical data for free.<br /><br />Slowken might be a more appropriate name for this.
0,Try to install on vista will not install even with quicken support on help line. they have no clue how to get it installed. dont buy this product untill they get better support. total waste of money. will stay with 2014 version which will be my last quicken. buyer beware sums up this release.
4,Easy to use software that provides good guidance and explanations. Very happy with the product provided and will use again.
0,Charge was excessive as compared with purchasing the program at a store like Staples
2,the code for free efile did not work. otherwise the program worked fine.  this is the second year the code has not worked.
1,"It's most unfortunate that QuickBooks REQUIRES an upgrade every three years with new features that are minimally helpful. Each &#34;upgrade&#34; is a royal hassle that takes time and money. In 2016, when QB requires me to upgrade again, I would gladly pay $400 to avoid the ordeal."
0,"I'm running Windows 7, not that that matters, because the installer you download from Amazon does not contain the data files!<br /><br />I extracted the installer.exe which contained an .msi file, then I extracted that, and the only contents were a single .exe file (the program itself).<br /><br />So installing this program normally gives an error saying:<br />There should be '3D Muscle Premium 2_Data'<br />folder next to the executable<br /><br />OBVIOUSLY. It didn't exist in the installer .exe in the first place! Neither did it attempt to retrieve anything from the internet!<br /><br />Bad review until these guys fix this. It really looks like a scam at the moment."
2,needed to upgrade my word processing program but I'm still learning how to use it.
4,"None of us enjoys tax time, but I've been using TurboTax for over 20 years and it's made that unpleasent task easier. Each version has been better than the last. Keep it up, Turbo Tax."
3,"I was annoyed by the forced upgrade.  I liked the fact that I could transfer part of my refund to Amazon, and I got a 10% bonus.<br />I love Turbo Tax.  I trust them a little less because I had to do the forced upgrade, but I am still loyal.  It's like when your husband forgets your birthday.  Do you divorce?  Not if he's good to you otherwise.  Do you burn his toast and over-salt his eggs for a few weeks?  (Consider this review very burnt toast and very, very salty eggs.)"
1,Sorry I bought this nit didn't find or recover much it took a lot of time to do it's thing and shows allot of useless icons that showed files but didn't recover any of them so kind of useless ...
0,"I purchased this and then spent 3 hours trying to get it installed and to work, all to no avail. To say this subscription implementation is flawed is an understatement. First there is no link after ordering to download any software, so after about 10 minutes I found a link on autodesk after signing in to my account that allowed me to do so. The first download file had a checksum error, so I had to download it again. The second was valid and I installed, but I had no product key. I checked my emailed order confirmation, and no keys, so again back to autodesk and another 10 minutes of browsing to find the keys. With the keys the installation seemed to go without error, but when I tried to run it the software would just pause on the loading screen and go no further. After several Force Quits and retries, including a reboot or two in between, the splash screen gave way to an &#34;unable to access Autodesk license server error screen&#34; which directed me to check my internet connection. Diagnostics proved my internet connection was fine, and some digging on the internet revealed an IP address for the license server which I confirmed I could telnet too, so the issue was definitively not my internet connection. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and same result. Browsed the Autodesk support forums and no solution. Tried to open a support request and the support request page directs you to an invalid URL on the Autodesk website that then redirects to a page about issues with their single sign on.<br /><br />I really wanted this to work on my Mac so I don't have to switch over to my old PC to use my now very dated version of AutoCAD, but this was nothing but a waste of several hours of a Saturday afternoon. Fortunately there is a 30 day trial and I will be getting a full refund. Hopefully if you buy this you experience a better result."
2,Basic SW OK but needed to upgrade to cover other needs. Dislike continuous prompts to upgrade to their more expensive packages.
4,"I have been using TurboTax for several years now. It makes putting together taxes a breeze. I used to do the state separately to avoid the additional cost, but its so time-effective to do them all together that I download this deluxe edition with the state every year.    Additionally, I love Amazon.com software download service. Perfect for people who don't want to store dozens of software boxes in a home with limited space!"
3,"For those of us who refuse to pay $100s for the MS Office suite, this is a good substitute.<br /><br />But, there are so many 'where is the ...' moments, that it does get tedious after a while, but that is what you give up when you pay $0.00 for something. I do not have time, but there are at least 100 things I would change. But maybe they have to make it different so it does not violate copyright laws.<br /><br />In any case, for the most part, it is a good product."
3,A bit more confusing than Turbo Tax but price is right.
3,"This years version is mostly trouble free - no crashes but if your are new to this product make sure you look at the forms as there can be incorrect entries from either the interview process or the easy step. Importing from Intuit's  Quicken product be very careful for schedule E,C when you print from quicken and you must verify the entries that import to Turbotax which loads different numbers. I eventually selected to enter myself from the quicken print copy. Still playing with the entries of business expenses as the interview and step by step placed incorrect entries in the form result was the same. It aggregated some of my expenses as other when there were actual lines the net effect was the same  but I was looking for accuracy.  I have been using this product for over a decade. Additional notes on TT -It has problems with K-1's - If you have values in lines 1,2,3 it says they are mutually exclusive. The work around is to enter the line 1 data as one K1 and line 2 as another k1,etc. Works out ok lists on schedule E and C correctly when you do this. TT needs to have a check box screen for the variations like do you have data in line 1,2,3  and than handle each one correctly. 1099-t does not ask about additional data to reconcile - it is one the form version . so if you have  no value in box 1 and have reconciliation data on the 1099-t enter on the form as the easy step does not ask."
0,"I was forced to rent office for the second month running because I needed to work on my resume and I was having problems using open office. I think to put it plainly, Microsoft are a greedy corporation. In the first place office should be part of the windows package but they have gotten away with selling it separately. Now they no longer sell it to you, they want you to rent it. I would now have to pay what it would have cost to own the software to just rent it for one year. I would cancel my subscription very soon, I am done with my resume writing."
1,"There were some glitches with this software, the main issue is I lost my internet connection because of this software.<br />A bit bloated also"
0,Could not download the software !!!
2,"There is a big learning curve with this product and I can't even figure out how to use all of the features. There really should be some type of training that comes along with it because if most people are like me they only use 10% of the features because they can't figure the rest out.<br /><br />I really only use the payroll feature and so far I've had no issues. I wanted to avoid paying a CPA to calculate my payroll taxes, and this product does eliminate that need.<br /><br />I may or may not renew the subscription at the end of the term. If I can find a payroll product that is cheaper, then I'll probably switch because I'm not in love with QuickBooks. Also, if you call the Customer Service department for help with the product they just try to upsell you to something else or a charge you to answer your questions, they aren't Customer Service, they are sales people."
1,It seemed to bring more problems than it solved.
3,Awesome program to get the work that my student do published ! Would recommend to any teacher that needs to convert files.
2,"I finally relented and bought Quicken 2013. I was hesitant after seeing the negative reviews. So far I have not had any issues with the software, everything has worked as described. However I am disappointed in the mobile applications. I was hoping for more information. I would love to be able to see my calender with all of my bills like I do on my desktop. This way I can pay bills if I am away from home and I know what is due when. As it is now all I can see on the mobile app is my current transactions and quicken balance. Sure I can add a transaction but unless I have a separate calendar set up on my phone with my bills I am not sure what I need to pay. I bought the software because I wanted the mobile functionality, but it is not adequate for what I need at this time. Other than that the interface is not any different than in the 2012 version. I give it 3 stars because it works but I feel like I wasted my money since it is not much different than before and the mobile apps do not provide enough functionality."
1,"If all you want is a simple register, then this is an over-priced, over-featured headache.  If you want the mobile app and other high-end capabilities, they don't work and Quicken has almost no customer support.  It took me three days to reach someone via the chat and then they still couldn't fix my problem."
4,I have used AVG for at least 4 years now and have nothing bad to say about it  Light weight  does not take over the system like others do and is easy to setup to do scans when  you want it too.  Just a great product
4,"This is actually for my Grandson who is 12 yrs old,<br />he plays a variety of instruments and is recording, he says he loves it!!!!"
3,"Excellent option, easy migration from Quicken 2014 - Windows version. I think needs improvements on the budget and some reports, also it is a disappointment not to have the free credit score (it is an option on the Windows 2015 version=  but overall it´s a very good tool, and finally for Mac. Try it.  Also you have the 60 days money back guarantee."
1,"Everytime I try to combine more than 4-6 pages in the pdf, it says it cant save the new pdf.  Frustrating....."
4,I've used turbo tax and this. This does exactly the same thing but doesn't cost nearly as much as turbo tax.
4,"The product downloaded very easily and I have peace of mind with another year of Norton Security protection and their exceptional support service, (which is unsurpassed from my experience with several Internet security providers). The standard Norton Security 2015 is remarkably similar to Norton 360 although without file backup. I simply installed a USB flash drive and now have my files being backed up automatically every week through Windows. A Norton representative graciously added the remaining 33 days on my current Norton 360 subscription to the new Norton Security 2015 upon request. I couldn't ask for more. As an added bonus, through Amazon's limited time offer, I was credited 15.00 on a different order I placed today just for purchasing Norton Security 2015 at an already low price. Now was the perfect time for me to upgrade my Norton security. Thank you Norton and Amazon!"
2,Needed to amend my state return and could not do it.  Also could not find any way to get any help.  Will not use turbo tax again.
3,"Good enough, I wish I could file it directly to my computer instead of putting it on social media only."
3,"make my filing a lot easier, especially on import and carry over features, have used this software since it became available long time ago."
0,"I've never seen anything as screwed up and frustrating as this product. In Intuits world $1.32 + $3.76 = $14,675,34. (Slightly exaggerated, but close. I know some of you know what I'm talking about) How they come up with their math is beyond me. Here's a good one; I spend all day creating and getting the numbers correct. (Mostly anyway). I backed up the current file, copied it to OneDrive, walked upstairs, restored it to my Surface Pro 2 running the same software and somehow during that time my bank account increased by $12,000+. Tried it one more time; this time I saved a copy of the file instead of backing up. Did the same process and now I'm -$601.15 in the hole. How in God's name does something like that happen? This isn't software. It's sillyware. Don't get me started on the retirement accounts. Don't be fooled but the name &#34;Quicken&#34;. This isn't it. You purchase this product and you will get burned."
0,"I am using Quicken 2007, version 16.2.0.  My OS system is Mac OS X Yosemite Version 10.10.1.<br />Is there another option for me to update my Quicken program as the Quicken 2015 did not work for me.<br />I could not get any of my 30 reports, could not create a report, could not do a Quick report etc.<br />Quicken 2015 is not one bit usable for my needs. Find it unbelievable that it was even released.<br />Hours of my time wasted.  Quicken for Mac 2015 is worthless."
4,In past years I would buy a TurboTax cd and load it onto my computer.  It is so much easier to buy the TurboTax that downloads to your computer!! Fabulous product.
1,"If you want to file a corporate return with Turbo Tax, you must use a Windows machine. I tried. I fired up an old Windows machine and installed it, gave it a whirl. The software is clumsy and outdated. I seriously hope Turbo Tax will offer corporate tax return software for Mac or even a web version. Why they cannot baffles me. Many customers are fleeing to competitors due to this. TaxAct offers a web version of their corporate tax return software, which plays nice with Mac or Chromebook or whatever. I've &#34;kicked the tires&#34; on it and so far I like it better than Turbo Tax, and it is much cheaper too. I don't want to the cheapest tax prep software, I want the best and easiest to use. Right now, Turbo Tax is lagging. It's 2015 and Intuit cannot offer this software for Mac or via the web? Is there some reason for this?"
1,Very Bad
4,"I have used Avast for years and have always been very pleased with it. Definitely good protection, especially for the price - Free!  It out performs the competition!"
1,"I've been a Quicken user since Quicken 98 and I was really happy years ago when Quicken automated downloading transactions directly from your financial institution.  Little did I realize how much of a slave this would make me later on.  I've upgraded over the the years, usually when Intuit forces me to every three years when they shut off downloads.  It must be nice to guarantee that every three years someone is going to have to buy your product.  After reading all the reviews for this new release I almost didn't do it.  I researched using Mint.com and while it's nice, it doesn't have some of the reporting and tracking features that Quicken does.<br /><br />I finally did and the transition has been smoother than expected, but not perfect. I gave it two stars because I only had to get in touch with Quicken support once.  It turned out I simply had to deactivate online updating and reactivate it on certain accounts that stopped updating in the new version.  A relatively simple fix on something that worked just fine in the previous version.<br /><br />One problem I've had with Quicken for years now is the recording and rounding of investments.  For some reason most of my financial companies download their stock quantities in six decimal places while they only track it in three.  Quicken wants to place everything in six decimal places which requires me to either correct the problem manually or do a balance update.  Then Quicken wants to throw in place holders, which throws rates of return, etc. off.  Funny, but Mint.com, which is free, doesn't have this problem.  Maybe Quicken could have a setting that lets it decide which piece of information it's going to use for rounding.<br /><br />There are some other \\""improvements\\"" that I'm not sure are better.  The new budget tool just seems to spread information out which requires scrolling to get from one month to the next where the old version had everything fit on one screen.<br /><br />If I didn't have to upgrade I probablywouldn't have.  Unfortunately, Intuit requires you to if you want to keep being able to download transactions.  I probably wouldn't mind so much if the program really seemed to get better rather than just more expensive."
3,"Loved having office for my mac.  As a long time PC user, i was so use to office, and found Mac version to not be very comparable to office.  One big con is that my Mac doesn't have a cd rom drive, so i had no choice but to get the downloaded version"
0,"Once you sign up for their service. If you want to cancel, they make it very very difficult to cancel it. I have cancelled my suscription however they keep charging my credit card because they say &#34;licenses&#34; are still active even though suscriptions were cancelled. You might think Microsoft is a serious company and you can trust them but these guys are worst than any unknown company that just wants to take advantage once they have your credit card information.<br />The customer support contact form is completely hidden, so customers cannot &#34;bother&#34; them."
3,Love the idea of giving me a warning for possible audit issue and max my deductions. It also explains all the tax terms that am not familiar with.
3,Not easy to edit a plan once created.
0,I CANT GET IN!!!!! Reset my password a dozen times and put key code in AND ITS DENYING ME EVERYTIME!!!.do not buy!!!!
1,If you used Quicien on the pc for years like I did the Mac version will be a dissappointment
0,"If I could just do a 1040A or EZ form, they are so easy to do it's not even worth getting software for it. Granted, you can e-file and get your refund back quicker, if you are due a refund, but I'll either find another product or go back to manually filing.<br /><br />  Glad other customers pointed this out, and I looked before I grabbed it off of a shelf somewhere."
0,"I've been a reluctant Quicken user for more than 10 years. Quicken has had the distinction of being the least worst in a field of unusually weak competitors. Quicken holds you hostage by shutting off your download capability if you don't pay for the upgrade every 3 years. They add insult to injury by forcing you to take an upgrade that is worse than the version you previously owned.<br /><br />I found Quicken 2014 (already on revision 6) to be a poorly written and poorly tested product. I struggled for hours to get this set up and found problems so obvious that I could not believe they were problems at all. It must be me.<br /><br />It didn't take too much research to find that not only were these real problems, but they had been there for the last several years and Quicken still had not resolved them. If you use the budgeting capabilities you would be well advised to consider the possibility that staying with your older version and manually entering your transactions could be less time consuming than struggling through the upgrade. In the end your upgrade may have poorer capabilities than what you're using."
2,It has become too complicated. Switched to Webroot.
2,"Does the job, but you have to be careful that it doesn't miss some items of deduction and/or taxable income. I switched to this after reading the awful reviews of Turbo Tax, which is what I used in the past 4 years. The software did pull up my Turbo Tax information from the prior year but it missed a couple items as I went through the program. Perhaps the program will automatically catch these things next year now that I've manually put them in this year."
1,"Severe installation challenges.  Once installed, the product tried to apply an update that failed and locked the application."
3,"This package has way more than I will ever need! The list of tools is impressive and since I've been a PSP user for several years it all seems very intuitive and easy to access. Now for the downside. I have a much older version (PaintShop Pro 7) which is still Windows 7 compatible  that I still prefer to use when I just need a few simple functions to get a quick job done. The reason I don't use X7 very often is it requires a large desktop space to spread out all of the tool bars and also to keep your main editing screen from shrinking to an unusable space!  I do must of my editing on a laptop with a 15\\"" screen. PSPX7 needs a LOT more real estate than that. I would think at least a 24\\"" screen would be best to take advantage of all of the neat features like the film strip style browser at the bottom of the screen and the many floating tool bars."
0,"Not worth the money- even at $29.99.  I upgraded from Quicken 2012, hoping that it would be less buggy and have some nice updated features and I honestly cannot tell the difference between the two- I have yet to find a feature or change between 2012 and the 2015 version.  Wish I had saved my money and stuck with the 2012 version, quirks and all.<br /><br />A few glitches as well when I loaded 2015:  it did install correctly, and import my quicken from my existing file, however, it did not download to the current release.  It was release 1 and apparently release 4 is the most current one.  It was not working properly at all, and after two rounds with customer service, I'm now on release 4- but again, notice no change from my 3 year old Quicken that I was using.<br /><br />The other major pain is when you are reconciling.  Watch the statement date you put in the reconciliation screen.  If you don't put in a date that is after the date you entered a transaction, that transaction won't even show up in the reconciliation screen- it is as if it does not exist. I think this an &#34;update&#34; for 2015 and  I find this a huge pain.  I know that I don't *always* get the exact date right (for budgeting purposes, as long as it is ballpark and in the same month, that is all that really matters) and I couldn't figure out why it wasn't showing in the reconciliation screen.<br /><br />All in all, if you already have quicken, I'd recommend you save your $ and buy something else.  This new version isn't going to gain you anything and will likely just cause you more headaches than what you have."
4,The ease of ordering on Amazon will take place yearly. The price was comparable. The protection provided for my computer is well worth the cost.
0,I have Snow Leopard on my mac.  I get an error message that says &#34;Unable to install&#34;
1,"I remember using the original version and it's first few successors, and they were useful. It's been a while since I used Quicken, so I bought the download version of Quicken Deluxe 2011 via Amazon. The download and install went fine, no issues. The setup was pretty much like I remember doing with the old versions, but it had a few new features added like auto downloads from accounts. Even that part went OK, and Quicken already had my credit union information (along with that of most major banks and credit unions).<br /><br />Now comes the attempts at using the program. I know that there are courses, and even \\""idiot books\\"" available for Quicken, but I didn't think I would need them just to use the basic features of the software. I just wanted to track basic checking and savings, credit cards, etc. and be able to see a clear picture of my money situation. The ability to update all accounts with one button seemed like it would be a nice improvement.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it hasn't turned out that way. There are now so many different views available, I couldn't even find the one I was trying to show off to my wife. Not a good start. So I began to look into all of the options, and try to get up to speed on it again. That's when I ran into an even larger problem. The automatic account updates sometimes seemed to work, other times they didn't appear to do anything. This despite getting a \\""success\\"" message after every update attempt. None of the accounts were balancing correctly. At first I figured I must have missed a step or something like that. After many attempts with mixed results, it just appears that I'm stuck with random outcomes. OK for some things, but family finances isn't one of them.<br /><br />When I went back and tried to manually balance the accounts, I found both double entries, and missing ones. I finally stopped trying to correct everything. Now I'm stuck in a kind of limbo, getting annoying prompts to allow Quicken to update accounts online at everylogon, and trying to decide whether I should just delete the entire thing, or start over. I'm thinking of either going back to just using a spreadsheet, or digging into the depths of my storage to find an old version of Quicken (on floppies?) and if needed, a floppy drive.<br /><br />If you are current on Quicken, you might not have any of these issues. If not, you may want to read an idiot book, or take a course first. Good luck."
1,"I use Publisher 2010 at work and really like it. It actually is a pretty intuitive program. I was hoping the new version would have some great updates. Little did I know that the blinding white workspace would deter me from wanting to find out what the program can do. You cannot customize the color/theme beyond some minor changes although I understand the other 2013 Office programs, such as Word and Excel, do allow two color changes. This appears to be a choice in Publisher but actually doesn't work. I would not have purchased the new version if I had seen the workspace. It may seem like a minor, cosmetic annoyance but it is really a nightmare. Whoever approved this design is an idiot."
3,Overall Quicken Rental Property Manager 2015 is a good product but there are some quirks that make it difficult to use. Quicken has a heck of a time connecting to banks online. The program often freezes up and becomes non-responsive when attempting to make a connection. That's frustrating.<br /><br />I really like the ability to forecast income and expenses and how you can separate out rental property items.
0,"I got this when I could not find my copy of word 2003 and needed a word processing program.<br /><br />Needless to say, it was more trouble then it is worth!"
1,"Been using Quicken for 20 years. Just installed the 2013 version and like a few others when first released, it's a memory hog. It updates data after every entry when reconciling, significantly slowing the process. Today when I tried to do a backup I ended up having to shut my computer off with the on/off button on the computer itself to get control back.  They usually get it right after a couple of updates. If you've never used Quicken or you're thinking of upgrading, WAIT! (actually at this point it's not an \\""upgrade\\"", just a newer version) The developers of this program also like to mess with users by changing things that were good the way they were and this version is no exception."
3,"I haven't had any real problems while using Norton.  I like the fact it scans facebook, emails and the internet."
1,With all the cost associated with the program next year I will just go to H&R Block and let someones else do it and pay 1 fee ... after the purchase of the program and the other cost that they hit you with to efile just as expensive to let someone else do it for you !
1,"I have been using the previous version of this Nuance product (Pro 8). It was okay, maybe a three and a half star. Of course I have only Adobe Acrobat  PDF 11 to compare it to. But this version I have nicknamed &#34;JunkWare.&#34; They've adopted the Microsoft Ribbon but lost the ease of locating tools while doing so. They overwrote my previous verision so I'll have to uninstall this one and see if the former version will re-install. And my opinion is not,based on having to change course with the new visuals, in other words it's not because it's new to me. That's not a bother. What I don't care about with a lot of today's latest software is that they have found a way to increase the number of mouse clicks needed to get a simple task done. Shame on them all. Add that and the &#34;need&#34; to meet smaller phone requirements and desktops get second position with the designers. Sorry Nuance, but this is indeed, a poor effort. I would say you've created a ten-buck software."
4,"I absolutely love Norton for its ability to keep my computer virus and malware free and have used it for many years.  However, I found this version to be a bit cumbersome when installing.  I had to go to Amazon’s site for the product key, and then go to the Norton site to download; all without clear, concise instructions.  Once I got started the install went quickly with only one restart of the computer.  The install kept all of my old settings and I was up and running without issue quicker than most of the other installs I have done in the past.  This version seems to require less processing power and overhead on the computer, which is always a good thing.  All in all, except for the initial confusion, I think Norton has done a much better job than in the past."
0,"In an era where downloads and installations are so automated, I wasted my money on this software.  I downloaded it two hours ago.  I can see the software in a sub-directory, but there is absolutely no indication of how to install it.  I can't comment on the software, but don't consider buying it from Amazon, if you expect the installation to be easy.  I have the product key all ready to go, and nowhere to enter it."
2,Trying to get used to its differences from 2012 version.
4,"I have used Avast Antivirus for over six years now and it works great.  It updates regularly and the price is right, it is free.  A friend who works on computers recommended this and used it on his own systems recommended this to me and I appreciate his recommendation.  Make sure you remove other anti virus programs if you use this or any other antivirus as two programs on the same system will conflict."
0,File wouldn't open.  :~(
4,"Easiest to use tax software on the market today ! Easy to download & process !<br />I have used the H & R Block software for many, many years & never had a problem."
0,"I purchased a download of Quiken Deluxe 2014 after I upgraded my system from XP to windows 7.  It would not import any of the backup files from my Quicken 2000. I attempted to follow their instructions to download quicken 2004, covert my files and then down load and reinstall the Quicken 2014.  Did not work.  I can't understand that an organization that creates a program does not remember every file structure in order to insure the smooth upgrade path.  They have the file, they have the programs and they have the file structure for each edition.  In a way this reminds me of the built in obsolescence of the American auto industry prior to the 70's that was almost destroyed by the quality of the imported vehicles."
0,Don't just assume that just because you check to make sure your computer is compatible that it will be.  I checked installed this and it don't work.  It shows half the game so impossible to play.  Then I realize it says no returns so do yourself a favor and don't waste hard earned money on this mess.
0,"Had to buy 2013 after I already purchased 2014.  The 2014 software kept booting me out every time I opened a checking account. They said fix was coming, but who can wait for that."
3,"for being free, it's limited uses, it's not that bad but better than the others - if upgrading means no more yearly renewal or fees, it's worth it"
0,I have been using CAD for around 20+ years ... from very costly to freeware.<br />much for my own building use and from where I worked designing HVAC systems.<br /><br />if I could read german I might (MIGHT) have been able to get some use from this<br />program.  when I tried the standard commands I got nothing. when I did get a few walls set<br />I could not get a door to swing the right way. then when I tried to measure a wall<br />I lost all I worked on !<br /><br />I feel that a freeware program is far seperior in everyway .  or I could draw my plan<br />on a napkin with crayon and try to get a permit from that.<br /><br />Martin Harris
1,"I like some of the features of Elements 11, like the face recognition.  But, I couldn't figure out how to make a slideshow movie after hours of trying."
0,Screwed up computer. Froze cursor.
2,I don't like trying to resolve blue pencil items. It makes no sense. It came as a total surprise having used this product for at least ten years.
3,"I had Norton before and this is just a re-up. If I didn't care for it, I wouldn't be using it."
2,"I'm surprised that there are not more programs designed for the creation of a comic book.  This program is really designed for kids, not true artist or comic book creators... but it is easy to use and has a couple features that make it worthwhile for using to make comic books.  I can't complain too much about it as it was a great price, it does some of what I needed it to do with layouts and text bubbles, but it is really intended to be for children."
3,I have been a TurboTax user since 2006 and have been very satisfied.  I have used both the Deluxe and Premier editions.  In recent years I have used the Premier edition so the changes will not have an impact on me.  I have found it to very user friendly and accurate.  I have found the on-line customer support page to be helpful when I am unsure about any issue.  One of the features that I have found to be especially helpful is &#34;ItsDeductible&#34;  software on the WEB.  It allows me to put in all of my deductible contributions and then download the info to TurboTax.  I have been very satisfied and will continue to use the TurboTax software.
0,Horrible that they removed key forms. I hope they include them next year or I am changing tax software thereafter.
3,Very easy to down load. Program was easy to follow..
3,Love it.
0,What a bunch of garbage ... doesn't work with Windows 64 bit encryption to create invoices. Budgeting tool is time consuming and a waste of time. Someday they will stop riding on their name and produce a product that is customer centric!<br /><br />Stick with the old version ... that is till they force you to upgrade because of some bogus technicality ...
2,Ok
0,I was very disapoointed with this product.  Within a week my entire computer crashed with the new Norton installed.  I tried to download the product to 2 other devices and was no successful to this day in doing so.  I am not going to us Norton again.  After repair man services my computer and after $140 additional he told me that I don't even need Norton.
1,"I found it difficult to maneuver and follow through, and it was too expensive for my rather simple return.  Next time I'll try another plan."
1,"I have been using Quicken for over 15 years and as I have upgraded there has been some learning curve.  However, when I was forced to upgrade from Quicken 2011 to keep my banking download features, the useful features had all changed.  Budgeting, quick view reports, adding extra and unecessary fields in account registers have made the learning curve extra long.  I am trying to figure out how to make the software more useful and that I was familiar with.  The budgeting feature so far is useless.  In summary, over the next year I will be looking for an alternative way to manage my finances and investments."
4,I have never had a virus issue on my computer and it only comes up when there is a legitimate issue. That what I want from an antivirus software and avast! does just that.
2,"Great at catching viruses, tracking cookies, etc and a very good price.  But it definitely SSSLLLOOOOOOWWWWWWWSSS the computer down, sometimes to a crawl."
2,"The trial worked great, so I purchased the software. Unfortunately, I also deleted the trial before I installed the full version. It never would install, since the installer kept saying I had already installed it. I went through a dozen emails with their company wanting me to run software, edit Corel out of my registry, even create a new user on my computer. Nothing worked.<br /><br />Best advice: If you like the trial and buy the version, just input the serial number into your trial. DO NOT DELETE AND REINSTALL THE FULL VERSION.<br /><br />By the way, their customer service is quick to respond but will close out a ticket if you don't get back to them in a day or so."
1,"Up until purchasing this product, I have been using Quicken almost every day for about ten several years, for my personal finances.  My last stable version was 2013.  As soon as I installed this version, I found the user interface to be fairly unresponsive.  Copy and Paste Transactions rarely worked, and several other mouse and keyboard actions just never seemed to 'click' correctly.  Also, Intuit added a new column (I think called Amount) that appeared by default on every account, and you had to turn it off separately in every account.  I tried to use it for two weeks, but got so frustrated I finally returned it and reverted back to 2013.  (Caution - unless you figure out how to export your data properly, you will lose any recent work since upgrading because the data file structures are not backwards compatible.  Customer support on this topic is marginal at best.)"
1,It does work for all videos and this disappointing and frustrating
4,"am using norton since many years and I love the menue and how easy it is to change security levels. will buy the next version for sure. Be aware that it is usually cheaper to buy every year a new product, then to buy an update for the software you already have installed."
2,"Just so you know what to expect...<br /><br />I bought and downloaded this today 2/28/2013. Here's how it went.<br /><br />Step 1. download the Amazon Downloader, 4MB<br /><br />Step 2. Use the Amazon Downloader to download the OUT OF DATE Turbotax software, but only 87MB  (couldn't Amazon have done better here?)<br /><br />Step 3. Use the downloaded TurboTax software to download the latest version of TurboTax 2012, uh... that's another 92MB<br /><br />Step 4. The application will begin to download \\""federal updates\\"" (no progress bar so I don't know how many MB this was)<br /><br />So have that large bowl of popcorn and beer handy and don't have your heart set on getting your taxes finished up tonight."
2,Not that much difference from the past product.
2,"Didn't work at first, had to adjust it; then it worked perfectly."
2,This was not ready for prime time when released. I have used quicken sine 1998 and would have gone back to Quicken 13 if I could have. Eventually the issues went away. I will not update to Quicken 15 next year until it is out for at least 3-4months.
1,"This antivirus software did nothing to fix the problem. I figured for $20 I would take a gamble, but it has not helped one bit."
3,Worked as expected!
2,"I purchased the software to have Blu-ray support via Windows Media Center.  The ad for the software stated that it has this capability, but I haven't found that it does."
1,"It has all the bells and whistles you would come to expect from MS Word, however I hate the fact that it will not allow me to access documents on my computer unless I constantly log into Microsoft online every time I turn on my computer. Very annoying. I will be looking for a different program."
1,So far struggling with this software. Import from Quicken Essentials does not move scheduled transactions and process of scheduling with iBank is cumbersome and buggy. Does not sync with BOA account but have successfully synced others.  Considered getting refund but 90 day trial is only good if you purchase it directly from the company. Amazon gives no refunds for software purchases so I am out of luck in that regard. I will try to keep working it and hopefully have success. Will post update.
2,"I find the print difficult to see.  If I enlarge the font, then additional menus are bigger than the screen and I cannot close the item.  I would  like to be able to print with gridlines.  I had to change because I bought a new computer with windows 8 and was told I had to buy15 as my 13 program  is not compatable.  I also don;'t like the way bills are displayed."
3,Works well except already needs a patch like all computer items it seems. Still having trouble setting up the patch download after many attempts. Had an older version and I like some of the organizational items better then my older version. Needed to update due to laptop doesn't have a DVD/CD drive.
3,Works good still
0,"If you own and use Quicken 2007--- then don't convert. Quicken for 2015 is a major step down from the 2007 version. It is far less functional, far less intuitive and thus far less useful. Utterly mystifying why or how Quicken would release a new product that is vastly inferior to its past product."
3,It's awesome
3,I bought this because of previous positive experience w/ product. It seems to work fine. No problems installing. I would buy again.
2,"It has now been 20 days since I paid for a full year of CC, and the account, (which I now definitely want to cancel), is still not even accessible.  <br /><br />From my end it appears the Adobe employee I was on the phone with mistakenly miskeyed the primary email address when creating the account. So, when I try to log in with the correct .edu email it does not exist in their system. There is no way to know what email was entered by the employee, and so I still cannot access the services for which I paid in full in advance.  <br /><br />Even with a scan of my receipt, the original activation number, and my credit card on file, Adobe has no response. You'd think they would at least acknowledge that the current account isn't working, but even that seems to be beyond their ability to \\""support\\"". Over the last twenty days I have had to call Adobe over ten times, for over 5 hours, and have never received so much as a single email (let alone phone call) about the status of this case. After the case was \\""escalated\\"" multiple times its now the twelfth business day since a refund was promised by a floor supervisor in support. In addition, I still have not received the third promised return phone call from a support floor supervisor \\""looking into the case\\"".<br /><br />This is pathetic, a waste of my time, and a real concern for future use of cloud based services. If I didn't have some of these programs on disc I would soon have to go buy software, or buy ANOTHER cloud account while I waited for Adobe.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />After I wrote this review on Amazon Adobe communicated with me quickly, established what happened, and are processing a refund. It's interesting to note that not one \\""support\\"" supervisor ever got back to me, but I appreciate the efficiency with which they handled the case once it had the attention of someone with decision making authority.<br /><br />I hope Adobe pays attention to the flaws in its support and works hard to improve it."
2,"I decided to switch to H&R Block from TurboTax because of all the poor reviews. The tax software itself is easy to use, but with TurboTax I relied on ItsDeductible to figure out my charitable donations and H&R Block's version is paltry at best. Not nearly enough items to choose from and it was a PITA. I'll likely be going back to TurboTax next year."
3,Turbo Tax is good now but it was better when you could download it on more than one computer. I like to use my desktop sometime and my laptop at other times.
2,Program functions as expected.  It is now too expensive. I will use a different program for the 2015 return due to cost.
2,"Acrobat is one of those software programs you HAVE to have for certain industries and jobs.  The functionality is great.  I can do my OCR, edit and comment on PDFs, etc...<br /><br />But the User Interface Design is absolutely terrible!  Example - you want to OCR some files?  You have to open up a PDF first.  Any PDF - doesn't matter which.  Then, when you click OCR multiple files, the PDF file you have open isn't on the default list of PDFs to OCR.  Did I mention you can't OCR multiple files without first opening a file?  Dumbest UI design ever."
1,"Ahh... Another year, another version of Quicken. Another round of hopes and expectations (better budgeting? better UI? fewer crashes? Mint.com integration?) only to be dashed by yet another coat of lipstick on a certain specimen of Artiodactyla. But more on this below.<br /><br />TL;DR: no, you don't need to upgrade, unless your version is clearly inferior in performance or features (my previous Quicken version \\""magically\\"" stopped downloading transactions from my bank and I took a chance to see if this worked with the new version. It did). You will be getting the same Quicken you've seen over the last 6-8 years, only with new number on the logo picture and a mobile client.<br /><br />First things first: this time Intuit actually managed to introduce a \\""feature\\"" so bad, it is universally abhorred. I'm talking about balloon pop-ups. Want to confirm a newly downloaded transaction? You better have really good mouse handling reflexes (some experience with online FPS games might come handy). If you linger for more than a half a second on any of the fields in the register, a pop-up will spring up, showing pretty much the same details about the transactions you already see in the register anyway. This pop-up will \\""freeze\\"" the UI for about 2-3 seconds. Same goes for changing the record detail. Same with changing the status. And of course, as it always is with such brilliant innovations, there is no way to turn it off.<br /><br />Back to the big picture: in the best Quicken tradition, innovation means updating the logo with the new 2014 year and throwing in \\""new features\\"" that are as innovative as different brands of toilet paper. You typically get an all-around exciting features like \\""ability to attach images of receipts to transactions\\"" and \\""new and improved budgeting.\\"" and that's about it. Surely, this time around there is a mobile client, but it is hardly the biggest thing the product lacked.<br /><br />The UI is still the same, and that is not a compliment. Quicken's UI violates most common sense rules we've come to accept with Windows-based programs. Arrow keys behave differently. Control-A doesn't select all editable text. Esc doesn't dismiss pop-up windows. I can go on and on. Granted, a big part of this idiosyncratic behavior is for backward compatibility with ancient versions of the product, but the problem of handling different UI behaviors was solved many times over (WordStar, anyone?) and nothing prevents (from a technical standpoint) Intuit from updating UI to conform to Windows guidelines and have the \\""traditional\\"" behavior switchable as an option.<br /><br />Investment accounts are still a major pain to deal with. I mean, somehow Quicken thinks that as an investor, when I navigate to an account, the very first thing I want to see is the list of transactions. Not the holdings (must click on a button to see it and then click again to dismiss - did I mention that Esc key is overrated?), not the account performance - the transactions. And woe to you if you happen to have two different accounts backed by the same financial organization (in my case, 529 accounts are backed by Vanguard, where I also have a \\""regular\\"" account) - chances are, only one of these accounts will be able to download transactions because Quicken has a notion of \\""one org, one set of credentials.\\""<br /><br />Report engine is still untouched. Which means your choice of presentation is limited to \\""do you want a pie chart with your order?\\""  Forget about showing trends or suppressing non-trending categories, or sparklines or any other things that happened to data presentation over the last 15 years. I'm not even talking about such excesses as scheduled reports highlighting weekly or  monthly trends.<br /><br />The product is still in the age of one PC per household. Of course, I can install Quicken on all of my laptops and desktops but the concept of hosting the Quicken data file on a shared drive is still a non-starter: there are no guarantees it won't get corrupted and with my financial history I'm not too adventurous to try.<br /><br />The budget system is still too convoluted for its own good. I can [possibly] handle rather complex budget requirements but having something as simple and useful as setting monthly spending limits on categories and showing how close I am to that limit when I add or edit a transaction (something Microsoft Money was doing more than 10 years ago) is not available. Neither are scheduled security purchasing transactions (also something Money did well for many years).<br /><br />When Intuit acquired Mint.com and its founder became head of the Quicken product, there was a lot of excitement and hope for innovation. 4 years have passed and none of that materialized. Quicken and Mint are still separate, completely disconnected worlds. Quicken changes from release to release are laughable; it still relies on bleeding its customers with mandatory upgrades  every 3 years (if they use online transactions). Overall, the product is stuck in an un-virtuous cycle, where lack of innovation results in lack of interest, which in turn translates to mediocre revenue and thus in less potential to innovate. Granted, there are several new players on the market, so not all hope is lost and I really hope that someone, someday comes up with a product that is truly innovative and makes using it easy, fun, and helpful.rrupted and with my financial history I'm not too adventurous to try.<br /><br />The budget system is still too convoluted for its own good.

4,"Taxes were easy again this year with turbo tax! I saw no major difference from this year to last, and just received my refund this morning! Many people mentioned that there was going to be a delay this year, but it seemed to me that everything worked as quickly as last year. Note: I did not have any government health care to consider."
3,"Not a bad plays Blu-ray player, disc play without any problem and software updates regularly. As long as you know what you are buying everything is perfect.<br /><br />You have to remember, this is a very vanilla player and its main purpose is to play the disc contents period. It will not show any fancy designed main menu, but a very simple list like &#34;Play Movie, Chapter, Audio, subtitle, other titles.<br /><br />In Chapter and Other Titles only a list of time keys, no motion or still preview nothing.<br /><br />Over all personally I like it, because it serve its only purpose -to play the movies."
0,"Can some VC in the bay area seriously re-group the Intuit development team from the mid 90's and develop a competing product from scratch? If v1.0 even showed a little promise they would not have to spend a dime on marketing. Word of mouth would be insane.<br /><br />Those of us using Quicken and QuickBooks have spent so much time \\""tricking\\"" the software these last 10 years to make it do SIMPLE things! In many cases, SIMPLE things it USED TO DO! Don't even get me started on the MAC version of the software which I used temporarily...Intuit obviously thinks MAC owners must be too stupid to want a report of any kind...instead giving you a pretty spending cloud...I mean, why worry your little creative head with a list of numbers, right?<br /><br />The current development team at Intuit is either incredibly stupid, managed by an idiot or both.<br /><br />We are all tired of having our severely lowered expectations not met.<br /><br />Someone, anyone, save us from Intuit...<br /><br />This new product, FAIL!"
2,"a very underpowered version of PhotoShop... but useful for smell corrections etc.  Not the best value for money, though"
2,"I just downloaded and installed H&R Block At Home Basic 2011. The software works fine as in previous years. However, the videos that are supposed to explain tax law changes (for example: \\""What's new for 2011\\"") are 2010 versions (dated Dec 16, 2010). That might mislead unsuspecting viewers because some of those credits for 2010 are no longer available for 2011."
0,"This is the first year I have tried the H&R Block program.  I was tired of the Intuit games with their TurboTax program - in all the years I used TurboTax, I NEVER received a promised rebate and the State filing fees were getting out of hand.  There were other unexpected charges too, but this review isn't the forum for that.    I decided to try H&R Block's software for a change even though I liked TurboTax.  H&R Block was much easier to use for those who enjoy the step-by-step walk-through.  In many ways, the explanation of the tax codes for decision points people reached were very easy to understand.  It even took the TurboTax files form the previous year and flawlessly transferred the data to H&R Block's software for this year's return.    The one major flaw in this software is when one makes an itemized list for a field, the list can not be edited or even reopened once closed.  Every time I tried to bring up an itemized list from any field, the program would crash with the dreaded \\""H&R Block quit unexpectedly\\"" error.  All data entered after the previous save was lost.  This was very frustrating as there is no way to edit an itemized list once added.  This was an every time event - no matter which field I entered an itemized list for - I even started an entirely new return to see if that would fix it.  It didn't.  I then went to the web site and found no way to provide feedback on the issue.  There was no support area for this either.  The only support areas were for tax questions and installation issues.  I had to revert to using Excel for my itemized lists to add things up before entering the final number in the proper tax field.  This software bug cost H&R Block two stars.  Other than that, it appeared to be a good software package - on par with TurboTax but without the Intuit hidden cost issues.    Jim    Update: Attempted to access the forms directly.  I opened the 1040 with no problem, but when I tried to access a link to another form, the wrong form kept popping up (tried to access Form 8863 (American Opportunity Credit) and instead it opened Form 8812 (Additional Child Tax Credit).  And when a field is selected, the form jumps around.  H&R Block sent me a link to a new, improved version.  All the same issues remained in the newest version.  Lowered to Two Stars.    Update 2: Decided I had enough of the buggy program and wanted to return it.  Found the 60-day guarantee, but no way to submit for it.  Called H&R Block to obtain a refund.  After about 20 minutes of looking on their database, the customer service representative said she could find no way to refund the money and that I needed to contact Amazon for the refund, but Amazon won't refund on a downloaded piece of software.  After 40 minutes on the phone, information was taken and H&R Block said they would elevate it to the next level.  I am now waiting for a phone call back.  Although very nice on the phone, the H&R Rep was clueless.  Rating now one-star - wish there was a zero star rating."

4,"Avast! is a great antivirus software for most people.  As opposed to the antivirus most computers come with, it doesn't spider its way into your computer and make it nearly impossible to remove.  The user can chose if the software auto-updates or not.  The other side of the coin is that it is free, so people who are paranoid about anything ever going wrong should pay for a much more complete system of antivirus, spyware, malware protection.  Most people will find this more than adequate, and I suggest it to all my friends as soon as they get a new computer.  Being able to do a direct scan of any individual file is helpful, particularly if a file seems foreign or sketchy.  It also tends to be less forceful and aggressive about the user giving it attention than the antivirus that comes standard on most computers."
4,"I have used Intuit Payroll since I started using QuickBooks - probably since 1995.  Prior to that everything was processed by hand.  Our company has gone from about 30 employees to 60+ and now back to 17+.  Through all these changes Intuit has been there for me, helping to guide me through all areas of HR."
1,"I have bought and successfully used Turbo basic for years.  Since I have no state tax here in FL, I'm too frugal (read cheap) to buy one of the versions that include the state tax part.  I can handle my small portfolio easiy on the BASIC version. I don't even mind, too much, all the embedded attempts to get me to upgrade. My beef with the download version was partially my fault.  I had something running on my laptop so I just downloaded to my other computer, thinking I could easily move it over later.  Whether it is a difference in operating systems, my lack of expert skills or Intuit's desire not to let you use the advertised 5 returns on two machines --- I have been unable to move in any of the three ways I tried. I've tried sharing the progam with wi-fi, moving it on a flash drive and using a backup facility.  No luck. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and didn't rate it \\""I hate it\\"" because it works ok -- just can't be moved. I'm guessing it can't be backed-up to protect against a hardware or software failure.  I wrote Intuit about this and after two weeks don't expect one."
4,Use every year
2,I've used Turbo Tax for a few years and it's straight forward and easy to use.  This year's edition was more expensive and included an increased price for state Efile.  Good luck trying to find the price of the state Efile before purchasing Turbo Tax.  I couldn't tell that anything was improved over last year so it may be worth paying someone to do my taxes next year instead of spending my own time doing them with TurboTax.
3,I especially like the Templates. I use about 15 of them on a regular basis. All provide a professional look.
2,I was basically forced to upgrade if I wanted to keep using the services.  This version isn't very different from the 2012 I was using.  One thing that could still use improvement is the &#34;match downloads&#34;.<br />Overall it is still the one of the best (and one of only a small handful) of personal money managing software on the market.  There isn't much competition.  That's probably why they can get away with it.  I'll continue to use until something better comes along.
2,EDIT: The constant begging they do to upgrade to the paid version became so overbearing that I removed this app from ALL of my devices! I no longer use this for any of my devices. Great job ruining a great product you had.  OLD REVIEW: I know that they are trying to support what they are doing but way too many pop up ads in the task bar. Even the ad to rate this thing comes up everytime I turn on my laptop so they win because I am doing this so I don't see that ad again. I better not see it again. lol. It seems to work tho and its free so I cannot argue with that. I will say I have not had a virus since I have been using this but I am not a novice to the internet what I should and shouldn't click on if you know what I mean. Take it for what you will. If you don't want ads you can pay for your antivirus. If you want a firewall you can pay for that too. I have 3 PC's and a laptop and I use this on all my machines and my family's machines I am forced to reformat when they mess them up. I use it for my phone/tablet too.
1,"Created slower responds, had to remove it to get system speed back up."
3,"Not perfect but really the only option for tracking personal finances. The Mobile app companion to it is still needing a ton of polish, but you don't need to use it if you don't wish to. Gets updates from my banks automatically which is a plus. Has a lot of good features especially when tracking investments. Still seems lacking in areas. Considering there is no real competitor this is your best option. There is Mint.com but it is owned by Intuit as well so you are basically getting Quicken lite when using Mint."
2,"low price is the best point.  Fortunately I have a degree in accounting  and can overcome the short falls of the program, for very simple returns it is fine but pretty weak."
4,"When I bought this software there were only two reviews posted.  Both were 5 stars.  Both said that this was an easy program to use--and that they had great support.<br /><br />Once I had tried the program, I posted a review saying that the program had potential--but that it wasn't easy to use.<br /><br />I have now used the program for a few days--and have used their email support once.  I now believe that the program is probably as easy to use as it can be for the complex tasks that it is designed to perform.<br /><br />I would have found it easier to use if it had provided more complete documentation.  Initially, I failed to find their downloadable documentation (available at [...])--so I was relying on their help menus.  Their documentation is basically their help menus in PDF form.  Some of it is good, but some of it is woefully inadequate--the section on passwords, for instance.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out how to embed my username and password into their program so it could check my password protected files and folders on my very large web site (more than 2000 pages).  I read their documentation and tried to use their password wizard.  Nothing worked.<br /><br />Finally, I broke down and went to their site where there is a form that allows the user to send an email to their support people.  I received a reply within two hours.  The tech support person had gone to my site and had determined the type of password protection that it uses.  He then tailored his step-by-step instructions to provide exactly the solution that I needed.  GREAT JOB!  THANKS!<br /><br />The Insite program has identified thousands of broken links on my site, and I am now in the process of correcting those.  I created the problem over a period of years by moving pages and trusting my DreamWeaver program to update the links.  DreamWeaver sort of did that--but not especially well.  Now, for the first time, I realize what a mess I had created.<br /><br />The Insite program has helped me to identify broken links that I never would have found on my own.  As one example, I have links from my name to a Bio that tells who I am.  When Insite identified the broken links, I went to the problem pages, tried the links, and found that they worked.  What's the problem!  Why did Insite say that I had a broken link?<br /><br />But then I went to the code and found that DreamWeaver had created a new link (which worked), but had left the old link (which didn't work) in the code.  That broken link would be invisible to the typical user, who would click on the link and go to my Bio.<br /><br />BUT I believe that Google will see those broken links (just as the Insite program did)--and will conclude that my site isn't well maintained--and will decide that I should be penalized in their search results as a consequence.  That's a big time problem for me--and I need to get it fixed.<br /><br />I am still using Insite at a very basic level, but that is sufficient to help me correct thousands of broken links.  As time passes, I hope to get more Insite savvy.  The facts that I am making so much progress in cleaning up my web site--and that I received such a helpful answer from their tech support--makes me grateful to Inspyder for their Insite program and support.n my own.

3,"it has slowed down my 3 PC, even a high performance gaming PC"
3,"I am not sure what all of the complaining is about.  It installed easily.  It moved all of my data from Essentials perfectly, and worked right out of the shoot.  I then installed the app on my iphone.  That worked great.  A few hours later, I looked at m my ipad, and the app was already there.  I logged in, and it worked perfectly again.  Once you get used to the different look of the new product, hopefully you will be as pleased with the upgrade as I was"
2,"Two things here. Just got a MAC, so there is a learning curve here. Secondly, I have been using a PC with Quicken H&B 2011. There is no H&B for a MAC. There are many features that are different that I am still trying to find...not sure that they are really there. Still looking. That being said, 2011 H&B was great. Hopefully, 2015 for MAC will be just as good...as soon as I learn how to use it and the MAC.<br />By the way, Quicken did a great job in converting the PC files to MAC \\""language.\\"""
2,"My six year old son was bored with this in less than half an hour. He wanted to keep practicing and improving but because he didn't reach a certain proficiency level, the game wouldn't let him progress. It tried to make him do the same letters over and over again, and that's no fun for anyone. Disappointed."
1,"I have used Turbotax for the past two years and decided to switch to Tax Cut this year after reading all the reviews by upset Turbotax users that Intuit raised their prices. Having used both programs now, I have to say that Turbotax is worth the extra $. Being able to import W2s, bank statements, and eTrade statements is a huge time saver. Turbotax also does little things like automatically inserting values that it already has from past year's returns (Tax Cut does some of this but there are little annoying areas that didn't bring the info forward when I know I input the information earlier). To be fair, both get the job done but Tax Cut took me significantly longer to step through and was not the stress-free tax prep experience that I have had with Turbotax. Also, as mentioned in other reviews, this \\""+State\\"" version of Tax Cut still charges $19.95 for a State eFile ... very misleading. Bottom line is, I'm going back to Turbotax next year."
2,"Turbo tax is really easy and convenient to use. However, there are two major bugs for 2008 edition which you need to be aware of.  Especially if you're a homeowner/renter and had received any homestead rebate in 2008.  First, if you're a renter and trying to get tax deduction or credit, program defaults you to homeowner. There are no options to input the amount of rent you paid or anything. This is a bug that multiple people had already notified Turbo tax about but it's still not fixed.   Second if you had a homestead tax rebate from your state for 2008 (I filed for NJ resident and NY non-resident), you cannot for the life of god make it count as taxable income unless you had filed for 2007 with online version of TT as well. The reason is that program assumes you had not itemized your deductions in 2007 if it has no online data for your previous tax year. I had itemized my deductions previous year, but TT has no options for you to change it. So you have a grand option of a)speaking for an hour with TT tech rep and trying to transfer your offline returns to online b)filing it wrongly and then correcting form on your state return yourself c) skipping the filing with Turbo Tax this year altogether.     I think I will go with option C. Which is sad, because I really liked the program. I started with online deluxe version but will probably not choose to file with it. I rather pay [...] to my local accountant than deal with headache of calling my state tax authorities and straightening all the mess created by multiple bugs in program."
0,"I ordered this directly from the software company and may request my money back. Per the description here and on their site:<br /><br />\\""Direct export of multimedia slideshows as Media Players (Flash technology) for convenient viewing on your PC through an Internet browser and for embedding in websites (export includes HTML source code).\\""<br /><br />I am a web designer and always looking for ways to make my job easier and that line is exactly why I purchased this program. I found out (because it's not properly disclosed unless you read through all their other marketing material -- it's not on the comparison PDF on their site and who has time for that and why would anyone expect to have to pay more?) that you have to purchase the CODEC separately for £9.99 for HTML output.<br /><br />In essence, this product is a scaled down version of Corel's  VideoStudio Pro X5 (I have the Ultimate version). This is a redundant piece of software for me so it's a waste of my money.<br /><br />So, for full disclosure here, if you want to have a program that will output for HMTL (websites) you will have to pay more in order to do that. If you want more features for video and slideshows than this product offers, I recommend [[ASIN:B007GFNPFY VideoStudio Pro X5 Ultimate]].<br /><br />EDIT: I bit the bullet and bought the CODEC for this program. Let's just say, it's worthless. It has no features for HTML output to put up a slideshow that would be a bit more interactive, no features to create a slideshow that might blend better with your site - in short not worth the time or the effort for anyone looking to incorporate into a website. The $12.82 in US I spent EXTRA on this program upsets me greatly. IMO, they misrepresented their product by not being up front about having to buy the CODEC by noting it here and on their website in plain site for all to see...and would not recommend this to anyone."
2,"its in header thats all i can type since i have trouble with typing.., if this is not enough you will have to wait umntil i rest"
2,"I love this program, but what a pain to get it downloaded.  I keep getting error messages, even after trying 3 different browsers.  I left a message for office.com support for a call back. They said waiting time is about 20 minutes, but it's been an hour.  Get the actual software to install on the computer."
3,"I don't really know what to say other than it is Quickbooks.  I actually purchased it mistakenly, as I use Accountants version of QB and this is not.  So, I am personally still on QB for Accountants 2013 and my clients are on 2014.  I did have a big QB bug after installing where I was unable to export payroll to Excel without getting a password box that cannot be gotten rid of without completely shutting down.  I no longer export payroll to excel with my 2014 to avoid that.  Kind of a pain, but I just work around it."
3,Avast is easy to use and has protected my computer with very little effort from me. I would recommend it to others.
1,"I have been a quicken user also from day one.  I always upgrade.  But this upgrade needs work. The program has some nice features but is not a dynamic upgrade. Further, if you the mobile app, they have not corrected the double entry at download issue. This issue has been known for some time, and is yet to be corrected. This upgrade can be skipped, unless you just want to upgrade because it is new."
3,The delivery took place at the appointed time. The product is exactly as announced by the seller. I am very satisfied with the purchase.
4,I have used Quicken for years (2003).  The new reversion has so many more offerings.  I am still in the process of learning more about Quicken 2014.  Thank You
1,"I have been using Microsoft Money for years flawlessly. Unfortunately, it is not supported anymore. My husband suggested I make the switch over to Quicken. I downloaded and imported my money file over and that worked correctly. Every time I try and download my transactions from my bank I get a CC-502 error. I guess this has been an ongoing issue with many workarounds. I am very disappointed and hope Quicken gets their act together."
3,Started using Avast at the advice of my computer tech and haven't been disappointed yet. It's recognized threats that many other protection programs have not.
3,"Okay.  Office is office.  No comments needed.<br /><br />Installing this really, really, really, really sucked.  After installing it, the programs kept crashing...over and over again.  I reinstalled it three times, no help.<br /><br />Microsoft webpage acknowledges the problem as well.  They provide multiple solutions.  None of them worked.  I finally found a computer geek site that had the solution.  Several steps to have to turn off some random function from a random program that was in conflict with Office.  All good now."
3,I've used several different antivirus programs over the years and my experience with avast! has pretty much been the best so far...It isn't a memory hog the way some are and it doesn't take forever to update or scan the way some do...I've recommended it to friends and family and will continue to do so.
4,"avast! has kept me virus free, for free, for a very long time now. It's a great product and I highly recommend it."
1,"This software doesn't have ll the forms. The  plug in electric vehicle form gets you upto $7500 in tax credits. I do not understand how a company claims to provide maximum credit and refunds for an individual when this software simply cannot do that. I could not get through telephone support, I was able to get through using the live chat feature. I need to send H and R a confirmation of our receipt with a case number for a refund which they say will arrive in 4-6 weeks.<br /><br />I have used H & R in many years prior as it is cheap and it had what I wanted then."
3,"I needed internet security and usually purchase a cd. Norton Internet Security, 2013 was so much cheaper then the other ones I looked at and it was ready to download. I had a bit of a problem figuring out how to download, but that is nothing new, I am challenged :)"
1,"Quite easy to enter the tax information requested if you are prepared.  Trying to get information during the session was impossible.  Even chasing around afterwards proved to be a complete pain in the ass!  Not sure I will use Turbo Tax again unless they change their Contact-Us, Help, and FAQ system radically."
0,"But...I downloaded it, and after about 30 days, the product disappeared.  It was fine for the 30-40 or so days I was able to use it. Terribly disappointed."
2,I used H&R online version for 10 years.  This is first time used download version I like online version better than download version.
1,"Beware of the renewal process!!!!!!!!!!  The renew/install ended up crashing my system to the point that I had to do a system refresh(Windows 8.1).  I lost 2 days just getting the system back, and Bitdefender's only comment was &#34;we're sorry&#34;.  This is my 3rd year of using their software and may be my last-the software seems to work fine but their installation/update process is extremely suspect; especially the last 2 years.  They don't seem to have anyone to register a complaint with other than technical support, and they don't even have their system updated with the new registration code(s) so I can use that."
4,"I am a huge fan of Express Scribe.  I've been using it on a full-time basis.  The tools are easy to work with.  I love the ability to tweak less-than-stellar audio to get the most accurate results.  I began with the free download but as my business grew I knew the additional tools with the paid version would come in handy.  My work has paid for this smart investment many times over.  If you are looking for smart, cost-effective choices to launch your transcription business, look no further."
1,"I've used their product for years with only minor issue.  Now I am infuriated at this auto-reboot with no warning, no asking.  I've installed server products that don't even need to reboot windows ..Taxcut highly unlikely needs to even reboot.  However, it is not acceptable in any software space to reboot a device without asking!  They jumped the shark and properly too.  Good riddance next year H&R, you can't give this garbage away now."
2,"Let me start off by saying I just purchased my new MBP about two months ago and I switched over from a PC to MAC. I had quicken 2006 and was very happy with it, so I decided to take the plunge since I had a new computer to purchase this product. I was not too impressed about some of the features that I was used to, for example the end of the year feature and reconciliation is a beast to perform, I guess you have to get used to it. To be honest if I could've stayed with 2006 quicken version I would have. I do like the mobile feature about 2015. So this version is just okay for me, really nothing to write home about ,borderline 2 1/2 stars."
1,"Although the initial purchase price is good, H&R Block charged another $39.95 for the state software and another $19.95 for filing the state electronically.  Either buy the more expensive program with the inclusions or look elsewhere."
0,I bought this yesterday hoping to use it to edit some of my wedding photos.  I researched quite a bit before choosing this one and finally decided upon it because it was described as being user friendly and easy to use.  WRONG!!  I have no idea how to use this software and the walkthroughs on Corel's site don't help.  I ended up taking my pictures to another photographer to edit.  25 dollars down the drain!
3,Took a while to get to grips with it but powerful program for screenwriters. using it all the time now.
1,"It is not easy to use. You got rid of the easy \\""Find It\\"" click on all screens. It was a great short cut. When I go to catagories the list mixes sub catagories so you waste time. I believe it has set users back."
4,Both the download and the software were very easy and efficient.  Plus I don't have to worry about storing the disc!
1,"Using Q 2013R10. I edited my paycheck after upgrading from Q2010. I entered a paycheck and When I look at the split lines all say \\""zero\\"".  When I go to the  transfer accounts there is no transfer.  The categories like \\""salary\\"" show up in reports but transfers to accounts like \\""flexible spending\\"" or \\""retirement\\"" disappear.  I found them as uncategorized transactions in the report. But when I try to edit to fix I am taken back to the split window from the paycheck and all the lines say \\""zero\\"". This occurs only with the paycheck where I changed the amounts because of the new year. My wife's paycheck which is not edited still seems to work.  Mine which was edited does not.  I have been using Quicken for decades.  Always upgrade every few years.  There seems to be little customer service at quicken.com.  Just customers complaining. No response from quicken for this problem.  Quicken seems to pay more attention to reviews on Amazon since the customers still have their money.  My money is spent.  Makes me nervous to use  this information to do my taxes this year"
3,The windows version installed and upgraded my copy of 2012 on windows 7 pro with no major issues. The features in the tool for my purposes were worth the upgrade fee. I now think the budgeting module is better now than past versions.
1,"I absolutely hate the pricing and sunsetting of this program.  They drove Microsoft Money and others out of the market and the price trebled.  I wanted to hang onto Quicken 2008, but it stopped importing data.  This is subscription software hiding as a stand alone program.<br />I don't need the budgeting and report making features, but I do track my investments.  This and the automatic importation of data are features I wish the alternatives have.  So I'm stuck for now"
2,"I've used intuit products since the 90's and after trying several other financial software packages, they've just got the science down.  I only gave this version 3 stars because I don't think the price warrants any real necessary features that you MUST have.  The only thing new in this version is the Mobile app, and cloud backup neither of which I have no use far.  The program itself is still the same as 2011, 2012, and 2013 versions.<br /><br />Intuit is just changing the face and Dashboard with no real considerable upgrade to the actual program.  Bottom line is the formulas and tools used to manage finances are the same as they were a few years ago and until someone comes up with a significant method for balancing your checkbook, I would stick with what your using.<br /><br />However Intuit is known for building in &#34;Force upgrade&#34; in their products which means after some time you will not be able to automatically download transactions from your bank, but still can use it to manage your finances, and no further updates."
0,Spent 2 days trying to file an LLC. Could not get the return free of errors. First problen was it would not import last years TurboTax file.<br />Would no give proper instructions for e-file to attach the necessary PDF.<br />Paid for the TurboTax software. From startto finish it toook about 40 minutes to input and file (Included downloading the application).<br />Never again for H&R.<br />Doubt if there are returns for software as it was purchased over 30 days ago.
4,Priceless!
0,"I used this program to move applications from one Windows 7 computer  (32 bit) to another Windows 7 computer (64 bit). Even though it recommended moving all of my Adobe Programs, none of them worked after the transfer which took about 16 hours using the included ethernet transfer cable. I chose to undo the transfer using that feature of PCmover which is the only feature of this software that worked satisfactorily. Thankfully, it only took about 10 minutes to undo the mess it took 16 hours to create."
3,"I got the first version of this, and now?? With Version 4? WOW! HUGE DIFFERENCE! Take your time, learn the program, and your own logo's will be very professional looking. Well worth the $20!"

4,Great!!!! Recomend
0,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! I HAVE TRIED 2 X'S & IT WANT YOU TO REGISTER... HOW EVER THE CODE IN WHICH YOU JUST PURCHASED THE PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK!!!! BE warned. & u cannot get a hold of their tech support. Impossible. Had to cancel twice with Amazon
4,I think this is a good antivirus software. I'm satisfied with it.
3,Amazon made it easy to download onto my three computers.  The program is fine and the price was right.  Thanks for making such things so convenient.
3,Works just fine with my 10.10.1 OS X Yosemite Of course you have the update after the original download. The only thing I wish it would do is import  from my information from 2013. You have to reenter all your personal information over again.
3,I got all the assistance I needed with rent income and college education expenses to prepare my taxes. It took many hours of work but I feel good about the final result.
0,"DOES NOT INCLUDE STATE EFILE COST - I thought the whole point of &#34;paying&#34; for the software &#34;deluxe + state&#34; meant that it includes the cost of efile which is why i purchased this software. All it does it prepare it for free, the efile is extra. There are free options out there that prepare, the efile is always the means to make $$$. These scum are having you pay up front for mediocre software then charging additionally for efile of state. Worst part was when I had to delay in filing because the state program wasnt available yet (meaning: I had paid extra for software to prepare my state taxes only to find out it was actually even available). Had I known i would have stuck with turbo tax for free and simply paid the efile fees. SO MUCH SIMPLER. They are just scheming people who dont pay attention to the fine print. Avoid this. Ran on macbook with OSx 10.10.2 with no issues in terms of software/hardware compatibilities."
2,this was easy designer program that was fairly self-explainitory the stair don' t automatically setup from one level to the other.  the roof is hard to manipulate to the different roof styles.  these are problems i have had . and if you know how these could be more easily rectified it would be of great assistance if you shared.  my email is bdconnell717@yahoo.com  thanks!
1,they changed everything....view etc.<br />old versions are user-friendly.<br />You have to get used to it...why changing all the time the user-view
1,"I bought my Turbo Tax package at Staples and thought that 1 state return was included. When I tried to file, I had to agree to pay extra for the state return. I thought the price was something like $29 but I was charged $54.98. I think this was a bait and switch deal.<br /><br />In the past I have always been able to print my return, look it over for errors on hard copy, and then mail it in.  This time, the program would not let me print until I had filed the return electronically. I have used this program for at least 5 or more years and this was the worst experience I have had. I will probably use another program next year as I have heard of problems from other users this year.<br /><br />I was not satisfied."
1,Fair item
0,"Disappointed in the service by Norton.  As I indicated, receive notices that my purchase is only temporary.<br />Wonder how long it will take for a correction to be made."
3,Slightly more intrusive than previous years but still OK.  Managing the licenses is a little tricky.  BUT it has consistently prevented any bugs from getting into my systems (win7 and win8)
2,"It will download my bank transactions fine, but will not update the online balance.  I have sent in my question to their help line, but have not received a reply.<br /><br />If they can fix this problem. then I will rate again."

3,I would recommend purchasing here at Amazon because it is cheaper & it is the same product that Norton's website sells for $80.00!! The only problem I had at first was the download didn't work after purchase. I had to contact Amazon for instructions. They instructed me right away on how to get it to download!!
0,"We were looking to purchase the app to download onto our computer and found that the version that we purchased was meant to be used while online. While attempting to get in touch with someone our wait time was more than 45 minutes. We conducted business which lead us to purchase a different version o the QUICKBOOK program and while waiting for a credit for the previously purchased program, we were disconnected. Twice we were told that we would receive an email, no email received."
3,"I like it, when I download, it op-up tell me that it is safe or block but it is still not strong enough."
4,Great purchase.  Easy to download and install in minutes.  Turbotax always saves us money.  Amazon is the one with the best deals every year as well.
1,"Bloatware alert - it puts more than a Start button on the desktop without asking you,"
0,"I just called H&R customer support number asking how to use the software (purchased Premier + Business version) to report closing costs for new home purchased in 2014. After holding on the phone for 45min, instead of any guidance or support at all, I was given an 800 number to contact a H&R tax adviser but which turned out to be the IRS hotline number. I am completely shocked!<br />Needless to say, I'm returning the software for refund. (They claim 100% money back within 60 days fyi)."
2,"Even though this is the Federal + State + eFile version, you still have to pay an additional $19.95 to eFile your state Taxes. Keep in mind you have the option to print and mail it. Only the Federal eFile is included in the purchase price. This upset me, but since I bought the software for 50% off at $21.99, it wasn't that huge of a deal. It was still a huge shock to have to pay if I want to eFile the state; I should have researched prior to purchase. The software works great, runs smoothly, and was worth the money."
2,"Norton still remains a good antivirus. I always recommended, specially for the price."
3,"Great buy, Download simple, be sure you get that Key code and keep it close you'll need it to efile your Fed return. But,, This is \\""not\\"" a free state efile."
0,hard to use and understand
3,Overall it is fine and very similar to previous versions. There is one thing that is missed from previous versions. Transfers now require using a drop down to access where before it was an icon that could be clicked. Maybe I am the only one that routinely transfers funds between accounts but I miss the easy access to transfers.
2,a little more unwieldy than last year and not sure I did miscellaneous deductions to the best effect
3,Has worked well for me.
3,"I hate being stuck with a certain suite of programs, but this one so far (knock on wood) is working great!  Best price for a very reliable payroll solution that I have found--plus I am very familiar with Quickbooks, so it is very easily integrated into my regular bookkeeping."
1,"So I upgraded from Mac 2011 to Mac 2013 without realising that it was not backward compatible. I requested a backup CD from Intuit which when it arrived was 2012. NOT A GOOD START.<br /><br />The software is buggy, I want a customer report which I can filter by sales rep, it allows me to do this but misses a HUGE chunk of that sales reps accounts, I have checked and they are associated with that rep - no fix I can find online.<br /><br />Now my headoffice has to buy this buggy version to look at the accounts which are uploaded to the Cloud as it won't load on 2011.<br /><br />All in all I WISH WISH WISH I had not switched to MAC last year. The MAC is the only reason I keep this version but its that bad I am considering buy another computer to run the window version. Either that or bin it and start again.<br /><br />The most annoying part is the constant crashing, I run a quad core 2012 Mac 27\\"" with 12gb ram - apparently this is not enough to stop this program crashing mid invoice?<br /><br />Massively disappointed, 2011 for windows was better and still is...."
1,"I've been using this product for a couple of months now, and have found it fairly easy to edit video with. Not terrific, but OK.<br /><br />My huge problem is that while trying to create a DVD with menus and sub-menus (nothing complex), this product crashed several times, in different places, but always when I had completed more than an hour of work creating the DVD menu. There did not seem to be a place to save the menu work, and so I had to start over several times. The kicker was that when I was done editing, and was creating the DVD and an ISO file - after about 45 minutes of processing, the system crashed, and nearly all my work was lost. I did get the ISO file, but my work needed tweaking, and you can't use the ISO for that.<br /><br />My PC is new, with huge amounts of memeory and a fast, new CPU, and I'm running XP. Buyers beware."
0,"I've been using Quicken 2005 for years and thought it was time to upgrade. However, 2011 has no ability to set a yearly budget and see how you are doing against it during the year. How does a new product go backwards? I returned it and went back to 2005."
3,"This (did) work very well for a number of years. HOWEVER, be aware that Mavericks and this, while compatible, is very buggy - you often times have to do things light highlighting twice or even three times. I am told by those who know that this is because Office for Mac should have been updated by now (a la 2014 version) but has not been"
2,"My advice is to buy the H&R Block tax program, easier to use and much cheaper.  The H&R Block program imports all TurboTax files from prior years.  Is not as cumbersome or complicated as TurboTax."
3,This is a wonderful product and very supportive team.  I am so happy to have this product -- that being said there are still a few glitches that I expect will very shortly justify a FIVE STAR.
2,"Althought I have used Photoshop for many years, but my skills are limited on those basic function of this software. Therefore, it is really useful to go through this program to explore the great potential of Photoshop. However, the software design is not user friendly. I bought the Mac version, but it won't play on my Macbook Pro. Therefore, I had to install Windows in my mac to play the DVD. To install the virtual DVD driver was not straightforward, and it neither works well afterwards, so I have to reinstall it now and then. In Windows 7 system, the program window can't be maximized, which is annoying."
0,Upgrading to the 2012 version not only locked me out of my data but also updated my data file so I can't open it again in the 2010 version.  I am so angry right now and the only support I have been able to get is someone telling me I need to work through a series of steps in order to have one of their tech people unlock the file.  AVOID AVOID AVOID.
3,"Only problem was that with the state e-file, the state of rhode island only accepts 9 digit employer's ID numbers - turbo tax took all the ID numbers which we had that had been 11 digits and I had to go in to correct this before the state would accept the e-filed return.  I wasn't the only one with this problem - i had been trying to figure out why rhode island wasn't accepting our return when the federal had and then in the turbo tax questions & answers someone brought that up - once I corrected it to 9 digits (took off the last 2 zero's) it went thru.  I've made notes for next year"
0,"We have used Quickbooks for our retail store since it came out, many years ago. It was great at first - easy to use, reasonably priced. But recently it has become difficult to like this software and Intuit itself. Each year they have a new, money-grabbing tactic; abandoning version support, forced, costly upgrades, charging per employee, limiting installs. Now, I am starting an additional business with only two employees. I have been researching using Quickbooks with Payroll, but after reading the reviews here and on the Costco website, I will not be purchasing it. I called Quickbooks directly to ask questions, but the hold time was endless and when I finally reached someone, their English was so poor it was difficult to ask questions and understand answers. I did, however, gather that it would be expensive for me to implement the software for my minimum needs. I suspect that both the on-line and physical versions with payroll include additional and hidden charges that would make using this prohibitively expensive for me, and it is clear the company is migrating to on-line only, so purchasing the physical software is likely to be a waste of money when they abandon that version. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INNOVATIVE INTUIT SOFTWARE COMPANY? I can recall years ago thinking I should invest in Intuit because their products and service were unique and superior to others, but obviously that is no longer true. I will be purchasing a competitor product. Sad."
2,"This version is still new and I have only used it for a few days.  So far everything seems to work.  HOWEVER, registering this product took a couple hours and left me extremely angry with Intuit.  When you purchase this product you are provided with a product key to install but later after you do all the setup and configuration your are then required to contact Intuit by phone for a \\""validatiion code\\"".  Took three calls to get someone without an accent that I could understand, (outsourcing at it's best!), then they would not give me the required code unless I provided them with my address, phone number and email address, none of which I want them to have.  They do sell your information to third party companies and also conduct an extensive in house marketing program.  I don't need another 8 or 10 advertisements every month.  I bounced the call to a supervisor and essentially was told the same thing.  I asked for a refund and was told that was not possible because I had already installed the software (which won't run without he \\""validation code\\"" they won't give me)  Long story shortened, after a very unhappy conversation and finally I asked for the corporate headquarters phone number, she gave me a validation number and said thank you and hung up. I plan on finding another US manufacturer if I can."
0,Quicken seems to get dumber every year with respect to its ability to properly categorize repeat transactions.  I keep hoping that it will improve and every year I buy the new version it seems the program is worse than previous years.  This year's version is the worst of all.  Microsoft Money was a wonder compared to this.  I also find the &#34;Report&#34; feature unwieldy compared to Money.  How hard can it be to fix these things?
0,"I buyed the software microsoft outlook 2010, but I can´t download the program, an error appears.  Please help me with this problem. I live in Costa Rica."
0,"I helped my wife upgrade from the 2008 version to the Deluxe 2012 version for her  new laptop.  She is the one that uses it and she HATES IT! It's time to get out  year-end reports and she is in tears.  She has the Home and Business version but it's  use is mainly for personal accounting. If she can just get through this, I will try  to find her some other software that is more user friendly."
3,There are some very nice changes with this upgrade. It takes a little time to get comfortable with new arrangements. I am still attempting to figure out what happened to the dodge and burn tools - so there are those types of issues. I think it will all work out. Great value.
3,"As in the past, I continue to trust Turbo Tax, and 2014 product was about as simple as it could be."
1,"I have this a try as an option to replace my use of Quickbooks for business and Mint for personal finance tracking. It fell short in both categories.<br /><br />Compared to its (free) counterpart from the same company, the personal version is cumbersome and not intuitive. The business side and the split between home and business is also not so simple to use.<br /><br />I have removed this from my computer and still use Mint for personal finance and QuickBooks for business. This was not worth the money."
1,too complicated...but it did seem like a good product just not what I was looking for
3,As always the program just gets easier. The price just keeps going up. I am required to file a Ca. state even though I don't owe anything. I feel that the Turbo Tax Fee to e-file  the Ca return is excessive.
0,"Too many cookies, poor software"
3,"I am still trying to get it to reliably communicate with my bank. It might be the banks software not recognizing the new version, so I am not mad at Quicken - yet!"
1,"I have been a Quicen user for a few years. In April 2013, Quicken quit downloading my data and demanded I upgrade to Quicken 2013. I ponied up the money because I needed to balance the family budget and pay the bills. Now comes Quicken 2014 update, which sucked $70+ from my wallet but then REFUSED to download/integrate my checking account data unless I created a valid Intuit login and included my name and home address. Amazing---it took my money, then would not work unless I gave it more. With MSMoney long out of business, I can't help but wonder if Quicken is beginning to behave like a monopolist. I am actively looking for alternatives because I am done throwing cash Intuit's way."
2,"I haven't noticed any big improvements over the last release. Not sure why a new release was needed except to make more money. I have used Quicken for my personal finances for decades, literally, and I like it a lot, but I just don't understand the need for 2014."
0,Mobile app doesn't reflect the information on the desktop. BUMMER. Its a good thing there's a 60day money back guarantee.
4,comodo is the best
3,"It appears that this year you have done a major update to the way the dashboard appears. So far I like it. Some things were a bit harder to find (Loans for example) but once I did, then it was OK."
3,"AVAST PAID PREMIER PROGRAM<br /><br />I downloaded avast free anti-virus some months ago. It worked fine, and this made me decide to get the paid version. I went for the Premier version. A tech downloaded it for me, on remote access, and had it working good in little time.<br /><br />It was a problem when I had a hard disk failure, and I had to reload avast on the new drive. I was unaware of how to reload myself, (Us older users are used to getting a disk with our programs, but this does not necessarily happen), so I called the help line. Since the original installation, it appears that they have cancelled remote help, and gone for some remote company overseas, to assist, for the princely sum of A$200.00+, which seems to give you 12 months of help. That makes it the most expensive antivirus program that I have ever used, over decades.<br /><br />I have had a serious glitch, where something corrupted the Premier program, and made it unuseable, while also preventing me from uninstalling it. I did not call their overseas helper, as they are an unknown quantity, and it could be a very expensive call, as I only have a mobile. But I had an IT mate solve my problem. This would be the first anti-virus program that I have used in 3 or more decades, which has been corrupted. That would question the efficiency of the programming maybe, or possibly it was some new type of nasty. (I regularly do run my anti-programs, and often clean out the gunk that collects on the system).<br /><br />Having said that, it otherwise now appears to work fine, but I wonder if the program should be working inside a sandbox. I can understand their need to control their expenses, but if they indeed have 233+ million clients, you would think that would generate quite a chunk of revenue for operating expenses. Possibly most of those millions of users might be users of the free version? My only motives for writing this, are to wish for better customer service (since they are often dealing with non-techclients), and to wish that they find an alternative to pushing the client to bear extra cost over the price of the program. I will continue to use the program, and be the beta tester for it. Stay tuned.<br />Davo."
3,"I've been using a desktop version of QuickBooks for a couple of years and am so excited to finally be using an online versions.  I'm still figuring out how to do a few things, but everything so far has been easier than before."
0,Did not receive the $25.00 even though I did everything for the rebate. Purchased &#34;Deluxe&#34; for 2013 but had to send $ 30.00 more to get a form I needed. According to Turbotax this disqualified me from receiving the Rebate. Because TurboTax is so efficient I did not switch to another product.
3,This is an excellent photo editor for all or family needs at a fantastic price. Adobe can be relied on.
0,Didn't see the benefits
4,"I am a 73 year old grandmother who has been using the first Cook'n software since the year 2000 when a copy was given as a gift. I found it to be very people friendly and is formatted in a way that a person such as me, that is not very computer literate can navigate. I have continued to purchase the new upgrades and have found that Dan Oaks and his company are constantly keeping up with modern technology. I have been able to save and print a Family Cookbook using my favorite recipes that I have collected over the years. I do not have a smart phone but with Cook'n ``, I have the program on my Kindle and comes with me wherever I go. I also own Master Cook, and Big Oven but Cook'n beats them all, not only in what the program can do, but the excellent CUSTOMER SERVICE. Of course, my first CD's customer service was made by phone and spoke to a live person, but I can understand with the volume of software sold, that is now impossible. However, whenever I have a problem, I find that customer service responds in a reasonable period of time.<br /><br />Why no voting buttons? We don't let customers vote on their own reviews, so the voting buttons appear only when you look at reviews submitted by others.<br /><br />Permalink"
2,"Be warned. This video editing software has some really irritating behavior. Apparently, Cyberlink doesn't feel it has to conform to the Windows programming standards. So when you have each pane set to the size and placement you like and then exit, you've just lost those settings. You've also lost the size and location of the overall application windows. When you next open PD13, the window will be maximized and the Timeline, Media Content and Preview panes will be at their &#34;default&#34; sizes. Really, really irritating to have to manually size everything to your liking each and every time you open the application.<br /><br />This gets 3 stars because of the video editing functionality of the software, otherwise I would have given it 1 star for the massive failure to conform to the simplest of Windows programming standards."
4,Excellent product.
2,"I don't think I gained a bit of functionality over Q2010.  The changed a few things, but I don't think it performs any better or even much different."
3,"I am not impressed with many of the feature of this software.  You can not access the PDF component for one and you can not use the Accountant's import function.<br /><br />The company should include basic payroll options in the software instead of a separate purchase.  This is certainly a inconvenience to customers.  Intuit should restructure pricing to accommodate loyal customers.  Pricing is way to expensive for what is offered.  The company should not try to compete with Sage/Peachtree and other premium accounting software companies.  There are certainly to many products offered by Intuit.  (i.e. QB Pro, Payroll and Premier should be one package)  I have used Intuit products for over 25 years and this is just my opinion.  Another thing I will always purchase through Amazon rather that Intuit."
3,An OK product.
4,"Is super easy to install and use. Give total control of your budget and keep tracking of your money.. Also, the bill reminder is great!"
2,"Works fine, just taking a while, pretty complicated if you never did any of this before. You better have a knowledgable friend or a book for dummies,"
1,"After reading the reviews here, I decided to spend the extra few dollars and bought Office Home and Student 2013 directly from Microsoft.  If you have any doubts, I suggest you do the same."
0,I've been a TurboTax Deluxe user for many years but they changed the software this year and will no longer allow you to enter Schedule C or Dividend income without upgrading to higher levels of the software.  I called and they said they would upgrade it for free this year but I would have to pay the higher prices next year.  I just tried H&R Block Deluxe and it works just like this product used to work.
4,The instructions to download and install for Amazon were easy follow and I was able to easily download and install the program.
4,Easy to use.  I've been doing this for the past 5 years.  Would recommend it to anyone.
2,"After my in-store purchase of the Deluxe edition the past two years, I was surprised to find this digital copy did not provide a free e-file for my state taxes. Guess I should have looked closer!"
2,It works fine...always updating...but recently was hacked on FB...not sure if that is covered by my avast
3,I was a little unhappy with Norton last year I had purchased Norton 360 in Sept of 2014 and soon after they came out with Norton Security. They provided no way to upgrade so i waited until my time ran out and considered going to another Security Suite.  But I didn't I do like the way this works and I have used Norton for a long time. Folks it works put in a little time and learn how to use it and keep it updated and you will be better off. Amazon provides you the new key and the price is right for the consumer. I will probably reorder next year.
0,Will not install and HR Block Customer support is taking hours
3,I have useed this before and it is great
0,The software will not activate real time scanning. Every time I select that option it turns it on only to turn it back off within seconds.<br /><br />Of the four security programs I have used this is the only totally unsatisfactory program.<br /><br />I bought it because it was cheapest. Money thrown away since I will have to buy something else to keep me safe.
0,Still doesn't work and you won't refund my money.<br /><br />Do you seriously want my feedback?
0,I always use the online Version of Turbo tax however this one was cheaper than doing it online... I read the requirement to install Turbo tax and it should had work on windows 7 however when i click to run the program it keeps saying we know it's taking a little more than a moment. ANd it never opens it was a waste of money you'll better  off using the online version....
1,Wasn't useful to me.
4,It works for me
3,I was upset at intuit for splitting the forms I required between programs but in the end they made it right. Customer pressure can be a great thing. Quality of the program was what I expected from TurboTax. They will be my first go to next year.
2,"Seems the same as 2011 which we were forced to replace in order to keep payroll service. Straight up extortion imo. It can't be that hard to support a version for more than three years when you are charging $450. a year for payroll service (we have five employees). The new websy (for lack of a better word) interface changes button placements for no real reason that I can see. Pages within the program do not scale properly, meaning when you change the quickbooks window size it will cut off the right side such as where the amounts are in a check register. Previous users will also not like the new left side &#34;open windows&#34; options and I cannot start this version without it automatically opening the purchase orders and vendor center screens for some unknown reason. Not the worst iteration I have seen since 1993 but would not have gotten it if we didn't have too."
1,"Actually a 3 star rating is more appropriate. I found this version much less user friendly than Premier.<br />I learned after purchasing Turbotax Home and Business from Amazon, that it was not appropriate  - that I should have continued to use Premier.<br />I would like to us Premier but find that I would have to pay full price.<br />Do I have any other recourse? I like Premier very much.<br />Kathie"
2,I thought the credit report section would be more informative than what is presented. I actually purchased the product for the rental and credit report.  There appears to be no reason for the upgrade for me because I have not utilized the rental side of the program. I own the 2013 version. The program does an excellent delivery in bringing all of your accounts together into one comprehensive area on your computer.  No program does it better than QUICKEN!
3,"As far as I can tell there isn't much difference, if any, from Quicken 2014. Once I got used to the changes in 2014, I liked the product so still do but feel I paid $40 for an upgrade that gave me nothing except maybe the tax planning which won't fill in for 2014 from the data. I have to enter by hand."
2,Plenty of online helps like the PDF output and the top page instruction at print  if your after a program that's simple to run and follow get this one
3,"Original [brief] review: Slideshow features could be improved, but it works well for basic video editing.<br /><br />Updated [long] review (11 January 2016)...<br /><br />Updating my review from 3 stars to 4 stars since I've been using this more extensively for the last few months. I still think the slideshow features aren't very good, but that's really not what I'm using PowerDirector for now. For slideshow stuff, I create the slideshow video in Photodex ProShow Gold 5 (it's an older version but does exactly what I need it to do). I can then import the slideshow video into Cyberlink if I want to integrate it with other video and/or create a DVD.<br /><br />For basic video editing, the features are pretty intuitive (compared t several other video editors I've used). I'm mainly cropping out sections I don't want, combining video, adding captions, and rarely adding in background audio. PowerDirector does a lot of other &#34;fancy&#34; things, but I'm probably more of a &#34;basic&#34; user. I do like the feature that automatically compresses your video to fit on a DVD if you've gone a little over (&#34;smart fit&#34; I think). The DVD menus took me a while to figure out. They're lacking and CyberLink tries to get you to join their website to download additional templates. This looked like a pain and I didn't find what I wanted anyway. I figured out how to get their basic menus to work for me; which don't need to be fancy. I'm not sure if I'm doing &#34;chapters&#34; right, but the only way I could get separate DVD chapters setup was to have several different projects, render to video, and import all the videos into a new project before creating a disk. If there's a better way of doing this, I couldn't find it. There's also a skip/delay when the videos transition between chapters on DVD players. I'm not sure if this is normal behavior, but it doesn't bother me too much for family videos (wouldn't work well for something professional).<br /><br />There's a newer version (14) that's available. I know this because I'm inundated with ads on PowerDirector 13 trying to get me to upgrade. I've looked into the differences and version 13 does everything I need it to do, so not worth the cost of upgrading to me. If I was buying new, I would get the latest version of course (not sure if you can still buy the old version anyway).<br /><br />As far as performance, I had a lot of problems with rendering and speed when I first set up PowerDirector. I then got a better computer (latest Intel i7, 16GB RAM, lots of other expensive goodies, etc). I installed Windows 10 on this machine, and then PowerDirector. Lots of issues with crashing until I disabled some kind of hardware support setting (via some recommendation in a random google search), and then everything &#34;just worked&#34;...  no crashing and the thing worked beautifully. This is part of my fear of upgrading to v14 (that I might actually spend money to break a working configuration and/or waste a lot of time I don't have).<br /><br />Overall, this has become a great purchase (after working through numerous issues and the learning curve). I have edited dozens (maybe hundreds) of small family videos, and some work videos. I use PowerDirector to create DVD images, then burn the images multiple times to DVDs to mail to family. I would give five stars if the DVD menu configuration was more intuitive and flexible. I just kind of live with what it does; which is &#34;OK&#34; for what I need it to do. As far as the slideshows, it would be great if it did everything that Proshow Gold does, but I understand that slideshow creation is not this products primary purpose.<br /><br />So, a long review but I've used PowerDirector 13 a lot. I don't plan to upgrade to v14, but that's not a shortcoming of v13 (actually a testament to the strength of v13... and my fear that things will break when I &#34;upgrade&#34;).ecause I'm inundated with ads on PowerDirector 13 trying to get me to upgrade.

1,"This review is for the business portion only. Cheap, and poorly built. I have been using H&R Block for several years. It is hard to use and buggy. It is a nightmare to  find the form using &#34;go to&#34; button. There are two big issues. First, the numbers are not right and conflicting. For example, the distributed income is duplicated to &#34;stock basis&#34; and &#34;accumulated adjustments account&#34;. This is scary. It is basically inaccurate. You need to know what you are doing and using at your risk. Second, there are no interview questionnaires for state business return. It only provides you with a form. What the heck!"

Toast 10 just starts extracting ALL THE SONGS, and way too fast for good quality too.<br /><br />2.  With Toast 7 you can extract music from a CD at any bit or rate you chose, up to 64 kHz/64 Bits.  The reason I tried Toast 10 was that I needed to extract from one Super CD at 24/96, but there are no options for quality or bitrates on Toast 10 AT ALL!!<br /><br />3.  The Toast 10 User Manual does not mention Extracting either."
2,"I needed to file in multiple states and was under the impression that additional states were $29.99 with turbo tax vs $39.99 with HR Block which helped tip the scales in favor of turbo tax. It turns out that additional states were $39.99 plus tax with turbo tax as well which more than doubled my original purchase price. Very happy with the step by step guidance in the software though. I also was surprised to find out it was going to cost an additional $19.99 per state to e-file, I thought that was included since the product title says e-file! Wish they'd be more upfront about the true cost"
2,Liked my Quicken 2007 better. 2014 too busy for me!
3,"Very good product, have used it for many years.  particularly like the 5 user license package, multi device.  Can use it for all my devices now instead of just the desktop."
1,why do they have to have a keyboard recorder in their av scanner and who do they send this information to?
4,"easy to use and always thorough. the largest refund that you can get, doing your own taxes"
2,"I have been using Quicken on a Mac since 1988. Basically, I have relied upon Quicken to organize my finances for 27 years and I'm very happy with the results. However, the high point was Quicken 2007 for Mac. When Quicken Essentials replaced that a couple of years later, they removed the utility of being able to pay bills from within the application. Unfortunately, that bill paying utility has not been reinstated in Quicken 2015 for Mac. I just don't understand why, as it is routinely included in Quicken for Windows.<br /><br />Come on Intuit, stop treating your faithful Mac customers like second class citizens!"
4,"I initially experienced self-inflicted problems doing the installation - I foolishly interrupted the process to go and find my key code.  I was able to resolve it quickly & easily however while I was trying, I sent email to Webroot support.  I received an acknowledgement right away and a response the next day, Sunday.  The support team was very helpful, speedy, and responsive.  The software has a simple yet feature-rich user interface.  It uses very few system resources.  I am really liking it so far.  BTW this product received very strong evaluations from test labs, PC Magazine, and other independent sources.  I think it is reasonably priced for what you get  - and what you get is fabulous!"
3,my other checkbook was an absolute mess...i decided to use this method and everything in and it helps me when i come home from shopping and i can enter my expenses.
1,"I don't want to go into too much detail - I don't have the time.<br />I was reluctant to purchase this product, for multiple reasons, but decided I needed to implement SOMETHING and almost all the companies I use for my small graphic design business integrate with Quickbooks.<br /><br />I am not an accountant - but I do have several business degrees, computer degrees and certifications and took accounting courses.  I found this software to be very tedious, time consuming and confusing to install.  I have had it for several months and still do not have it completely ready yet.<br /><br />I installed the Professional Services package.  I have a large inventory and in order to have everything run smoothly (quotes, estimates, etc), you have to input the inventory.  Being a very small company - who has the time?  I have had several friends come over to help and still not there yet.<br /><br />I find the \\""help\\"" section more confusing and incomplete.  Intuit seems to be most focused on add-on selling than supporting.  I spoke with a customer service rep and they just kept trying to talk me into purchasing more add-ons. I did install a couple add-ons and they ended up locking my system up.<br /><br />I have been selling eCommerce for 6 years and never had any problems with viruses.  I use a top notch virus protection program and am very careful.  Recently I ended up with a virus/trojan that crashed my entire network and I had to rebuild from scratch.  Something tells me, it has something to do with Quickbooks.  Call it a hunch.<br /><br />If you are willing to hire an outside resource to help set it up - which will end up costing a few hundred more dollars - then this is the product for you.  Otherwise, if you are a small business, carry multiple products, and sell multi-channel - I would question the purchase and look for a cloud based erp system instead.  Just my two cents."
0,"I read others reviews and like most of them have used the Print Shop product for YEARS!  Have always loved it.  When Print Shop 23 no longer worked with the newer windows version, I was forced to purchased new.  Reviews for any brands (including this) were horrible so I made the decision to stick with what I knew and loved and figured people just didn't know how to use it or something.  I didn't have any issues downloading like some people said.  I do have a computer less than a year old with plenty of everything so I have no compatibility issues in that regard.  I started using the software and everything people are saying about the pathetic-ness of this even being remotely comparable to any Print Shop you have used prior is 100% accurate.  Adding a headline or changing something in a headline can take anywhere for 5 - 10 seconds just to appear on a page.  Add a back drop?  Couldn't even find it - everything is grayed out in the toolbar most of the time - you can't even tell if it works.  Seems like you have to add a picture to your picture library there to use one - the last thing you need is pictures stored in yet another place - are you kidding me!  Nothing is intuitive and yes I happen to like the newest version of Microsoft Word and Excel which is the look and feel of this.  It's just poor in my opinion.  Total and complete waste - if you've ever used Print Shop prior, you will hate it!!!!!  Not only did they miss the boat, they can't swim!"
4,Great product!! I've been using Quicken for more than 10 years and appreciate all the functionality and usability improvements you have made. Thanks
1,"I downloaded this version just to start my accounts clean using my old fashion manual entry, but I admit, this program has issues.  Just in setting up an account it contridicts itself asking for a STATEMENT ENDING BALANCE and in the same page on the opposite side of the dialog box it says in parantheses that Quicken will use this number as an OPENING BALANCE, so how it can be an opening and ending balance is just one of the issues with this version.  I used Quicken for many years b4 my wife took it over for the past 5 years.  It being my turn I wanted it to begin clean and that is not easy with this unfriendly program.  I find myself searching for changing the simpliest of settings and later discover some download banking functions like date range is not available to be designated by Quicken even though banks will allow whatever each respective one's policy.  I too am an Intuit customer of over 10 years and this is the worst program by far and I have only been using it via manual entry, so if it is not as easy as balancing your checkbook the way we did in the '60's, I find this to be the worst year for this program and also when I contacted clueless customer service.  JEM ( MBA w/IT/GS BA)"
2,"Being a Corel PaintShop Pro user, I expected Video Studio to be more than just the Corel version of Windows Movie maker. It is fairly user friendly, but just a simple cut and paste editor, not a more robust &#34;Professional&#34; feature laden type of editor. So my review is mixed. I like how easy it is to use but I wish it could do more than what it does."
4,"Works great for me!  I've had several Viruses detected before they caused a problem, and the software does not slow down my PC.  I've also had several offers for other free virus protection offered to me by my local cable company and online services, but I have decided stay with Avast.  Why fix something that's not broke.  I have tried Norton's, Panda, McAfee, AVG, and a few others and AVAST has been the least invasive yet works great."
0,Free to download but if you want it to work it'll cost you. Try Panda instead.
3,I am having some issues with balancing my accounts but i am liking all of the features
1,"I had a complicated stock transaction which involved re-invested dividends.  There was a glitch in their program, which their research department was trying to fix.  They never fixed it and never got back to me.  I had to file by hand and mail in.  Never received feedback or money back for product failure.  This was the last time I used Turbo Tax."
2,This product has not really changed in year and that is fine with me.  In years past +5 there were changes made that were really downgrades and I would rather have no change thn poorly made changes.
4,"I have written a lot of really large documents using several word processors.  Sometimes a formatting code would get stuck in Microsoft Office (it never deletes codes, it just adds more layers) that we just couldn't find and caused all kinds of font or formatting problems.  I would run the file into WordPerfect and find the offending code and eliminate it and then re-export the file back to Word, because that is what we must use.  I hate the new thin clients because the system administrators are becoming dictators again (like back in the old mainframe days) and good products like WordPerfect will have a tougher time in business again.  The control the tech editor has with WordPerfect is so much better than any other word processor."
1,"In fact, I got locked out my older program and couldn't download any anymore banking transactions (I was blocked) due to the 3-year mandatory update.  The face of the update changed, but I really don't see any new features I could use. Any case the update did not get rid of the block out of the expired  program.  It took some effort and had to unlock  every account individually to get the download feature run properly again, so don't let your account expire after 3-years-- it is a pain.<br /><br />I really only use this product to keep track of invoices, banking, and credit cards. I run about ten different types of reports and they haven't changed in years. Don't track my (stocks) investments with this; just don't see the need. Investments institutions download straight into tax software at the end of the year using the automated 1099.<br /><br />Pro's: good software all around-no complaints, in terms of performance. Meets my needs and should easily meet the needs of any home based business.<br /><br />Con's: I don't like the mandatory updates every three years. I guess I rather pay a fee for the download use; rather than an update that causes me more trouble, I am referring to the download block out. After years of use, I can't see any benefit to the updates anymore. Do they really update or just move stuff around? I feel like I'm walking down the isles of  local Costco; they are always moving stuff to a different isle."
4,I've been using AVAST for a few years now and for a free product it is truly worth the membership.  It gives me piece of mind knowing it will catch viruses and infected files and it actually provides periodic reports of the findings.  I haven't purchased the full protection since it's a business laptop but the added security doesn't hurt.  I highly recommend for the budget conscious.
0,Great price but you do NOT get to use it for a year before it turns its' self off and bombards you with ads to renew for $40! At about10 months you.re done using it!! The problem with this review is no one will see it because this product (2014) is history and the new one out is labeled 2015 with no reviews about the short lived use of the programming. I would suggest going to Walmart and getting a disc to download utilities on your computer.
2,Actual program was fast and easy to use. Only problem is that I had to download it a second time because it did not download correctly the first time (no fault of my own). E-file fees are expensive too. $17.95 for each E-File return plus an additional $29.99 fee if you decide to take fees out of your refund. (Total: $65+) Better off going to H&R Block Tax Cut online. You can do your Federal and State Taxes (plus E-File) for only $38.21. Only discovered that after I purchased the TurboTax Download.
2,"I am disappointed. Each time I want to use this program, I am waiting with baited breath to see whether it will open or not.<br />How can contact the Quicken customer service people?"
2,"Not as professional as I was expecting. There is a ton of things you can do with it, color correct, really cool transitions, adjust the brightness and contrast, the stabilizer is really nice, the timeline is easy to use once you figure out everything that you can do with it. It needs some updates though. The titles and credit rolls, for example, are not anything special, I can't figure out how to put subtitles in without changing the transparency of the video. Like you can't have subtitles over a video because the lettering is it's own &#34;clip' so you have to make the transparency of the video dim to see the lettering underneath. The color correct is mediocre, you only have three colors to adjust, blue green and red unlike other software where they give you like a color spectrum to choose any shade or mixture you need. Than pan and crop is not very amazing. I think the free app that comes with the mac, imovie, is more advanced, or just as advanced, as this. I am now going to invest in apple products, they have amazing editing software."
4,Highly recommended.
4,real good
3,"I've been using TurboTax for many years and I'm quite satisfied with the easy of use. If I had to cite a problem it would be that you can't alternate between online version and desktop version in terms of getting previous year's data automatically imported. This year, I went back to the desktop version because I found it at Amazon at a lower price than the online version I had used in previous years."
0,"downloaded investment transactions don't appear in the 'accept' window unless you close the software and reopen.<br />Account balances don't update in the summary bar unless you redownload or reopen the software<br />Fonts are terrible.  In order to get it to be visible, one must disable DPI on the program properties and even that does not return it to quality of Q2011 and Windows 7.  Quicken will tell you its all MS Win 8 problem ...maybe.  But  how can Q then force us to upgrade<br />Loan payment process, schedule, repeating, and the like is totally changed and very difficult to understand.  My mortgage payment was late as a result.  I think I have it right now but its been hours and hours trying to figure it out."
3,"So far, Norton Internet Security 2014 seems as good as 2013. Even though this &#34;Small Business&#34; version is designated for 5 users, instead of the 3 users permitted by my previous &#34;home&#34; versions, I see no difference in the interface at all, which is fine.<br /><br />I give this product a &#34;5&#34;. The Amazon.com price -- $15.38 -- is excellent.<br /><br />The reason this review has &#34;4&#34; stars is the unbelievable yearly hassle of installing and registering Norton Internet Security purchased from someone other than Norton. That is due to Norton's territoriality and its determination to make all of us pay higher prices than the Amazon price.<br /><br />So I have some advice that I hope will make it easier for others to purchase, download and install this product.<br /><br />Purchase from Amazon.com was smooth. A small window contained two buttons -- one for &#34;Install&#34; and the other &#34;view product key.&#34; I copied the product key to a separate Notepad file and saved them to the computer desktop.<br /><br />Once the product downloaded, it told me it must uninstall the previous version of Norton and restart my computer. That is customary.<br /><br />My Mistake During Uninstall of Previous Version: I clicked on &#34;Keep my personal settings as I am renewing a previous product&#34; instead of &#34;Discard my personal settings, I am installing another product.&#34;<br /><br />Clicking on the first option meant that the new program didn't appear -- apparently Norton simply reinstalled my about-to-expire 2013 version during my computer's restart!<br /><br />First Solution: I manually uninstalled the previous 2013 Norton version. When asked if I wanted to &#34;Keep my personal settings&#34; or &#34;Discard my personal settings&#34; -- I clicked &#34;Discard.&#34;<br /><br />You will be asked to tell Norton why you are leaving them -- ignore and close that screen. I then restarted my computer.<br /><br />I then downloaded the 2014 version from the Amazon.com &#34;My Software Library&#34; again. Norton still appeared -- on my screen -- to be the 2013 version that had somehow reinstalled itself.<br /><br />I was frustrated. When I visited my Norton account, my new version did not appear, and all I saw that was recent was a trial purchase of Norton Online Backup. I began to wonder if I had purchased a fraudulent version of Norton Internet Security 2014 that was really a backup program.<br /><br />When I contacted Norton Support, via a Chat room, the Chat agent told me that this Amazon.com product must be fraudulent, and tried to persuade me to buy a $79 version of Norton Internet Security 2014 from Norton. I politely refused.<br /><br />The Norton Chat Agent then offered various concessions -- extended subscription length, etc. -- but remained firm that I must fork over between $30 to $79. That did not sound good.<br /><br />The Chat Agent -- no doubt following instructions -- also denied that I had seen a &#34;renewal&#34; window offering Norton 2014 for $19.99. He said it must be a fraudulent pop-up.<br /><br />He did try to help me, but he clearly had rigid instructions from management to &#34;upsell&#34; anyone who contacted Norton with updates downloaded from sites other than Norton itself.<br /><br />But I knew it wasn't a fraudulent pop-up, because my software kept flashing a &#34;renewal within 5 days before expiration&#34; message, as it has been doing every day.<br /><br />I finally told the Chat Agent I would try to fix things on my own, and if I couldn't, I'd find another provider. I'm on a budget.<br /><br />I finally thought: what if the Norton Internet Security 2013 and 2014 interfaces are very similar? And I do have the new program completely downloaded, as the Amazon.com window told me I did -- but I need to input the product key?<br /><br />So I went to &#34;Support&#34; on the Norton program's screen and clicked on &#34;Enter product key&#34; and input the product key -- and boom! -- all &#34;renew&#34; and &#34;expire&#34; notices disappeared.<br /><br />I returned to my online Norton account, and this program was finally shown as Norton Internet Security 2014.<br /><br />(The Norton Backup program appeared to be a trial gift I had received from my internet provider a year ago.)<br /><br />To summarize:<br /><br />1. Before you do anything else, check the settings on your old Norton program and write them down. You may have to re-input them in your new program.<br /><br />2. You may want to completely uninstall Norton's previous version yourself before downloading the new version.<br /><br />3.  After you have downloaded the new program purchased here, input your product key before you do anything else.<br /><br />I left a message for the Chat Agent explaining how I'd resolved the problem. I also suggested (politely) that Norton might want to reconsider how it treats its long-term customers."
3,"This is the 2nd year doing my taxes through Turbotax, previously did it through a CPA .  Anyone who can read and follow instructions can do this.....even a non- financial or accounting person can do this.  Some of the definitions or explanation when itemizing can be a bit confusing, but other than that no complaints.  I love Turbo tax.<br /><br />I wish they had the ability to e-file state without having to pay an additional $20.00.  For me this year I did not mind as I got Turbtax - deluxe 2013 at a great deal.....less than $40.00, with the retail price over $60.00, it was a great deal, even with the $20.00 state e filing fee."
1,"I purchased this in conjunction with the purchase of a new computer. After installing Quicken down loading my old files to the new CPU was extremely difficult and I spent considerable money for technical help to accomplish it.  Watching the experts work on this project and noticing the time it took, I wonder how Quicken expects the ordinary person to do this without help and spending money.  Their software team could do much more to make this a more simple task."
0,"We have been Quickbooks users and vendors for many years now, and despite a recent uptake in technical issues, predominantly network connectivity, it has been a fairly stable program. However, the most recent version (fully patched and updated) refuses to work, or accurately diagnose it's own problems. Spending hours on hold (again) with tech support every time we install this for either ourselves or clients is simply not possible. I am therefore compelled reluctantly to conclude that this product is no longer something that we can use or recommend to clients. Personally, I am always sad to see a company succeed to the level where it becomes apathetic, or deaf to the concerns of its client base, but it does appear that is where Intuit have arrived."
3,"Bought my first copy from Best Buy along with my computer. That was 4 years ago and it hasn't let me down yet. Seems to work quietly and efficiently in the background and was working very well with Windows 8 and Firefox. However, since I upgraded to Windows 10, I'm having issues with the Webroot/Firefox interface. I haven't contacted any company about this because I'm hoping it all works itself out :-)  Mostly problems with Firefox crashing several times when I try to log in to my password manager on the toolbar.<br />I needed to contact Webroot customer support once when I was having trouble renewing. I used email support, someone got back to me very quickly, told me what I needed to do and checked with me afterwards to make sure everything was okay. The experience was very good. I'm sticking with this software."
4,I like the way it tells me out loud that it is working for me. So far it has done a great job. I have avast! on my computer because I had to take it to the shop and they put it on. They really like it too.
3,"For many years I'd used Microsoft Security Essentials, as it did the job.  However, by early 2014, I'd noticed that increasingly often when I'd get performance issues, it would be MSE doing some sort of scan, and after the Windows XP retirement date, Security Essentials would stop working on my XP box whenever I tried to update it via Windows Update.  That convinced me to try the Kaspersky trial, and when it ended about 8 months ago, buy it via Amazon, where at the time the price was a very reasonable fifteen bucks.<br /><br />And it's been good.  I haven't had any performance problems with it, which makes it worth the price over MSE.  And, although it hasn't found any viruses - I typically only get one every 3-4 years - it has warned me of suspicious sites while browsing a couple times.  So all in all, I'd recommend it.  It's only because I don't put it to a strenuous test that I rate it 4 instead of 5 - I've yet to see it perform any miracles.<br /><br />The remaining likely question is, why go with a paid solution instead of a free one if the free ones are sufficient for catching the viruses you get?  I'd gone with free for years for this very reason.  Lower performance impact certainly is a factor.  But Kaspersky also does some pretty good security research and investigation (such as what's described at http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/how-omnipotent-hackers-tied-to-the-nsa-hid-for-14-years-and-were-found-at-last/).  For a pretty reasonable annual rate, I don't mind supporting them in that endeavour, and also getting a low-performance-impact, high-accuracy antivirus product in the process."
3,Some improvements but still needs some work.  Seems to be more stable than 2012 which was terrible and loaded with bugs.
4,great price compared to retail stores install was simple
2,"I'm a landlord and bought the software because it said that it was for landlords.  This is the forth year I bought Premier to do my taxes.  Now the IRS wants landlords to prepare a 1099-MISC for contractors over $600.  I never needed this form, but last year I put a new roof on my rental property so I need to do the form.  I was surprised that the Premier couldn't do it.  I called TurboTax and they upgraded me for free.  Next year if I need to do another 1099-MISC I will need to buy the Home and Business version. I think preparing 1099-MISC should be included in the Premier if it's for landlords."
1,"I upgraded from Quicken Premier 2010 to Premier 2013 due to the notice that they were going to shut off the online downloading in April.  The install went smoothly and it pulled my files with no problems.  My issue with the 2013 is that nothing changed.  It was just a ploy to get me to spend money on software so that I could continue to download MY information.  I was not interested in the mobile features.<br /><br />2013 really has no differences to the 2010 that I can see.  They did a little bit of cosmetic work, but you can still see how they didn't even do that completely as all the old looks are still readily visible.  There is no improvement in reporting.  Most importantly, I still get all the same issues with account downloading.  The account update will show errors updating some accounts when you do the batch update, but when you update individually from the account itself, it may or may not work.  My wife and I have multiple accounts at some institutions and Quicken regularly puts transactions in the wrong accounts - how can this be - they are different accounts!  For the price, there is still too much manual handling of information for me to have spent money to upgrade to nothing.  The reporting is still crap.  There are issues with old categories that won't go away - they always show up even when they are not selected.  There isn't even capabilities to force the reports onto a certain number of pages.  You can do lots with your information after you export it to excel and run your macro programs to make the reports readable - but that's what Quicken should be doing, that's why I spent the money!<br /><br />Overall, I am disappointed with Quicken 2013.  I felt they removed a service I purchased with 2010 to force an 'upgrade' to 2013; an upgrade which had no real upgrades to it."
1,"Rather than saying I don't like it, it just doesn't fit my need. It is well-designed software. My use doesn't fit.<br />My use would have been primarily for auto-downloading my stock portfolio closings on Saturdays when I do my weekly analyses. Quicken did not return accurate results. I had to double-check each stock, bond, etc for accuracy, then make changes.<br /><br />I checked it out for other areas, such as business financial statements, and I believe it will be better there. I think I can use it."
1,It is hard to navigate and figure out what is supposed to be entered where. More hassle than it's worth.
4,"Having been a Quicken user for many years, it was a natural move.  Although QuickBooks is more detailed, it was easy to make the change.  The detail and the reports are amazing. Is is great to customize the accounts to your business."
2,"This is a fair product, gets the job done for my needs, only a very small business with a few customers. I did like the installable version better but like the ability to access from any system."
4,A great product.  I get it every year.
0,I find no difference between it and the 2013 version.  One pet peeve is when writing checks it automatically reverts to sending on line and you must change it with every check you write.
2,do not use it
1,"It works ok. It is just slower by down loding it from the internet. My desk top Mac is lot quicker, I used a Microsoft disk."
3,"I use this program as a study tool to break up the monotony from rote memorization and approach the information from another way.  It works great for that, though I wish that it would keep track of which ones I got right and which ones I got wrong.  It wasn't its intended use, so I can't complain much.  Importing pictures is really awful for some reason, so assume you cant do it."
3,"I bought this product for my 6 year old daughter because it was too painful to watch her continue to 'peck' at the keyboard anytime she needed to type something.    She LOVES it.  After we got it, she actually begged me every day to play it.  Sometimes she would get frustrated because she wasn't getting enough right on the practice typing or the games would go to quickly, but that is just something that needs to be practiced.     One complaint is that it allows you to enter a target speed and it actually recommends you be at 14wpm in a section before you move on, but it doesn't seem to stop you from actually continuing on whether you meet that criteria or not.  So if you, as a parent, are not making sure they meet that goal, they can just keep going forward and perhaps end up too frustrated to continue learning at all.    My husband and I also had fun trying the product to see where our WPM was at and would actually have races against each other to see who could type faster.  It was fun. :)    I definitely recommend this product."
4,"Fusion 360 has completely changed my companies workflow. Although it does have it's quirks, Fusion is awesome and keeps getting better. The support from Autodesk is amazing and have helped us integrate some other services to keep us connected, working, and mobile. The apps are killer. Im not sure how I feel about the Cloud yet but it seems everything is heading that way. The Fusion team seem to really focus on education and keep developing the software into something great. New features are being added pretty regularly and have seen some great improvements in working with it the last few months. I picked up a second license just to have a personal account separate from work and really look forward to where this is headed. There are a few functions that i wish were easier to implement but they listen to their users and give the people what they want.<br /><br />You get industry standard software that is super powerful and pretty seamless."
4,"Pretty easy to use. I have only used it for basic video editing so far, when i get some more time i plan on trying out some other functions."
0,It didn't work
3,Just as described
4,"I have used TurboTax for several years and will continue. I filed my federal return the last of January, but, have not received notification that it was received and approved by fed."
4,"I'm on a MAC so any software you want to buy is horrendously expensive and lately PC's are not any better. It's really refreshing to find software that is free and really really works, I've bought a copy of iWorks and this is the most convoluted hunk of crap ever coded, it used to be pretty good but every update they close off more comparability and basically force you to use their formats and now takes 4 steps to even start a new doc and are forced to put it on their servers, REALLY?  Well I need to be able to use edit and send files in .doc and xls and convert .pps to jpegs and allot of other mundane tasks that should be easy and a no brainer. Well I can do all of that on Open office. Not only that, it includes software I've never had access to before. It's hard to learn but I've managed to set up a decent data base, that's something I'd never been able to do with MS Office or iWork."

4,"Working Flawlessly.<br /><br />I have been a Quicken user since 2005, migrating from MS Money.  I upgrade annually.  2014 (with patch update) is the best product to date.  The cloud sync with my Android is great...worth the price of the update alone!  I take photos of receipts, assign categories, and bingo, automatically transported to my computer (once synced).  This helps tremendously with budgeting...as small common purchases/receipts can slip out of my pocket (like change).<br /><br />I noticed a lot of bad reviews.  I don't know why.  Either they haven't installed the patch or...haven't figured out what they are doing.  It's a great piece of software, thus far working flawlessly.  I'm glad I've updated!"

I am not manually configuring all my transactions again in the 2015 version...So &#34;back to formula&#34;...uninstalled 2015 and re-installed 2009 and Voila, all my &#34;Detailed&#34; Transactions are perfectly showing. Needless to say, I completely wasted $180 getting 2015 version. In addition, the Online Support is a joke and the &#34;phone&#34; support is only slightly less of a joke. They came up with zero solutions. Thanks for nothing Intuit.  There's 4 hours of a beautiful Saturday I'll never get back."

1,I was a long time Microsoft Money user and I just liked it better than Quicken.  With some time it may become a little more user friendly.
1,"Bought it for $19.99 on Amazon. Seemed like a great deal and a great solution to my problem when the bundled Cyberlink PowerDVD10 on my laptop stopped support for new Bluray movies.  I don't know if I was duped, or what.  What I do know is this software played a Blu-ray Disc exactly one time.  The next time I tried to view multiple discs (including the same one) I received no such playback. I tried for days and got nowhere.  In order to get support online, you have to have a serial number and a support code. The latter of which is only available if you have purchased the software from the Corel site. I purchased from Amazon Digital.  I have an HP laptop dv7-6185us with all stock components.  Don't know if this happens in all HP's or just in WinDVD period. Reason it got 2 stars is b/c it does play DVD's for the most part and it has a cool feature for &#34;streamlining&#34; the video which increases the frame rate of the video for smoother appearance.  Other than that, such a waste of time. I assume that Corel will not be reading this review and I will get no help. I'm basically stuck with an older version of the software with no support for bluray codecs. Not sure how it worked the initial time I used it. I'm sure it was a mistake on the part of Corel.  Btw, the error, after it crashes and won't play a BD reads: &#34;WinDVD has stopped playback due to an AACS check error&#34; (only after I have manually ejected the disc).<br />***Also, it would not play a dual-sided TV on DVD disc, that surprisingly, Cyberlink will play, absolutely no problem."

0,I've been a &#34;PAID&#34;avast user for over 5 years.  Now that they have updated the program they spam my computer all day with their advertisements for additional purchases.  This is causing crashes that make me have to improperly shutdown and restart my computer several times just to complete simple task.
4,Great package for 2 software programs for a great price.
2,No real improvements over 2012 version.  But had to buy it because downloads from my bank and broker would no longer work with older version.
2,"Well, I wanted to wait till I used it long enough before reviewing.<br /><br />Pros<br />Better than Open Office which crashed constantly on me.<br /><br />Cons<br />It does not index anything. I never had a problem finding files/folders with older versions of purchased Word.<br />I cannot find a folder at all when searching.<br />I cannot find files 99% of the time.<br />I get this a lot &#34;files cannot be loaded&#34; yet I click on the dia box and they load<br />The border feature does not work most of the time<br />Page number feature is greyed out most of the time.<br /><br />I wrote down my issues on s Microsoft forum but did not get a reply.<br /><br />It seems the price is higher and you get less but you get more aggravation. We need more options than Open Office and Microsoft."
4,easy install and looks great.  Love just buying the download and having all info stored on amazon.

0,"This long-time user of Quicken (more than 10 years) HATES this upgrade.  Sadly, I waited a 6 days too long to ask for a refund -- I was trying to adapt and find workarounds for favorite features lost (especially Loan Center).<br />The new features are NOT intuitive, the new windows aim for a \\""different\\"" look but only decrease function.<br />I'm going back to Quicken 2012, and sending word of my disappointment to Intuit."

2,"After used HRB for tax year 2011, I's say I prefer TurboTax.  I bought HRB simply because TurboTax was too expensive.  Comparing two software, I found that TurboTax's interview was more relevant to the forms I was going to fill out.  When filling out forms, TurboTax's format was THE form so that I knew which box I was looking for value.  In addition, State is not needed if you live in MA.  MA webfile is free."
1,The software did not have the updates for the Obama Healthcare forms and kept giving incomplete errors follow by a msg to call H& R Block.<br />I called H&R block and waited 1 1/2hours for them to come on the phone line only for them to say they did not have a updated fix. They suggested I bring my taxes to them and pay them to do my taxes after I bought their software. Shame on H&R Block.
0,I tried so many times. Called the manufacturer and they tried to assist. For whatever reason I could not get this to download for me. Would always stall out. I was bummed because I loved my last Norton product.
3,"I understand all the hate with Turbo tax taking away features and i would be upset as well.  However for my simple needs this worked just fine.  I did take advantage of HRBlock giving away free copies of software.  I ended up using both and to be honest i felt they were both really same, easy to use.  So if i ever decided or Turbotax makes me leave, going to HRblock would be an easy transition."
0,"Unbeknownst to most, me included, TurboTax moved many of the schedules and forms that I had been using for years in &#34;Deluxe&#34;  to the more expensive &#34;Premier&#34; version.  They sent out a letter after hearing from so many irate customers saying that they would offer a $25 rebate after you spend $30 to upgrade.  Recently, they told me over the phone that there will be a free upgrade coming out in early February due to the uproar from so many customers.  We'll wait and see.  They also said that they would be going back to the old functionality of Deluxe in 2015."
3,This was recommended to me by a tech savy friend and it does what it says.Especially because it is free.
0,"I ordered thinking it would be better than word... wrong. Oh well I guess you learn by trying... The program started off great, it uploaded my old resume and after 3 hours or re configuring and re wording thinking I was making progress it would not allow me to save saying I lost connection or something like that?? I was a bit angry to say the least. So not recommending this as Word is much better and less clunky."
3,It's been a great software to switch to after MS dumped Money!!
0,One state is NOT included in the price. Filing instructions are unclear and instruct you to mail things in even if you supposedly e-filed.
2,"It does the job, but you do need to know what you're doing – help is sparse. Hard to beat the value, though."
0,"&#34;Phone home&#34; software which constantly wants to be validated online.  Regret having paid for the 2015 upgrade; previous versions weren't quite so obtrusive.  Will not give Chief any additional business on this point alone.  Otherwise, this edition (&#34;Pro&#34;) is adequate, but overly expensive for the feature set.  Roofing is particularly tricky, and electrical is woefully inadequate.  Stability has improved over previous versions, but crashing is still an issue.  Dimensioning has also improved, but it's still painfully difficult to measure and add interior dimensions in many cases."
0,"I had a lot of trouble with turbo tax this year. After what you guys did this year, I will never buy another Intuit product!"
0,Been a user since the DOS days .... this version pretty much sucks ... new features don't work ... things that work one day don't work the next ... the interface to mobile is spotty at best ... in other words I spent a lot of money and only got headaches ... oh and Intuit no longer gives any phone support instead they expect the users to support each other - nice they take the money and then you all support each other .... they will reluctantly do a live chat if your lucky .... I currently have a feature dealing with my investments I use everyday and really need stopped working and I can't figure out why .... BTW I am retired from computer work so if you don't have a computer background lots of luck .... I will be changing to something else
2,"I am pleased with the software.  I can do most things with it, but I can not customize the house the way I would like.  It owuld be great to download added appliances, furniture, etc.  It comes with the basics, but when designing a dream home who really wants basics?"
1,Product was captioned &#34;Norton 360 2013 antivirus&#34; as if it's good for almost a year or 360 days. I bought one a year ago which was good for a year for 3 PCs.<br />If the misleading name for the brand is meant to trick customers into buying the antivirus then I have a message for you all: you will soon lose the majority of your consumers if not all. Thank you<br /><br />Robert Amihere<br />rohere5k@yahoo.ca
2,"Generally product is OK. This doesn't include State-E-filing.<br />I bought from Amazon because it says 40% off. I usually done it from TurboTax online.<br />When I find out I have to pay 24.99 for State Tax efiling, I felt I'm cheated. I reviewed product page again and it says I have to pay extra cost for state - efiling. Online, I pay when I complete it. Once I pay the extra charge for State e filing, I don't think 40% discount is right. How much online charge for federal and state with efilining?<br /><br />I used to like Turbotax, but I don't like it after the experience that I couldn't change back to Deluxe after selecting Premier by accident without registering and loosing all the previous data. However, I couldn't find any good alternative."
1,"I think TT works on Federal is ok, but TT has been messed up my state returns twice (2012/2013). I don;t trust it for state any longer.<br /><br />This year, it messed up my 2nd state income, which found by my wife, could cause us 300 loss in refound; last year, it selected the low-income table for us...<br /><br />What a mess it is!"
0,"I've been using Quicken for years.  I have 6 accounts:  Bank, money market, misc charges, Individual Brokerage, Traditional IRA, Roth IRA.  I bought iBank 3 weeks ago & it still is not working properly.  It states you can download fro Quicken for Mac or Quicken for PC.  The only way you can get help is via email.  The person I have had helping me still gives me instructions for Quicken MAC.  I was able to set up 5 of my account.  The last account freezes & kicks me out every time I try to add or download anything.  I was told there is no limit to number of transaction.  I was asked last week to secure email my info via their specialized transfer form.  The lady was unable to get down what I needed &  I was finally referred to QA on Monday.  QA came back initially on Monday night  there was no problem.  I emailed back Tuesday and asked if they had all my info as there are now 2 iBank account as the origin; adviser had me redo the process a different way with the one account.  Today is Thursday & still no response.  I am probably too sophisticated for iBank to keep up with.     I cannot return it as I bought via Amazon versus via their website which has a 30 day free trial.  UPDATE:   The regular technician began to have the same problem I did.  I must admit once iBank admitted there was a problem they fixed it in less than 48 hours.  If you have a great deal of data, iBank may truncate it and or just refuse to download.  That is why a senior technical advisor supervisor had to load & combine my accounts manually.    Site is working beautifully now.  I'd update my rating if I could."
1,"I bought the download when it was a much better deal than it is now.  I replaced Avast with this program.  I have a 3-PC home network with a Seagate Central 3TB NAS.  Kaspersky essentially disconnected the backup drive by interfering Seagate's Management software and making it look like it wasn't on the network. With some work, I got my Windows 8.1 laptop working.  I spent a day on the phone with Seagate TS and had a short call to Kaspersky TS.  Seagate worked hard to make the drive function.  Kaspersky's phone person spent time denying it was a problem.  They did send an unhelpful email suggesting things to try and I got even more helpful emails after I emailed them and told them I'd removed the software from two PC's and replaced it with Avast.  My backup is working like a charm.  But, I've ended up cleaning the drive so I have no historical backups and got to waste 30+ hours.  Fine software  for a PC.  Anything out of the ordinary and they are no help."
2,"This version of Office needs an update to be competitive. It doesn't allow you to synchronize the Outlook Calendar with iCloud, which is a mission-critical feature for me, so I've stopped using Outlook and gone back to Apple Mail and BusyCal. If you don't absolutely need it for producing proprietary MS-format documents, I'd skip it in favor of other solutions."
3,Efficient and straightforward
4,Have been using Avast for a couple years and have been pleased with their free antivirus.  Works in the background without taking up too much processor speed.
2,Quicken itself is fine but if you have a question or need a service its really difficult to deal with them. I found their chat system has really improved things and this tool makes dealing with Quicken much much better.
4,"I would never have been able to afford the full price but this is a great product. After years of using free .pdf readers/writers, I don't know why I waited so long to get this. You can r&r individual pages in complex documents. Easily convert from Word to .pdf and vice versa.  You can combine multple .pdf's into one giant one. Short learning curve."
0,"In addition to the removed Schedules mentioned thousands of times, there are more features missing. I've always used direct deposit to get both of my refunds, Fed - e-file, State - mail in (to save $19.99). This year, I find that somehow state refund type is set to MAIL A CHECK instead of direct deposit, and now way to go back and fix it. I'm locked out.<br />Is this a way intuit treats their loyal customers?<br />I'm officially done with TT."
2,"I have used Quicken for many, many years, first for Windows, and then for Mac.  First, the Mac version has never come up to the Windows version, and now, with the latest version, I've had the program crash on me 4 or 5 times when I try to manually match transactions.  These are my finances we're talking about and I would freak out if I didn't have access.  Other than that, it works OK."
4,"recommended by the computer shop after I had my lap top issues resolved, Avast is what they use and recommend"
0,"I was so excited to get this anti-virus software.  I did all my research, read all the reviews, including the one on PCMag which gave Webroot its Editor's Choice Award.  Then, the minute I downloaded this software, the nightmare began.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying that I wish I could crawl into a time machine and set the dial for the exact moment in time prior to my purchase of Webroot.  Barring this, no other way exists for me to ever retrieve the wasted hours of my life I spent dealing with this program -- not to mention the time I am now spending writing this magnum opus painstakingly detailing my nightmarish journey.  That time is gone forever.  The only thing I can do is warn others of my experience.  Hopefully someone will benefit from my pain.<br /><br />I strongly caution anyone against purchasing this program unless you have an extremely strong constitution coupled with the patience of Mother Theresa.  If that is you, I wish you Godspeed.  Just don’t neglect to gird your loins in preparation for the uphill battle that awaits you.<br /><br />COMPUTER SLOWDOWNS AND FREQUENT CRASHES:  Not long after downloading this program, my computer slowed down, and I noticed delays between my keyboard and mouse and my computer.  My computer kept freezing up and I could not unfreeze it via the task manager because the cursor was frozen, as well, so I had to perform hard shutdowns.  Then I would reboot my computer and the same thing would happen again.  Although my computer (six years old) would occasionally freeze or stop responding, after downloading Webroot, the change was profound.  It was happening so often I could get nothing done.<br /><br />WEBROOT’S RESPONSE:  I called Webroot and spoke to an extremely surly tech who sounded like I had just awoken him from a nap.  I had to ask him to speak up because he spoke in a barely audible mumble  that clearly conveyed I was inconveniencing him by my call.  My questions would be met by absolute silence -- not just the brief pause one would expect from someone preparing to deliver a thoughtful response -- but more like the Silence of the Lambs – silences so profound and prolonged that I was forced to ask him if he were still on the line.  He told me Webroot wasn’t the cause and that it must be my computer.  Following my conversation with him, I did some online research and found lots of reviews by people who reported the same issue, so it couldn’t have just been my computer out of millions.  Too bad I hadn’t done that beforehand, instead of relying on the “experts.”<br /><br />FAILED TO BLOCK MALICIOUS PROGRAM FROM DOWNLOADING ONTO MY COMPUTER:  I went to a website that had free software and accidentally downloaded a program that turned out to be malware.  I didn’t intend to download this program.  I may have inadvertently clicked on something.  I don’t know.  But somehow it began downloading and running on my computer and I couldn’t stop it.  I went to the control panel and attempted to delete the program, but it would not let me do so.  Instead, it would ask me if I would allow it to make changes to my computer.  I was forced to say yes hoping the “changes” it intended to make were to uninstall it, but of course that wasn’t the case.  It probably just downloaded more crap and poured more and more malicious code onto my system.  Now, mind you, all this it did WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A MURMUR OF PROTEST FROM WEBROOT!!  Contrary to its own documentation (available online) which states that in the event Webroot encounters a suspicious program, it will prompt the user and warn against downloading anything from that site.  Barring that, if Webroot fails to block the virus or malicious program from breaching its security, it is supposed to recognize and quarantine the program so that it doesn’t then go on a rampage, raping and pillaging everything in its path.  In my case, none of the above occurred.  On the contrary, the program downloaded without a hitch.  Afterwards, my system began freezing and crashing like crazy.  And if I thought things had been  bad before, I was grossly mistaken.  Finally, the problem was resolved by my operating system and not by Webroot.  My operating system intervened when I had booted it up for the umpteenth time and ran Check Disk.  I watched as Check Disk ran and read what it was doing.  It was deleting corrupt files, and checking security descriptors.  At one point through all of this, Webroot flashed a notice that it had “removed  a threat.”  Really Webroot?  Not a moment too soon.  Like some fat, lazy security guard who ambles onto the scene of a crime after a civilian bystander has taken down the thug.  Thanks a lot.<br /><br />WEBROOTS’S RESPONSE:  Webroot said that it cannot block all programs from downloading because people call them and complain that programs they specifically want to download are blocked.<br /><br />PASSWORD MANAGER PROBLEMS FROM HERE TO DOOMSDAY:  First, the password manager extension didn't appear on my toolbar.  Spoke to someone in tech support who was very nice and helped me to fix it.  Called again because I was trying to use the password manager and it wouldn't work with a lot of the websites I tried to save.  Initially I thought it was me because I'm not very computer-savvy.  So I went over everything with the tech (who was also very nice) and he walked me through everything until I was sure I understood how to use it.  Then, when I tried working with it on my own, I found out what a horrendous, buggy program it is.  I saved dozens of sites to the password manager that seemed to be working fine.  Then when I would later go and click on them, Webroot would react strangely, sometimes taking me to the site and not filling in the login and password, sometimes only filling in part of the password, etc.  I tried re-saving the login/password info for these sites numerous times. I literally spent hours doing this. The password manager would say it detected a change in the password and when I clicked on confirm, it would either just capture the first character of the new password, or run okay but continue to prompt me that it detected a change in the password every time I logged onto that site.  There were at also numerous sites that I couldn't even get the password manager to work with at all, despite trying again and again, ad nauseam.<br /><br />WEBROOT’S RESPONSE:  I was told by one person in sales/customer support that he used the password manager on his own computer all the time and that it worked great.  He referred me to the online documentation, which I assured him I had already read.  By that point, I was all too familiar with the ins and outs of the password manager feature.  He still found this difficult to believe.  Next I spoke to tech support and was told basically the same thing, that it could not be Webroot that was at fault, but that I must be doing something wrong.  He said that Webroot is the number one software on the market, so I guess then it couldn’t be them.  I invited him to remotely access my computer and check it out for himself.  When he did so, he was surprised that, indeed, things weren’t working so great.  He then proceeded to tell me it must be my computer that wasn’t working well.  I asked him what could possibly be happening on my computer that would cause an internet toolbar extension to malfunction?  He threw  out a few ideas, like maybe I had hardware issues, or another program was interfering with the password manager.  I invited him to look at my programs and see if he could find something that might be conflicting with Webroot and he could not.  NOTE:  Afterwards, I read reviews by others who were treated in like manner.  Apparently Webroot has the attitude that it’s product is perfect and that if the user encounters problems with its software, it must be their fault.<br /><br />ATTEMPT TO GET A REFUND:  Since I purchased this product on Amazon, I was unable to get a refundbecause of Amazon’s policy.  I told Webroot that I wanted a refund from them and was told they couldn’t do so because I hadn’t purchased the product from them.  But surely they had sold the product to Amazon who then sold it to me, right?  So in essence they did sell me the program.  At any rate, I was so disgusted I just wanted to get rid of the damn thing.<br /><br />MY LAST CONTACT WITH WEBROOT:  I grew finally frustrated with one tech and asked to be connected to a supervisor.  I waited and waited.  The line rang, and I thought the supervisor was going to pick up.  Instead, I HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO SOMEBODY’S VOICEMAIL!!  I was livid.  I talked to yet another tech and was again told I couldn’t get a refund.  After he had been dealing with me for awhile which, granted, could not have been pleasant by that point, he threw out that I could just get a refund.  When I said that I had been told that was not possible, he insisted that it was.  So conflicting information on top of everything else.  At that point, it was just the icing on the cake.  He told me the my issues about the password manager would be “escalated” to another tech support department who would check on things “from the back end.”  They were supposed to email me the results of their findings by today.  As of this writing, I have heard nothing from them except an email telling me they were going to look into it.  Great.  I was told over the phone that they would have already looked into it by today and gotten back to me.  Buyer beware."
1,"A testament to modern software development. It's new, it's different, and that about sums up the positive attributes.<br /><br />Scaling in Windows 8.1 on high resolution screens is laughable. Riddled with buttons so small I can barely distinguish them from a smudge. Quicken will blame windows, but most of my other programs (often free or significantly less expensive) avoid these issues so it's pretty clear who is to blame. I have to change the resolution for my entire windows experience just to get this one program to look slightly less horrible.<br /><br />A frequent occurrence: Press a button and notice that nothing is happening...at all...not even a spinning icon to tell you to be patient. Perhaps 20 seconds later the screen flickers and you think, &#34;Ah! You ARE doing something!&#34; Eventually, a new window appears or a belated spinning icon confirms your vague suspicion that your trackpad is indeed still working. This on a brand new ultrabook where every other program flies.<br /><br />It happened to me yesterday: I want to change my Wells Fargo username. How can I do this? Perhaps a button in my account settings that says, &#34;Change Username&#34;? Oh no, silly, you need to begin by disconnecting your accounts from their ability to download transactions. Only then can you reconnect them and have an opportunity to give a different username. It's about like being told my front door is just fine because while there is no knob to open it, one can easily remove the hinges and gently lower it to the floor in order to exit the building.<br /><br />It happened to me...again: This isn't new to 2015, it's just the way Quicken has always been. I've had the product for just a few months and suddenly I'm facing numerous duplicate transactions and the familiar question, &#34;They are both identical, so which one do I need to kill in order to keep it from coming back?&#34; Operating this software is like spoon feeding a gremlin. You can try to be nice, be gentle, move slowly and try to avoid eye contact, but eventually it's going to spit food on the wall and try to bite your fingers off. Ha! And you have to pay for the privilege!<br /><br />My question: Is the software development at Intuit in a state equivalent to overseas clothing sweatshops? At a time when software can be amazing, how can a product like this be so woefully disappointing except by a stringent commitment to spending money on advertising rather than development, and making sure those developers are the cheapest money can buy (possibly to the point of being exploitive)?"

2,"Running on a Parallels VM in Mac OS snow leopard and definitely experience stability issues. I use the budget function heavily (upgraded frm 2011) and there is heavy update there, but geared toward the person who probably didn't use budgeting previously. (Eg, I aggregate personal expenses on multiple categories for multiple businesses I operate...usually by a journal entry in my primary checking account. This version doesn't recognize a net zero journal as a transaction and doesn't pull the category amounts into the budget actual numbers. Easy enough to work around, but a pain to update 5 months of daily JEs to get my 2014 budget to read properly.)<br />All in all, not the best intuit update I've seen, but certainly FAR from the worst (some of the POS updates in the last 5 years were heinous)."

So during the install it wanted to uninstall it and upgrade my data files which actually have about two years of data (stopped using for a couple years as it was taking too much time to manage plus trying to manage the XFERs always seems to be a chore in Quicken).  I selected the advanced install and created a  new directory like Quicken2010 away from the old directory just to prevent any problems with dll hell.  The uninstall took quite some time, but I did see the cpu bouncing around and disk drive light going on and off at times.  I noticed in Task Manager msizap.exe  using the cpu.  Eventually the install and upgrade of data files finished.    Upon entering Quicken 2010, I setup my various accounts.  It then downloaded transactions.   Upon entering the accounts to accept the new transactions, it had downloaded transactions from last 90 days and matched only one or two transactions that I had all ready entered (ugh).  I had to delete all those transactions manually (ugh).  It is a nice feature to download right into Quicken and not have to do the file import routine.    I wrongly assumed I could pay bills from Quicken.  That Quicken service costs $9.95 (ugh).    It looks like there's new life planning center, different budget (spending planner) and different tax center.  I never used tax center, but that looks like something to check out.       I will try to report back as to other experiences."
1,"This is a problem that you will find in the online reviews for Quicken 2014 and other recent years of Quicken.  So why doesn't intuit fix it? I guess they must not be that much into it.<br /><br />The issue is that the &#34;print scaling&#34; feature (i.e., fit the report onto one page in width) is locked out on printing of reports, so if you print it, it prints on multiple pages horizontally/wide (in addition to the multiple pages of length if applicable),  Hence, the need for lots of paper, tape and big tables to read your reports.<br /><br />The problem is present for many printers (I tried 3 different ones) and even after trying all of Intuit's feeble online recommendations for self-help (uninstall and reinstall Quicken, try deleting various files, uninstall printers, reinstall printers and drivers, trial and error experimentation to see if drivers for other printers might work on your printer).....nothing.  You shouldn't have to waste this much of your time on such a basic functionality.<br /><br />So, it's pretty hard to recommend a program that has a stubborn issue like this on a basic utility, where the software manufacturer seems to be ignoring it and hoping you just go away.  That attitude has led to the demise of many others who thought their monopoly would last forever."
2,MS doesn't tell you that if you have 2 factor authentication turned on that you cannot activate Office 365.  You have to turn it off every time you want to install and activate a new computer.  What a bummer.  Typical for MS though.
1,i first tried the trial version worked exccelent purchased full version slow as you know what nothing as promised i doesn't even have the burner like the free version i don't reccomend it

1,"I have been using q b for over 10 years  and customer service is getting more and more challenging<br /><br />I upgraded to 2014 because qb 2012 would not e mail on windows 8 ,<br />C.S said to get the  2014 release and it will  resolve your issues<br />after going thru 4 dept on 3 separate  days  , continually asking , pleading for them  to read the case note (as an aside I was told tech support does not have my notes ) today I was told &#34;this is a known issue and when we have the new release we will upload it &#34; till then I can not do a pdf , I e mail one invoice then it stops working and i have to call for support  and now I am on hold to speak to a supervisor for over 45 min update 55 min"
0,"I am really disappointed by this product. Its mobile sync (the primary reason why I upgraded) is terribly buggy. I've been through two upgrade cycles (to R2 and R3), and the sync still does not work fully. I can tell Intuit is trying to respond, but I am shocked at their inability to solve this problem. Secondly, the budget features, though labeled as \\""improved\\"", work very differently than before; the differences broke the way that I've been budgeting, and I've had to completely redo my budgets. The third problem with the software is that the transaction register is much slower than before. It can take 3-5 seconds for an entry in the register to save; during this time Quicken is unresponsive. Technical support blamed it on the size of my file, but I didn't have this problem with the previous version of Quicken I used."
0,"I just discovered that this garbage, in spite of its huge fan base, has cost me thousands of dollars in unclaimed exemptions over the past five years. The worst is the state version. I lost 1200 tax reduction each year because it didn't notify about available exemptions."
0,Not able to download it!! Horrible
0,"Very unsatisfied. No customer service help. Tried it and not very easy to use. Nothing I touch in the program works, no way to cancel and get you money back. Do not waste your money"
0,"I'm a 19-year Quicken customer who relies deeply on the budgeting feature. Simply put, 2013 has been a disaster for me after upgrading for 2011.<br /><br />I know the interface is new - fine - but the budget views within the planning window literally can't distinguish between Income and Expenses ... though there are categories labeled as such, Quicken adds them all up as Income, rather than Income minus Expense. There are double budget line entries (not the mere topline and subtotals, but actual subcategories appearing twice).<br /><br />I've found myself having to manually add up the budget categories to get a budget over/under evaluation. That's ridiculous for financial software.<br /><br />I'm left contemplating an uninstall and trying to revert back to 2011. Very frustrated, and I'm not easily frustrated."
2,"The previous version I had 2012 was easier to use. With this new one I had to redo all my onestep update banks. The instructions for doing were very unclear, I had to end up calling customer service. All had to be uninstalled and reinstalled.  I wish Quicken would leave it alone and just charge me every three years."
1,"As with all Quicken products, they keeps adding features that not needed and in some cases not provided to the customer.  I have used Quicken since the late 1990's and found this to be true with each new release of their software.  I quit purchasing Quicken in 2001, but needed to make a decision when Windows XP support ended.  I decided to purchase the 2014 version in order to maintain a contiguous record of my finances.  I do have to say that the Quicken web-site did provided support for converting from the old 2001 format to the new 2014 format, which included the software tools to do just that.  For that reason, I gave them an additional star.  I am in the process of searching for a Quicken replacement."
0,Purchased French 1 today and downloaded. Will not come up on my mac book pro running 6.8.6. No way to get any help. Worthless. Should have gotten it on CD I guess. No support available from Amazon or Rosetta.
0,Free isn't really free.  Way to many catches and hoops to jump through.  Had to renew my &#34;not free&#34; Norton instead
4,"Product came as described, DOWNLOADING WAS EASY!"
2,Thanks to avast free antivirus program for keeping my computer safe from hackers. I am a retired teacher with limited income and this software is helpful. The reason I am giving this rating is that free version has limited benefits and vendor keep sending message to purchase this software. Thanks.
0,This product did not work with new version of firefox. Do not buy this. You will waste your money and Amazon does not allow any refund. I had probelm since day one and called  Norton support four times. They can't help me at all.
0,TurboTax user for 20 years.....now their greed has pushed me to H&R Block
1,"Long time user, first time commenter...I couldn't resist.  I run the Windows 7 operating system.<br /><br />Unlike many of those commenting, I only updated my Quicken when they sent me the email that says \\""If you don't convert now, your data won't transport to the next version.\\""  This time I didn't wait that long, much to my sadness.  The added features do not warrant the reinvestment in a new version.<br /><br />My first experience with Q'13 was a splash screen that invites me to see new features and get a tour if I click below....there is no place below or anywhere else to click.<br /><br />The conversion of my old data from Q'11 wasn't fully correct.  I had an old, closed out brokerage account reestablish itself as an active account in Q'13.  I had a heck of a time developing a work around to get the long sold securities out of the reestablished account.<br /><br />I am not, by any means, a power-user of Quicken even though I've had it for double digit years...maybe '96 or so.  I really don't need all the bells and whistles that they keep adding and the annoying changes they make.  I need a checking/savings function and an investments function.  I like the bill pay and downloading from  my credit card companies, banks and investment firms. Maybe it's time for Quicken to create two versions of the software - one for us Keep It Simple folks and one for those who need or want the advanced functions.<br /><br />They also need a help line/help email feature, so when the software doesn't work we can get answers for free.<br /><br />Bottomline: I dabbled with Microsoft Money for a while.  Quicken was better.  I'll keep buying Quicken, but I'm going back to the \\""If you don't convert now, your data won't transport\\"" pattern of buying future versions."
2,"Good - storage space. easy of loading, but need better interface to view pictures, better ability to search, sort and file."
0,"Non-stop, relentless spam! I have asked three times to end the spam. They just laugh with a &#34;what are you going to do about it&#34; attitude. Worse yet, we made the mistake of ordering it online two years ago. Since then, they have placed three charges on our card. They claim that we opted in for all future products and updates they deem necessary. I asked to see where that happened, on what page, what check box, where was my authorization. I am very aware of little scams like that and would have never opted into a &#34;charge me what ever you want, when ever&#34; attitude. They were never able to show me where I opted into this. (They call it a &#34;service&#34;, most people call is credit card fraud). We finally had to change our credit card number to stop the fraudulent charges. We filed complaints with the Attorney General and FTC last year but our tax payer supported consumer protections serviced don't seem to work."

4,"It's MS Office, It's what I needed."
4,"I am new to design software and was a little worried about the learning curved involved with this product. Yes, it does take some time to learn how to use. I found it easiest to work my way through a project and then go back and try a more complicated design after I had used it a few times. I really like how you can insert furniture, artwork, and even vehicles. It's really gives you a sense of how much space you have."
1,"I purchased the product for an instant download. This was the start of hours of trying to get the product downloaded and failing. The issue is that although the Amazon.com portion of the download works fine what it downloads is the downloader for the actual product, which comes from the manufacturer.<br /><br />If THAT download is interrupted it will insist on starting at the very beginning again. Since the file is VERY large it was taking over an hour to download it and I had to make something like 30 attempts to finally get it downloaded before I got it.<br /><br />I think this is unconscionable for a company this large selling a product that large for downloading. Code has been around for many years that allows downloads to be restarted from the point where they left off."
3,"Had a bit higher expectations of some of the new features, but it was a good upgrade nonetheless.  It just seems sometimes &#34;new features&#34; are just old features called something different and with a new UI.  ;-)"
0,I could not download the software. I guess the price is to good to be true. I went to other sites but they $60 for a download and I thought this would be hassle free like all the other products I have bought from Amazon. This was very disappointing but at least it was just $20.
3,"Arrived on-time and worked well as usual.  Bought this as I have for several years.  Each year it seems to get a little easier to use. Noticed that this year the Fed-to-State transition was easier, and there were fewer decisions to make. Also seemed to be less confusion about changing my final version, and checking for the inevitable mistakes.  I do long form with schedules, so manuvering through them sometimes gets cumbersome.  This year, the format changed, and it was easier to find the areas that needed tweaking or correcting."
3,I rate things on a scale of 1 to irked.<br />Avast is fine...
3,Does what you expect it to do
2,Not much of an upgrade over 2013. I bought this edition hoping I could batch-import invoices but it does not offer many options. Overall good program just wish the Mac version would support 3rd party software like the windows version.
3,"My Quicken 2013 died thanks to a virus, so I thought I'd download 2014 and use it instead. Now I had been using Quicken Deluxe, but didn't use most of the program's features, such as investment tracking. So, I thought I'd just use Quicken Basic, because that's all I needed. After paying for the download and installing it, the program says I can't use Basic because I had previously used Deluxe! So, $39 later, I have Deluxe and have paid for a Basic I can't use.  After this review was published, Quicken contacted me to tell me about their unconditional money back guarantee of satisfaction. I'm taking advantage of it and kicking my stars up to 4 based on the Quicken Deluxe 2014 performance."
4,"I've installed this product on countless computers, removing the big company named anti-virus packs. This product has resolved many more issues than the others ever could."
4,Nice just as advertised everything I needed without the cost of the full blown version of Sony Sound Forge.
1,This is terrible!  I bought this product because the title said it included State tax filing.  It does not--at the very last screen you need to add your credit card for the $19.99 fee!!  Very deceptive.
2,"I bought this version because I lost everything on my old computer, including Quicken.  I do not like the choices for navigating different functions.  It seems like I have to search for everything.  Why not have more buttons with choices like \\""Reconcile\\""?  I liked the earlier version better."
1,"As a very long time user of quicken I've become increasingly frustrated with the decreasing quality of their products over the years.  Premier 2015 has the most number of bugs than any piece of software that I use.  I don't know what is going on over at Intuit, but the QA has to be awful and the engineering worse.  I hope someone buys them out.  I've been using Quicken for over 10 years."
3,Good check out up dated  Version much renew every few years  but good one of the best  Many computer owners recommend this product for pc protection
3,Very easy to use and install.
2,Unable to sync with my IPAD.  Don't know why.  Would like to contact customer service for Quicken for help.  No phone number available.
2,As others have mentioned some people are having problems trying to get Turbotax to start after the download.  I was one of those..  I uninstalled the product... installed the most recent version of .Net Framework 4.5.1 from the Microsoft website... downloaded the product again and it worked fine.  Sounds like something Turbotax should be aware of by now...  I love their product but am giving it 3 stars because of the download issue.
4,Good.
4,"Before Avast, I had AVG free antivirus. I was pleased with AVG up until I got a bad virus. AVG reported everything was fine but I knew that something was wrong with my computer. So I took a chance on Avast and it found and removed it right away. I also like that the Avast free version is a complete antivirus program. I found with AVG that they give you a basic antivirus program, but if you get something beyond the scope of the basic program, it will cost you. I will never have another antivirus program."
2,The product does not download all of my stock quotes leaving some of them out dated.
4,It's reliable and lets me know daily that it's working with a friendly voice.It was easy to install and reasonably priced<br />and I can recommend it.
1,"This might have been a decent tax software, I like the layout, but I'm having a lot of issues with fields being too short. Seems like an unnecessary limitation. The same information that used to fit in the TurboTax software doesn't fit here, which complicates things and eventually made me go back to TurboTax, even though I had already bought this one."
3,"Was most satisfactory and very configurable in a pinch for my 32-bit XP, 32-bit Vista Basic, and 64-bit Win7 machines! The only concern was the 'network protection' feature which I had suspected of occasionally (but momentarily) warm-booting my DSL routers, but this was configurable, too!  Doesn't required online accounts like NORTON, but doesn't have the PC maintenance features of Norton 360 which I am accustomed to.  Plan to switch over to the registered version of AVAST FREE ANTIVIRUS following my current NORTON 360 subscription later this year!"
1,"Like every program I've tried in the last 20 years, this one does not live up to the hype. I bought this because I flip houses for a living so I like to make a fast drawing of my house and then place furniture around to see how it will look. Usually I knock out a few walls.and come up with a better layout. Yes it does that, but I cant even find how to change the height of a bay window. The furniture is so basic, I must be doing something wrong because it sounds like I am supposed to have access to all kinds of catalogs and thousands of pre installed furniture designs. I can't find where this is. (I'm not an idiot, I've looked at the help, search, and manual, and online video.) Yes you do get a pretty detailed manual unlike sone of the other programs I've tried. I can't find how to change kitchen base cabinets from regular doors to drawers. Yes these are all basic but they don't; give the option when you click on the cabinet where the options are. My view of the plan from outside looks like I'm floating on some mountain, who knows why. So iwith all this said, I still came up with a usable layout, and that part is pretty easy but the rest is all a lie as far as I'm concerned. (they will probably say if you read or clicked on some link all this would be solved, believe me I tried) the moral? Try to find a full trial version to see if it can work for you before you spend money on it. Although you still waste hours learning the program."
3,I have used TurboTax for lots of years. It is a good product.
2,"I like this antivirus protection, except I want something that takes care of my pop-ups."
4,Very fast and convenient! This software walks you through all the scenarios and lets you know exactly what info you need to enter to get maximum refund. Takes all the guesswork out!
1,"There was something wrong with the site the application half downloaded then would repeatedly bring up error messages, when I tried to reinstall the app it said there was already another instance running on my computer. I called the support number they tried to tell me that it was my computer, I build computers and install operating systems and software  almost on a daily basis it was not my computer. avast tried to charge me 119 dollars to fix their mess I fixed it myself and I will never use another one of their products."
2,Useable...Stand Intuit stuff...but I did save money!
0,"Absolutely impossible to install. There is no way to call Adobe for help. When I tried to use chat, nobody ever answered. When I finally got help from some guy in India, he said &#34;Adobe doesn't provide phone support for that product.&#34;"
1,"I bought this because it was exactly what I was needing and the reviews sounded great.  After buying it, you have to figure out where to find the manual and once you do, endless, boring directions, not based on the visual learner, is what I found.  I ended up printing out 23 pages, to learn how to use it.  I ended up buying Creately and love the drop and drag features, which is for free to try out without giving any of your personal info, just play and see if it's right for you.  While MindMaple was a great price, what it delivers is not worth the money in my opinion."
2,"I did run into a problem, there was absolutely no one representative to help. In the long run it probably cost me a few bucks. Doubt if I'll use it again."
3,This worked just fine.
2,It runs for a while and says it is optimizing my computer but I haven't seen any changes in speed.  May work for others but I wouldn't say it made much difference for me.
3,"I was looking for the version for anime studio 9 and was excited when I found it!  I downloaded it and worked through it. Most lessons have a video of the finished project, step by step video and written tutorial (same as video). I found all to be very helpful. I feel much more confident about following other tutorials now.<br />Only gave 4 stars, because I would like to see it contain more lessons."
1,It was a proof version!
0,"I have just updated from Quicken 2007 for Mac to Quicken 2015 for Mac. I feel like I've been downgraded! So many of the useful features have been stripped out of the program. The most serious problem is the useless budgeting tool. I've read posts dating back years to 2015's predecessor, Essentials asking for a robust 12 month budgeting. Where is it? I am seriously considering returning the copy Quicken 2015 for mac I just purchased and moving to another finance software. So, if Intuit has any plans to issue an update soon, now is the time to speak up."
1,"This office suite works great . . . when it works.  It tends to freeze up and shut down quite often.  Any input that has not been saved is lost.  It's a shame because when it does work, it is quite useful, even better than Microsoft Office in some respects.  However, I would recommend looking for some other open source software as I am doing now."
1,"Had a more complicated return, including income from limited partnership. This program wouldn't handle it; I would need to enter the data on the required forms myself.  Ended up buying TurboTax Premier which handled these transactions."
1,They changed the product this year so you have to pay to e-file your state taxes. I assumed it was the same as last year where you got one free state e-file. I will not purchase this product again. I feel like I got the bait and switch.
0,This product has an extremely misleading title as TurboTax charges you extra for the State 2013 return.  This is a plain case of faulty advertising. The worst part is that in order to get a refund you have to go through Intuit as Amazon won't take responsibility for it.
4,"I have been using website X5 for a few years now after I started with X5 Evolution 9. I was impressed with it then and this latest version is the best so far.<br />This is aimed at those of us who wish to build our own great looking website without having to learn all the coding headaches needed for the very expensive software. I had tried several of web building software packages and I keep coming back to the X5. It is rock solid stable, dead easy to upload and edit and most of all it is possible to have a working website up and running within a couple of hours.<br />Installing the software was easy, click on Install, choose the language, click next and accept the agreement and install. If you are upgrading as I was, you have more work to do, but if this is a new install, it all becomes plain sailing.<br />Best of all, with X5 you can even create an online shop and sell your products or your collections. If you just want to put your club or personal photographs or perhaps just your own personal website, it really is very easy once you get the hang of it. The software is supplied with hundreds of templates which make the whole process of creating a professional looking website very easy and stress free."
0,"After spending hours trying to get this downloaded app to work even with Norton tech assistance, I gave up and I threw it in the trash and purchased a copy on a disk, which did work. Too annoyed to bother with a refund."
2,Just downloaded to one PC. Everything was fine. I'll rate this until after I finish downloading my other 2 PCs.
4,It was easy to download and use to file our taxes. The price was right and have it right away.
3,"I have used Quicken in the past and had stopped.  I am glad that I bought this, it is easy to use and it does what I need it to do."
4,The Turbo Tax was easy to download and I had our taxes done very soon after we received our W-2 Forms. Thanks.
3,I used it for years.  It's very good.  I'll keep using Norton until I find something better.  It's also light weight.
2,This product works as stated but when I downloaded it it did not do a great job editing existing PDF files.  There needs to be a program created to edit existing PDF's quickly and easily.
1,"I hate Intuit. Period. They nickel and dime you, support sucks, and the software is glitchy. But I had to buy this as we are married to Quickbooks. Two stars because they aren't the worst out there.<br /><br />PS: Never buy direct from Intuit... for some reason when they sell direct they charge more than a reseller. Go figure."
1,"I've used TurboTax for years and given their price hike and mess up this year decided to give HR Block at try.  Short answer: It's ok, but not as polished and has a few infuriating features that will send me back to TurboTax next year.<br /><br />* No &#34;bookmark&#34;.  You can mark an entry as &#34;tentative&#34; but TT lets you add a bookmark with notes to yourself about items where you need more info or need to come back.<br />* Estimated tax calculation is terrible.  For the Federal, it forces me to make changes to my W4 withholding rather than let me manage the amount through estimates.  For state it just dumps me into the State worksheet.  TT is much more refined.<br />* In a number of places HRB just dumped me into worksheets where they didn't have interviews or for some reason couldn't pull info from elsewhere in the return.<br />* HRB doesn't have a decent way to tell you which interview topics have been completed or not.<br />* If you donate stock, the interview doesn't have an appropriate choice for the valuation method.  Forcing me to do some research and hope it will get filled in correctly.<br />* Virtually no reporting.  A very week comparison to prior years which I use to sanity check and look for discrepancies or things I might have missed.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I am feeling much LESS confident that I've got it right."
1,I had to attempt it several times.  Ended up uninstalling and then reinstalling.  Outlook is NOT included??? And now every time I turn on my computer outlook comes up and offers for me to purchase it:(((( .  No bueno.
3,"I loaded this on 4 laptops (three windows - 2 a few years old Win 7, one new Win 8 and one chromebook almost new) and a ten year old Vista desktop.  I found a fair difference on my laptop (Windows 7), the Win 8 found a fair difference, the other 7 laptop user said he did not see a significant difference but it was a little faster.  The biggest difference was on the desktop - WOW!  It was so bogged down with so many things over 10 years that no one would use it, I am glad I have use of it again as I have a recipe book program on it and now I can access that again.  It's $50 for 5 computers for one year, which is a significant cost saving from Norton (close to $100 for 3 computers for one year) and I think it works better.  I have had Norton on that desktop since the day we got it, and obviously it has let viruses and other things on it over the years and whatever cleaner Norton says it has, obviously doesn't work as well as this.  Glad I took the chance!"
2,Needs a little more work.....
1,"What can you say about a product that has &#34;Upgrade to 2014&#34; as one of its toolbar items. Yes, other programs have UPGRADE in the Help menu, e.g. but not on the Toolbar where real estate is limited. I have always though this was a terrible company. I have come here to find out about upgrading from 2013 to 2014 and find that it's $175 ($200 if you do it from the Upgrade button). Unlike other companies the upgrade price is almost the selling price. And you can't sell your license as you can with other apps, if you decide to go in another direction."
4,"I buy these and install it on all three of my machines, works really well. I would buy it again."
3,"I've been a Quicken's user for twenty years and have made my personal accounting with the 2002 version. Now, with Windows 7 it didn't run anymore and had to buy a new one: chose 2010 Permier. Had to upgrade my old database and was helped by Quicken Support Staff. It has more than I need, but is lacking on some few important things: I can not merge two databases; I mean, if I have two files with old registers I can not turn those into one. I think, this is something basic I could do with a 30 usd software."
4,Does the job & catches the bad guys.
1,"Well...I presume this product to be Microsoft's revenge.  Word is a shell of the PC version, and the only reason this expensive little box gets 2 stars is Outlook.  It should be noted, however, that Outlook doesn't measure up to Windows compatible versions either.  If you can get by with native iOS tools, do it."
3,I found this to be a very good software program for protecting your computer.  It is easy to install and best yet - free.
1,"I have been using Quicken for many years, since an old DOS version and renewed as required for all these years:<br /> but I have never written nor complained before.<br />Since Quicken was about to withdraw support for older versions, I felt forced to buy this latest version.<br />I can no longer do any reconciliation to my checking account. I have been reconciling my on-line account with<br />Quicken for its wonderful reports and tax information, but this version only gives the newest on-line total and<br />will not allow me to actually reconcile the account. It went back to September's checks and opening balance, but uses the latest<br />on-line totals so the actual data is not accurate.<br /><br />This version is no longer useful-the bells and whistles outweigh the utility."
0,"Total waste, if you purchase the one year license, you still are not receiving the full product. This purchase is just to hook you into more and more up grades. Slows the pc, pop up ads to add more features."
3,Upgraded to Quicken 2015 for Windows to stay updated with my money management software. Added bonus of getting free cred score!
1,Have used Quicken for PC for many years.  Quicken for Mac does not allow for bill payment.  Very disappointed.  Wouldn't have purchased if I had known this.
2,"Good program with the exception of the cut and paste feature is not functional. Unable to cut and paste information into transactions. For example cut a conformation number of payment from bank site and paste into memo or notes column. I am disappointed that this does not work, the lack of cut and paste makes for a lot of unnecessary typing. Quicken needs to address this in a patch for their customers."
1,Works OK. Not happy they try to make you take a gift card as your refund. Also the PDF scan.
4,My daughter installed this for me.  She has never let me down...............and neither has AVAST!  I highly recommend it.  Never lets me down.
1,"So the software is somewhat helpful. What really annoys me though is the lack of product description on Amazon and the H&R Block price gauging extraveganza once you make your initial purchase. The program I got was the Premium with State. Unfortunately I am one of the millions of people that have to file for two states. This is where these programs really suck! You see the description says state returns (ploural); but neglects to tell you that this means you can file multiple PRINT returns for a single state. It state that a single state return (print) included, i.e. if you live in one state and work in another your going to need to fork over more money to H&R blockheads. It then basically forces you to purchase your second state for... get this.. MORE money than the fed and first state cost. How about that for some gauging!!! $30 dollars for fed and first state ---> $36 for second state. What really should get your attention is that this extra bend over w/o a please from H&R Block doesn't include free E-File for either state! Thats right folks, so if you want to file your state return electronically it will cost you $20 PER state to efile. So the original cost of $30, just went to $106, if I efile and have 2 states. Of course I want to e-file especially when it then tells you after you complete your NY state return, that NY may charge me $25 for a written return...WTF?<br /><br />(NY made it a crime to charge extra for e-file so this is not that bad, thank you NY. I now only need to file paper with its ugly polluted cousin NJ)<br /><br />To top it all off, I ended up owing the Fed money somehow (W4 set to 2). So conveinently HR & Block software offered me a fast and easy way to pay this fee. The only catch was they wanted to charge me a conveinence fee of $46 to process a credit card payment to the IRS. No thanks.<br /><br />(You can have the FED deduct straight from your bank account for free. Lets hope that congress doesn't get my account numbers.)"
2,Printshop Pro is a good software but is not for the beginner. It takes some previous experience with photo software to understand a lot of the functions and how to use them.
3,Been using Turbotax for over 10 years. Love it!  I do think the direct deposit charge is too high.
2,not as good as the old one
4,I am a Photoshop Elements convert. I was a dedicated ULead (now Corel) PhotoImpact user. Corel decided to eliminate the program by rendering it incompatible with Windows 7. After what must be nearly a decade of using PhotoImpact I was really really stressed with having to buy and learn a new program. The good news is Elements is a robust photo editing program with only a fraction of the complexity and learning curve of Photoshop. I was able to begin using it right away. I cannot recommend this program enough. I encourage you to visit [...] and download the demo version before you buy. It is fully functional for 30 days.<br /><br />Also......<br /><br />I have bought A LOT of software on line. This is why Amazon will be my first choice in purchasing software:<br /><br />1. Price: Amazon has the lowest price. This includes education discounts.<br />2. Convenience: I only have to wait to use the product for as long as it takes my PC to download.<br />3. Confidence: I know I can go back to Amazon in case I need to reinstall the program. ANYTIME. FREE. Many sellers of downloadable software charge a fee for the ability to download their programs for maybe up to 12 months.
4,I have used the Avast security product since buying a new laptop in 2009 and have not had a single problem.  that is a stark difference from other security software used in the past 10 years.
3,"I have been buying this package every few years for various remodel projects.  The program is getting better and improving, but the human interface model still is clunky and you have to learn it... not very intuitive.<br /><br />I can make the diagrams as I need for planning, and contractor communcations, so it will do what you want...<br /><br />I will never spend the time needed to make the product the way they advertise it with perfect 3D walkthrough.  why?<br /><br />If you find a 6 panel door, it takes you about 10 clicks to make the 6 panel door the color you want, unless you want it grey.  Once you make one, you can copy and paste, but that process does not work very effectively so you end up just adding new doors... and they are all grey.... so be it..<br /><br />oh how I wish I could get it to look like they do on the DIY type programs... but I am not going to invest the time to make it work.  It is a shame, since it would not take that much to make these apps more mainstream when it comes to the user experience."
2,ok
3,"The product is getting massive buzz in the gaming news groups.  You will need to install a codec pack from DivX or Xvid.  It will start and stop recording using hot key combinations.  There are some kinks yet to be worked out:<br /><br />1.) EpicRewind must be run as Administrator, and the game being hooked must be run as Administrator.<br /><br />2.) After hooking a game with EpicRewind the configured settings will be \\""locked in\\"". The configured settings can only be changed by restarting EpicRewind and re­hooking the game.<br /><br />3.) Capture screenshot has several issues to address. Currently it displays demo mode and FPS overlays in windowed mode games.  In fullscreen mode capture screenshot will Produce a black frame or the Windows desktop depending on the graphics library.<br /><br />4.) League of Legends and some other games create excessive memory fragmentation in their process space which can be prevent larger buffers from being allocated. EpicRewind will always attempt to allocate as much buffer as possible up to the specified rolling buffer size."
1,"10/25/2013 PROBLEM SOLVED UPDATE Not sure how increase score... but<br /><br />Found the problem!!!!<br />Verification verified no issues.<br /><br />I am still not sure how I found this.. but.. somehow when updated to 2014 using data  QDF file I started over in 2011, it was picking up check registry entries from an very old account transactions from 2004-2008!  It did not show up on the screen where I closed all the other old accounts.  And it never showed up using Quicken 2011.<br /><br />I was able to \\""close\\"" it form a different screen when I searched around more in accounts and I am no longer bankrupt with a negative 400K net worth.<br /><br />Another problem I hadn't mentioned but somewhat related is after the 2014 update it brought in about 90 days of transactions in another bank account from a separate QDF file for a separate corporation I use Quicken for.  I was able to delete that account and get rid of its wrong negative balance in personal account. Deleting it didn't disturb it in corporation account where it belongs and shows all data correctly.<br /><br />My only conclusion is the update to 2014 was a bit too aggressive converting files and picked up some accounts it shouldn't have.<br /><br />But all is cured and at least related to banking which is about all I use Quicken for.<br /><br />Also there were some folks trying to be helpful and exploring the issue on the intuit community board which try to be very helpful.<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST AND ISSUE:<br />I don't use most of the features except checking account control, pay almost everything via bill pay and use it for self employed tax integration with Turbo Tax. Updated from 2011 since am about to go to Win8.1  Have used Quicken for over a decade.<br /><br />One issue that is discussed but seems unresolved starting with 2013  and continues in 2014 version, is that you can not \\""hide\\"" totally old accounts supposed balances in the accounts bar from years ago. Depending on how you set them up, you either have \\""more accounts or \\""Separate\\"" .<br /><br />In my accounts bar  I have in red a negative  $460,620.41 somehow from accounts both hidden and CLOSED.  My active two bank accounts have the correct balance but I find no way to get rid of the negative $460k (have no idea how its computed).<br /><br />The Closed feature is in theory good addition in 2014, but it does not get rid of the account balance on accounts bar/list<br /><br />From many discussions on the Quicken community board with comments like \\""Good Grief\\"" and why doesn't \\""hide\\"" mean hide not show just balance.  It appears if you hide all the accounts my huge negative balance (no I never was overdrawn 400K) show up in \\""more accounts\\"".  All these about 60 \\""more accounts\\"" are closed using closed option and have a zero balance yet shows up as -460K on accounts list.<br /><br />Just to be clear in account list every account except the 2 current checking accounts are hidden and closed.<br /><br />At one point was able to get all switched to the \\""Separate\\"" listing same -460k in section not in regular \\""banking\\""  However it seems if you show any bank separate (like the 2 I want), it will show the prior years negative amount on the about 60 accounts that are now closed with zero balances.<br /><br />Makes no sense.  There seems to be no way to get rid of the alleged by Quicken my negative 400k balance (or net worth).  Bankruptcy will not even cure in Quicken!  (No I don't have those kinds of debts have no idea why shows -400k)<br /><br />The only cure may be to try and start over with new file, new account in 2014 without maybe 10 years of data coming over in these closed accounts.  I did year-end thing at end of prior calendar years."
1,"I've upgraded from 2012.   This version has more institutions with automatic transaction downloads and an interface to Morningstar. Unfortunately the automated transaction download is hobbled by multiple bugs that have required manual workarounds.  If you have a variety of account types from different financial institutions, expect that working around these bugs will cost you significant time if you update to Quicken 2015.    I've used Quicken for over 15 years. It  has many extremely useful features--automated transaction downloads from most major institutions, ease of getting reports and account balances, and a reconciliation tool.    The overall features--if they worked more flawlessly and had more ways of working around bugs and changes---would get it five stars. It is dropped to two due to some severe bugs without convenient workarounds--namely the ability to easily do mass imports and corrections and easily merge accounts into a single account.    In the most major bug, I set up my Everbank accounts for automated transaction download (previously only one of them was on the manual web-connect download). The system renamed one of my Everbank accounts and deleted another.  Unfortunately I found out about the deletion after making a bunch of manual entries to update another account. Make sure you backup your file before changing your online downloads!    A second pattern is that Quicken's online download will miss transactions for no reason. There is a workaround for this--you can reset the \\""starting date\\"" for the account if this persists; however if you don't notice this problem in time you may have to manually track down and update the transactions. Also having to hunt down and execute a workaround is a unacceptable. This has happened involving both a brokerage account and a bank with savings and checking accounts.     With yet a fourth institution, it stopped downloading my credit card transactions and instead had an error message. Trying to \\""reset\\"" the onlinesetup using Quicken's instructions provided by the error handling popups caused Quicken to freeze until I killed it with task manager. I tried the \\""reset\\"" multiple times; each time Quicken froze and had to be killed. Finally, I was able to restore the automated download by  deactivating and reactivating the online download for the account. This will cause both already cleared and reconciled as well as new positions to be downloaded; get ready for more manual cleanup work.    Another annoyance is that Quicken provides no way of recovering individual account information from a backup or other source and importing into bank or brokerage accounts. You can export account transactions and import them into an asset account and try a \\""mass copy\\"" into a bank account.    The Morningstar interface is useful; however it would be more useful if it showed you dollar values."
4,It did everything it was supposed to do. It is a great time saver. No need for an adding machine.
3,You can follow their lead or do it yourself. Love Turbotax. A few of the questions could use editing but that is my only criticism.
3,I have had few issues with this product. The one issue I did have was addressed by customer service. Easy to use and plenty of options for creating quality resumes.
4,"Clean, simple menus!  Great!"
1,"I wish I had of held out for a \\""hard\\"" copy of this program. It was too much for my XP computer, and I had to remove it because it froze up my computer."
3,I have been a  turbo tax user for years.  Today I found that although I got turbo federal and state when I downloaded Deluxe.I found I have to pay an additional 24.99 to e-file; I am furious and will end my intuit days. forever.  all you wannt to do is be greedy like all of your ilk. I don't need you people.<br />Dorothy B Lamberth
1,"Been using Quicken for over 10 years - my complaint is that for a decade the software has been buggy with annoying quirks that they seem unwilling to fix.  For instance, if you protect your finances with a password (you should), you cannot utilize the automatic functionality of the scheduled-updates feature.  Also, some shortcuts, such as CTRL-D and CTRL-I are buggy and don't always work.  Nothing so heinous that I'm going to switch to a different financial suite; I'm sticking with Quicken since I know it and am not ready to re-learn something else.  I would rate it a 4 if they would actually improve each version and fix glitches, rather than simply dress it up and introduce new bugs inadvertently."
2,"The free version has been very, very good.  I tried the 30 day 'free' trial upgrade to their premium version and iTunes went wacky. Uninstalled the 'upgraded' version and iTunes went back to normal.  The annoying pop-ups do not annoy me because I consider it a very modest price to pay for<br />the free service Avast provides."
0,"Paid $25, then 8 weeks later it stopped working. I cannot open the program nor run the program and no one at tech support will email me back.<br /><br />Hello, Malwarebytes, does anyone work there or is your company like that credit report commercial where mainframe computers pretend to be people?"
4,"easy to use and offers plenty of explanations and help, really makes filing taxes a straight-forward task.  I would recommend to others"
4,"I have been using avast! for 2 years, and I have had no virus problems. Very easy to use, most things run automatically and unobtrusively. The tools and scans are great."
1,"What can I say... It's a good tool for the average person to do his/her taxes if you only have to report interest/dividends and charitable contributions.  It provides an accurate and secure alternative to handing it over to the unregulated & legalized loan shark agencies which have popped up over the last decade.  HOWEVER, this year's version has REMOVED Schedules D & E, which were part of the \\""Deluxe\\"" package for the last 10+ years I've used it.  I may have to go another route when it's time to sell my home or take distributions from my IRA/401k, and after-tax mutual funds."
1,"Unfortunately, I upgraded this year from my previous Quicken.  The program is bugsy and from what customer service tells me, they are working through it based on customer complaints.  I upgraded for the mobile capability which doesn't always work.  The mobile budget continually crashes and neither I nor customer service can get it to work--though after I sent the trouble screen shots they tell me they will get it to work--that was over four weeks ago.  Their answer was that \\""we are working on it.\\""  I would wait before upgrading or buying this product!"
3,works
1,"While video quality increases and yes this program does add in features to edit 4k ultra high definition video, everything else gets down scaled. This program, other than the 4k markup, is not as good as Movie Studio 11 which is kind of hard to believe so the only added benefit would be 4k markup unless you really want to do video editing via touch screen which I don't recommend. There are less transitions ect, just less stuff in this than 11. Its the same royalty free music and sound effects they provided with Studio 11. So if you need to mark up to 4k and want less stuff than this is the program for you. Also if you never used any of Sony video editing software there is learning curve involved like all editing software. This software is unstable and I recommend back ups every second. I just don't have a lot of good to say about this in a review as its just not as good as studio 11 is and was, the only thing that is usefull about 13 would be 4k markup that's it! I also didn't really like the 4k up-scaling in this program and feel Corel X7 does a better job handling and quality wise with UHD files. So that my 2 cents! Enjoy!"
3,Use it every year. Worked great just as expected.
3,"Only issue I've found is that the State information has not been accurate for the past 2 years.  I use Turbo Tax to enter everything and figure out refund or amount owed, but then go onto my State's website and re-enter because the filing is free.  Last year TT said I owed a penalty but State website didn't (whew) and this year TT said I'm required to pay estimated taxes but not per my State (again - good).  Other than that - all good."
3,So far this security software has met my expectation only time will be the real test. Very easy to install on my computers.
1,"This software doesn't take ITIN. I wanted to add my mother as a dependent. She has an ITIN number (not SSN). I entered the ITIN number in the form. It keeps telling me that there is an error in the form - &#34;This field should contain an SSN, ITIN, ATIN, or the word DIED. Please Check&#34;. I did enter a valid ITIN. I talked to their customer support, but they keep saying  my ITIN is invalid and I need to talk to social security administration.<br />It might be a software bug, but then their next tier support has to review the case and get back with a resolution in about 3 business days. He added, it can take 5-7 business days sometimes.<br /><br />So now my only option is to file a paper return!"
3,"Ive not got great experience with photo editing, so was looking for something quite intuitive, yet powerful. This fits the bill. I particularly like the 'Basic', 'Expert' levels you can easily toggle to give you more or less options and control. I'd recommend this product."
3,"Most words are the same, but I was still surprised.  Great program, though.  My son has a lot of fun with it (9-year-old)."
2,"I would really rather not hand enter all my trades from my brokerage account.  H&R doesnt have the breadth of imports that the other software has.  I am actually tempted to get the other software, import the trades, and then import that tax return into this one.."
0,"After using Quicken for decades I was shocked to find that the Drop Down Reports that were created in previous versions will not work with Quicken 2013. I read on a few blogs that Quicken isn't in a hurry to correct this error (it is almost March 2013). I had to revert back to Quicken 2011 and I will check the update page periodically to see if they corrected this problem. Hint: If it isn't broken, don't fix it!<br />March Update: Quicken just introduced their latest Release 11 update for Quicken 2013. Unfortunately, this update (R-10 to R-11)did NOT correct the above problem. The only \\""Drop Down\\"" so far is in Quicken quality control."
3,"I've been using it for a few years. I acquired a Bing search engine redirect virus. Otherwise, it's pretty good."
4,I've used WordPerfect for 20 years and have always found it to be a superior product.  This version is no exception.
2,"I've used MS Office for years on PC's. I don't need Powerpoint or Outlook and I was unhappy to pay a higher price for a single computer license. In previous years, Word and Excel previously came in a three license version for home users.<br /><br />I was disappointed in how different the UI was compared to Office 2010. I'm still looking for the features I've come very used to. They are in there, I just have to look for them. Changing the page size, working with styles, and the other options are just slightly different. One difference I especially dislike. That is the track changes feature. I'm used to the changes showing up inside the doc with deleted words crossed out and inserted words in the editors color. In this version all changes in the document are no longer visible but noted in balloon notes to the right side. I find this much more difficult to use, especially on Mac screens where the fonts are especially small. OpenOffice on the other hand has balloon text that you can actually read. Another difference that I'm still trying to get used to is the find/replace/heading list pane on the left of the document. The find/replace option is gone and put into the upper right of the screen. I've also discovered a few quirks in the headings listing where they don't show unless I move the slider up and down. I can't figure that one out.<br /><br />So, I'm a bit peeved at the changes that need not have been made in the user interface, but since I must use MS Word for my writing, I'll just have to figure it out.<br /><br />One other major gripe I have about this version is the inclusion of a trial of Outlook. Outlook has been the favorite attack mechanism for virus writers for years. Since I no longer work in an office, Outlook has no value to me. I use web based email readers. The problem is that since I'm using a smaller solid state disk drive, I find no reason to keep extra software on my machine that I'll never use or pay for. Outlook can not be deleted by the averageuser. You have to get into a UNIX shell, navigate to the Outlook directory and delete it that way. I won't recommend that to anyone, since you need sudo root access and I would never encourage a novice user to get in with that level of access who could potentially screw up other system necessities.<br /><br />I wonder if MS is trying to discourage Mac users from using their products. But if you need advanced formatting features, track changes, and industry output options, this is pretty much the only game in town. If you don't need all that, go with Pages. It's a lot cheaper and has most necessities that the average user needs."
2,They charge additional $19 for state efile - don't see why the charge should be so high just to efile.
2,"Before you read the rest, I am a supporter of this product and it's a great product.  My poor review is my disappointment with the only feature I upgraded to have: the \\""NEW! Snap and store receipts...\\"" function. It is very a misleading photo on the package to upgrade to 2014.  It's easier to manually open a scanner, put in a receipt, *pdf it, pull it out and do it again for the thousands I have.  There is NO automatic \\""*pdf image receipt\\"" sync FROM the desktop TO the mobile device -- it's the other way around.  You have to take a picture with the mobile device or have an image on the mobile device to sync it to the desktop.  It's important to obtain the clarity and OCR needed to acquire the best image to make this work.  Taking a picture with your mobile device does NOT take a *.pdf image -- so when the Cloud sync is performed, the image is transferred over from the mobile device to the desktop as distorted because a receipt isn't flat while being captured with a background -- there's no automatic crop feature to separate your receipt from wherever you lay it down to capture it with your mobile device.  When it is available to view on the desktop it is poor quality as compared to a *.pdf image and NOT helpful as a receipt image vs a crooked/crinkled up/unflat photo image.  In addition, it is more difficult to attach an image in 2014 from the desktop than it was in 2013, slowing down the process of all the images captured on my desktop.  It can't be viewed as a little *.pdf image anymore either, it shows an icon -- NOT a better upgrade feature.  I really wish I wouldn't have upgraded now and wouldn't have if I actually saw a detailed video of the processes involved in this new \\""receipt\\"" option.  As a records management professional, I had a fully functional idea of what this should have done/been and feel the kinks still need to be worked out in the next future upgrade.  They should have hired a records professional to consult for this \\""receipt upgrade\\"" for everyone to get their money's worth out of this new feature.  The receipt option, in my opinion, will only work by taking double the work/time it took before using 2013.  I expect a high quality image that should be easily accessible with this software by using my desktop as a primary source and the mobile device as a fully functional synchronization, even if that means I would have to pay a little more to have all the images on a cloud service.  The package reads \\""no more need for overstuffed wallets and messy receipt piles\\"" but the amount of work to accomplish this is pretty much the same to me.to get their money's worth out of this new feature.

4,I am certaily well pleased with this program. Wow! No more messed up balances...a one-two-three look at my accounts in all that is needed. It's difficult to make a mistake with the help of the Quicken program. I highly recommend it to everyone who might want to keep accurate records in a vey simple way.
4,work good
4,Great for editing my photos makes editing easy and fun with the guided portion that helps you get the look you want.. They look beautiful and professional.
2,"Like many others, I bit the bullet and moved from a Windows PC using Quicken to a Mac, and initially went with iBank 4.  Had been using Quicken for about 10 years and iBank4 for 18 months. Recently, I upgraded to iBank 5 and there are definite improvements in downloading investment transactions -- now gets commission right, as well as option transactions; didn't in previous version -- worth the upgrade fee just for that.<br /><br />I find the iBank interface to be non-intuitive -- particularly the reports.  In fact, I find the reports to be so useless, that I avoid using them.  For instance, the Investment Portfolio Report ignores cash balances, so if you trade at all and your cash levels vary, you can't see your performance in a helpful way over time.  I just generated a Net Worth chart that features a lovely bar chart, but unfortunately all the bars are relatively the same size because my net worth is high (scale issue), and when I mouse over it, no numbers show up, so I can't tell whether I'm up or down.  And BTW, the Net Worth figures are wrong, because this software is not picking up a CD in one of my stock investment accounts.  The other investment accounts show correct values.<br /><br />iBank 5 is just okay, and I'll stick with it because the register portion works well along with the downloads from my financial institutions -- automatic each time I restart it.  In addition, my financial institutions now provide end of year Capital Gains reports to import into my Tax Returns -- matches what they send to the IRS, so the fact that the iBank 5 Reports don't work for me is no big deal -- just a minor annoyance at this point.<br /><br />But I long for the Quicken days when I could generate a custom report in under a minute for a particular need, and I can't do that with the iBank product.<br /><br />In short, I'd recommend getting the trial directly from the iBank people, to try and see if it works for you, because some of the features work well -- and they might be just the features that you need.  Besides iBank is the only MAC game in town, unless you want to run a Windows partition -- Parallel's / Quicken.<br /><br />Update:  For about the last 6 months, I've been using the new Quicken 2015 for MAC that's available at the Apple App Store and Amazon.  The current version is a reasonable and a good start, and while not as functional (yet) as the PC version, each update (every month or two) gets better.  The look and feel is very good, and the latest version will import and convert iBank files according to release notes.  Reviews on this product are mixed  --  while I find it useful, others don't.  So you may wish to check it out (reviews, features) before you buy.sides iBank is the only MAC game in town, unless you want to run a Windows partition -- Parallel's / Quicken.

1,It didn't work
1,I was finally able to get my taxes done with help from accountant friends.  H&R Block was absolutely no help.  They even told me to come into their office for assistance and when I got there I was told they could not help me and the one piece of information they did provide was incorrect.  Next year will use Tax Turbo or Tax cut.
0,"After you buy the state and state efile, this ends up being just about the same price as some of the more expensive turbotax packages, but I believe it's still cheaper than doing it online.  I'll be looking at an alternative for my daughter's simple taxes next year."
4,"I was a little worried about downloading it rather than buying the disc, but I needed ASAP for work as I bought a Mac and my work has PCs. It downloaded and installed in less than 5 minutes. The only tricky part was finding the &#34;key&#34; code to activate it. I hunted and found the key code is listed in your Amazon account section (&#34;Your Orders&#34;) next to the summary of the product. As for the functioning of the software, I haven't use it yet, but it's Microsoft, so expects quite a few quirks and frustration when formatting, lol."
0,How do I get a refund! Is does not like my 401K distribution and wants me to upgrade to the $70 version just to type in 4 forms 1099-F forms
2,"I'm pretty mad at me first, and then Turbo Tax. I normally buy H&R Block but forgot that and bought Turbo Tax at Costco for an okay price. It never occurred to me that it wouldn't include all schedules, particularly Schedule C. When I got to that point my taxes were almost done so I bit the bullet and bought the version with Schedule C, basically buying the program I didn't want in the first place twice. Then, I got a notice from Costco that I would be automatically upgraded to the version I already bought. So, my bad for not paying attention to what I was buying. The program is fine. Just make sure it has the features you need."
2,It has taken some getting used to compared to the 2008 version that we had.
2,Very buggy. MP4 issues all the time. The input MP4 has to match the output file and the renderer can't see any errors or it locks up. I have struggled for hours trying to find the issue. It will also lock up saving as any HD video output. I would request a refund if it wasn't a download.
3,I am still learning how to use the new layout and features of QB Payroll 2015 but so far I like it.
4,great for my new laptop.
0,This version will not list Individual entries by categories & payees.  Only lists lump amounts per category or per payee.  Old version much better but it will not work on my new laptop which has windows 8.
0,"I have been a Quicken user for over a decade.  I updated from Quicken Home and Business 2012 to 2015 and asked for my money back in one day.  While converting my data file from 2012 to 2015 I got a message that something is wrong with my file and I should contact customer support even if everything seem normal.  I got on chat support support and was told &#34;as long as everything seems ok, it is just a false alarm and not to worry&#34;.  I proceeded to use my new software to reconcile credit card, had problems reconciling, printed a register report and saw about a third of all transactions was in millions of dollars.  (I am not rich).  The rest of the entries were identical at $64.00.  Pretty frightening.  Dont' touch this software or it will blow up in your face one day."
1,"I was traveling in an RV, my laptop had crashed and I had to buy a new one.  I didn't have my discs to reinstall Street Atlas 2013, so purchased a download of Street Atlas 2015.  It worked OK for my primary purpose of highway navigation, but the search function and the phone directory fail to activate.  I will probably get these functions operational eventually, but resent the extra time and hassle involved."
3,"I upgraded to Quicken 2015 from Quicken Essentials, and I am very happy that I did. The interface is much more intuitive and fluid, and the reports tell me more things that I actually would like to know. Still missing a couple functionalities that would be nice to have (like more long-term budgeting), but the integration with the iphone app is nice to have as well."
4,Good Stuff
1,"I have had a couple of different versions of Quicken over my life. My last was version 2012 and I hated it. Every time I would sync my checking account, I had to reconcile since it typically missed pulling in things. When it missed a few, it became cumbersome to even want to use it, so I uninstalled.<br /><br />Now version 2013.  I was happy that setting up accounts was even easier with this version. I got everything synced and thought it looked good. I synced again after a few days and wouldn't you know it, my checking account (different bank this time) was wrong. It was missing entries. I deleted, set it up again, which does take a while  assigning categories. I did a sync a few days later and this time it was fine.  Great I thought.  I just synced again today and sure enough, it is missing several entries.  One from over a week ago.  If I delete the account and set it up again, those same entries do come over, so it is not like it is a pending transaction.<br /><br />So, I hate this software. Two different versions, different banks, and it still skips downloading entries.  What good is financial software if it does this?  I want to use it for its most basic functionality and that fails for me miserably.<br /><br />If Quicken support comments, yes, I have the latest updates. i also had them with 2012 and it did not matter then either."
4,I love turbotax! I use it every year.
0,Never use again. Removed simply worksheet I needed. Wanted $30 more!!
4,I have used Quicken since 2003 and am always happy with my choice.<br />It gives helps and guides as you work with it and reminds me to back it<br />up each time a close the program.  It so easy to prepare deductibles when<br />it is tax time.  Our tax man says I always have everything he needs; titles<br />and lists of each deductables.
0,"So far I am not too impressed. It stated I had to update my iTunes to 7.1 or higher so I downloaded iTunes version 12.1.1.4, did a restart and it still won't recognize it. Also, it is frustrating when a program does not give a HELP link option to solve these type of problems. I am not ready to discard<br />it but I am hopeful that someone from BLAZE will respond to this problem SOON!!!"
0,"dumb turbo tax, they do not even scale the price down as 15th April approaches. Looks to me that some one in intuit purposely wants to bring the sales down due to some politics.<br /><br />bye bye TT here I come HR block"
3,My PC was not playing videos for 3days - Mcafee kept saying my PC was secure and no issues found. When I installed Norton - it detected a whopping 147 issues and fixed them all. Giving a 4 only becoz I've been using it only for 8 hours now
2,"TurboTax Deluxe for 2013 appears to discise some back end pricing and restrictions for the &#34;Refund Bonus Offer&#34;, until after you finish your taxes.  Federal is able to file free, and if you are due a refund, you can Either apply it all to the Amazon bonus offer, or Direct Deposit and purchase bonds, but not both.  One of the restrictions is you can not split your return to get the gift card at a 10% premium.<br /><br />Additionally the costs for posting your state taxes is not clear until you are ready to file.  The rates appear to have gone up this year to file state electronically.  Perhaps it's by state, but PA is now $44.99.<br /><br />Be cautious if you are a last minute filer.  And next year, Try to file earlier and consider your options.  I'm going to try Tax Act instead, for the first time in many years of using TurboTax."
1,"Intuit rushed two-factor authentication out without verifying the second factor. If you found yourself without access to your email, lost access to that account, or had an invalid email address your tax return was encrypted and you can no longer access it. Furthermore, you were blocked from accessing Turbotax at all. Only by uninstalling the software and removing the OSX preference files for Intuit could you regain access to TurboTax through a re-install.<br /><br />That's pretty tough if you were just waiting to file."
1,I had used H&R Block software as well as TurboTax previously.  I was disappointed with the inability to resolve a major bug unless you contact their online support.  The solution offered in the troubleshooting simply did not work.  Yet it was the first thing that the online person suggested so it was a known problem.
1,"Software does not work, tried to load on two different machines just to double check.  I bought the cd version instead and that worked.  I do not recommend."
0,I bought this hoping to use the photo view option to do a landscape plan and some interior redecorating.  I used chief architect to draw our entire house plan so I know I am not a complete novice.  This software may work well but the users guide is pretty useless and it is not what I would call user friendly.  Wish I had kept my money
4,"Turbo Tax is a life saver...it makes the boring and sometimes scary task of filing taxes enjoyable. With step by step instructions, there is little to chance of error. I am a fan and will continue to use this product annually for personal and business use."
1,"I use OneDrive, Google Drive and Malwarebytes Secure Backup. All three are easy to use. Amazon Cloud Drive is not and I no longer use it."
3,I have used this product for over 10 years and found it to be very easy to use and very accurate.
3,"Easy to use, but did not get the state tax filed for free like the ads said.  I was charged $19.99 to file the state tax through Turbo tax.  I emailed Turbo tax about why this happened and got no response."
0,"Turbo tax will not load after about three months, so it is useless if you ever need to check your back taxes.<br />I bought 2011, 2012 and it happened on both discs would not load.<br />be sure to print every thing you need or you will be sorry!"
3,I have been using H&R Block Tax software for years (it was originally named TaxCut.) I find that it meets my needs at a very reasonable cost.
0,"I am not a novice, I have been using Quicken for 20 years and Have been a softwate4 developer and software manager for 30 years. It is full of bugs,  Don't buy it.  I installed it and spent lots of time on the phone with them trying to resolve the problems in the \\""Budgeting\\"" module.  They admitted the problems and said I could get my money back.  I'm going to try.  Check online for the 2013 problems, even the CPA's are complaining.<br /><br />They did give me my money back, It only took a couple of weeks.  They deserve praise for this."
3,I have been using it for years it is one of the best antivirus.i have never had a virus. the best
4,excellent download and app!
2,"I had 2003 Quicken...loved it...no problems.  But this new version 2013 has been difficult.  Until I called for help, everything was backwards.  Deposits would subtract and credits would add...very frustrating."
0,"The download did not work.  It took me a lot of time working with Norton to get it finally downloaded.  I did not realize from the Amazon description that it was the &#34;old&#34; version and still do not understand what this means.  Also, in my opinion, Norton has very unethical business practices.  They tried to automatically charge $90 for this product even though I had, I thought, disabled the auto re-new option.  It required more time and effort to get this charge rimbursed on my credit card.  They then disabled the new downloaded version from Amazon, which required even more time to correct.  It is my feeling that Norton makes installing this product from sources other than them very difficult so that they can sell the product at three times the price.  All this being said, I like the product."
3,Avast has proven to be one of the best antivirus program I have ever used. It has stopped every virus that has tried to get through.Always updating and easy download
1,"Not as user friendly as all the earlier years, would not import information from previous years and only saved in .pdf format so I doubt that it will import this info next year if I was given over to buying it again.  Too bad I've used TT for the last 10 years and this &#34;deluxe&#34;. edition was so much less than advertised and deserved.  I would rather learn to use another product that go with another edition of TT.  I deserve a refund alright...of my purchase price of TT."
0,Junk
0,I had read a bad review and did not paid attention. I should have...
0,I have done a lot of business with Amazon and have bought office downloads before and installed it without any problem. I have spent hours trying to download and verify this product and it still will not download. I am at the verge of giving this product to Amazon and going someplace else and purchase a copy that I can download and be at peace. I have spent all day on the phone and computer with different technicians trying to get some help. I have had it with this product. I will not even rate this product.
2,"I don't use the new features so it is still the same as the 2012 version to me.<br />I really like using Quicken. You are forced to upgrade every two years to continue using the bank download feature, which I like.<br />Sometimes I have trouble with downloading info from my banks but it could be user error I suppose :/)"
4,Love my Mac and this made work life a lot easier
4,"The best available, nothing more needs to be said."
0,"Looks like there's a reason it's version 1.0  I downloaded and installed this program. It would not run when I tried to open it. Contacted Amazon tech support and they exhausted all their ideas. Refunded my purchase price, but when I went to uninstall it from my system from the actual Control Panel, I right-clicked uninstall and NOTHING HAPPENED. Hopefully nothing shady went onto my computer. If it did, I'll be making some angry phone calls. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PROGRAM!!! Zero stars."
3,"I have been using this for years.  Helps keep all my data, depreciation items, info organized and ready for the next year.  Streamlines my tax prep.  Never had any issues with tax returns.  Good value."
0,"If you're like me, you're purchasing Quicken because you used it in the past, and have so many transactions that you're pretty much stuck with it.  I don't even know why you're reading this, you've got no choice but to buy it.  I gave it one star, but I still bought it.  When you do, here's what you're in for.<br /><br />Quicken 2014 continues the tradition of providing no added value, adding bugs, all while charging you for the privilege thanks to their \\""3-year sunset\\"" poison pill they added in (they copied MS Money's 3 year upgrade cycle)<br /><br />* Pros:  None.  Zero.  Zippo.<br /> - The only reason it's nestled on it's #1 budget software is it's been nailed to the perch.<br /> - It is an ex-good accounting program.  It's passed on.  This good program is no more.  It's ceased to be.  It's gone on to meet it's maker.  Bereft of life, it innovates no more.<br /> - They didn't screw up too many things, or remove too many useful features.  Trust me, for Intuit, this is a plus.<br /><br />* Cons noticed in the first day of use:<br />  - Pastel color scheme for those who don't like color.<br />  - It's the first half of January, they're already up to the 5th patch on a product that hasn't essentially changed in 5 years.<br />  - Visibly slower than version 2011.  Horribly slower.  I can watch v2014 redraw on the screen with my new computer, while v2011 was pretty much instant even on my 5-year-old old Windows XP laptop.<br />  - In v2012, Quicken introduced a bug they promised to fix (in their forums, during beta test) for the investment screen -- longer column headers like \\""Return (%) 3-year\\"" or \\""Average Cost Per Share\\"" used to auto-wrap, like in excel, and could take one to four lines.  They screwed up that feature and now you will see a row of column headings that say \\""Averag...\\"" and \\""Retur....  Retur.....  Return....\\"" where it used to wrap and say Return 1-year, Return 3-year, Return 5-year.  They later came back and said (paraphrasing) \\""it's operating as expected.\\""<br /><br />If Intuit put half as much effort (or any effort) into improving this program as they did eliminating or buying up the competition (Mint.com) then screwing them up....it would be a decent program.  As it is, it's the only game in town if you have any investments or prior quicken history to track.<br /><br />I give it 1-star to recognize that while it gets worse every time, they give you a pop-up saying \\""You need to pay us for more bugs and errors, or will freeze your accounts.\\"" So thanks for the pop-up.  I wait for the first alternative that doesn't get bought out and lets me import my data.<br /><br />TLDR:  So suck it up, pay the fee, and rent the software for 3 more years because you have no choice.  I really do wish I had better news."
3,"Having been a TurboTax user for nearly twenty years, and having read several positive user reviews for the H&R Block tax product, I opted to give it a try.  I found the H&R Block Tax Software Deluxe + State to be similar to TurboTax, enough so that it was easy to navigate, with only a few exceptions.  The font size of the instructions, questions, forms, etc., was a little small for me, and I do wish there had been an option to increase the text size to make them more easily readable.  When instructed to &#34;go to&#34; a link or tool (which was in the tool bar location), I had to deduce that, and due to the smaller font/text/icon size, it took me a little time to see the icon in order to proceed.  Having done that, the program easily proceeded as directed/expected.  The final negative for me was that at almost the end of the exercise of completing my tax return, I was asked if I wanted to apply any refunds due me to some cards.  I have no problem with that, and you can choose to do so or not, but the link to choose not to have a refund go towards &#34;gift&#34; cards, was so light green that I barely could see it in order to choose that option and to proceed to e-file my return.  In summary, I will say that I would appreciate the option of increasing font/icon sizes, and also the (H&R Block) green color for links in the program was very light, and whether intentional or not, that made it difficult and time consuming to actually see the link in order to opt out from purchasing more H&R Block product.  That said, I did like the program overall, and it was easy to navigate (with the minor exceptions I have mentioned). I was happy with the purchase, the product did what I needed it to, and more, and I even got both on-line and over the phone help from H&R Block representatives when I needed it, due to some complexities regarding my tax situation.  I would recommend this product to anyone considering purchasing a good tax product like this, in the future."
1,Can't say would not download return to inteuit.... Sent the e-mail for return but have not gotten any response....
3,Works great for small business.  Has everything I need for tracking my finances.
0,"This is the second year that I have had problems with H & R Block at Home Delux I can not get the program to update and therefore, can not print or e-file.  I contacted customer support over 5 times and have been disconnected 4 times.  This morning I talked to a customer service rep and was told the program has a glich and try to update in a few days.... Really... I will go back to Turbo Tax next year so I can file without any problems..."
3,"Very long time user as well.  Had not purchased this year as of yet.<br />Have used Home and Business, Premier, and Deluxe in the past due to rental property, self-employment and cap. gains.<br />Was able to use Deluxe in recent times and was alarmed by what many of you were experiencing.<br />I did reach out to Bob Meighan, VP TurboTax, and he is offering a satisfactory solution for at least this tax year.<br />I'll take it rather than take a shot with H & R.  Don't want to cut off my nose to spite my face.<br />I just hope that your reviews force TurboTax to rectify this problem for 2015 and beyond.<br />If not, H & R Block, EA's, and CPA's will be smiling to the bank...<br />By the way, I don't work for TurboTax nor have any interest other than to get my taxes done accurately this year at a reasonable cost.  Don't kill the messenger!!!"
2,The Mac software acts like a beta version.  We will be glad to see updates that corrects some of the bugs.
2,"I have always used Norton, but, recently, I had heard that Norton is not that great.  I researched products and found that BitDefender had a higher rating than Norton, even though some reviewers said it is not as user-friendly.  Well, I wish I would have stuck w/ Norton, since I never had any problems w/ it.  Not that my computer is the fastest thing in the world, but BitDefender made it run more slowly.  Also, I could never complete a deep system scan.  It is supposed to take about 8 hrs, but, it would run for maybe 4 hrs, then say it couldn't complete the task.  So, where the red ball is, there is always an exclamation point, saying I need to address an item, which is the deep scan.  Seeing as how I cannot return the BitDefender, I would have to try to find a cheap Norton product to replace it, since I already feel I wasted too much money.  I wish I had stuck to Norton.  Also, w/ BitDefender, is occasionally turns off to update and the ball turns grey, which is worrisome.  I never got any viruses w/ it, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, as it uses up too much memory."
4,Not much I can say that others have not already said I'm sure but I use this program several times a week and it has been a BIG help on several occasions.
2,I purchased this product to transfer my VHS tapes to DVD. The first week I used this product I found it very easy to use and was so pleased with the software. Then one week later I tried to do some more transferring and now it won't work. The picture freezes but the audio continues and there is a big green bar that shows up at the bottom of the screen. I emailed the support for Honestech and they would not help me with the problem because the cord I was using to connect the VCR to my computer was not a Honestech product and I cannot get a refund either so I am out the money and have a product that does not work. I guess my biggest disappointment is with the support team not helping me. Not sure if my problem is the cord or not because it did work the prior week but the software is great if it would just work.
1,"I have done my taxes the last two years with Turbo Tax discs, both have failed and had to have customer service complete the filing. I have been told the download version runs better."
0,"I read all the positive and negative reviews. However, associating with the light users with positive reviews, I took a chance and purchased the downloadable version. This is where the scam begins. The Quicken instructions say you must convert your data to Mac base if you are using a PC. It further provides instructions that if you are using an older version of Quickens like mine, a 2003 version, it says to convert your data \\""insert the Quicken Essentials disc in your PC which should automatically boot up\\"". HELLO??? I don't have a disc . . . I just downloaded the app.  So I searched through the Quicken Essentials for Mac app for help. It gives me three options: email Quickens, eChat Quickens, or call Quickens. I chose to eChat and described my issue about not having a disc. I got immediate eChat response from someone named Rahul Ahlawat. He/she writes that it's an easy fix. Just click on this link (which was provided). I responded that I had already visited that site and that is where the instructions mentioned about inserting the disc. I get a response giving me another link that looks like this: [...]. It was beginning to sound like Rahul was giving me the runaround and did not have a ready answer. I then asked for a complete set of instructions all at once, not one step at a time. What do I get as a response?  Just click on this link (which was provided). It was the same \\""canned\\"" response earlier. Either he/she doesn't know he/she is talking about or I was \\""conversing\\"" with a voice recognition computer. Having realized that I got out of the website.  For this frustration, I'm contacting Amazon for a refund. I can't even comment on the application itself since I can't transfer over 15 yrs of info from my PC version of Quicken 2003. Yes. Like the other negative comments, I agree that Quicken has abandoned us long time faithful users. My recommendation is to look elsewhere for a personal financial app. Quicken isn't worth the $25 selling price. Neither is their helpline."
0,"Get out your useless 10-year-old MSN ID and password (or if you've forgotten, sign up for a new Microsoft account), cuz that's what you're going to need in order to download this software. If you create a new Microsoft account, be prepared to wait many minutes for the email verification from Microsoft, then somehow find your way back to the original sign-in-before-you-download screen. The download/registration process will waste your time and make you want to throw your laptop across the room.

1,says free but to do anything keeps urging upgrade which just keeps wanting more money for each add on which made it more then Norton's with 10 unit being covered  will whipe it off and install Norton's and kiss the 40 I spent good by seems like a bait and switch would no rec
1,The program just simply SUCKS......I am a long time MAC user and have loved the way this simply software worked in the past.....thought that after this many years of snubbing all us faithful users.....we finally had a great new version to work with.......WRONG.......It is the time for me to generate end of year reports.....I am doing my best to use the customer report feature.....using tags and categories  I want this to separate all my data.......I get NO good separation on all my splits......they all show up at the end of the report......and NOT in each tags area of the report..... WHAT the hell......it is a computer program.....it is suppose to be awesome at lists and separation of data......Anyone out there who can help......Otherwise I have to compile my reports by hand...WONDERFUL.........
2,"Original Review:  I purchased TurboTax Basic Windows version online, and downloaded it. I then installed the program and followed the instructions from Intuit to update the program.  The program simply does not work. The program will not load, gives and error message and a form to fill out to send to Intuit with a return email address. I received no reply from Intuit and there is no online source of support to solve this problem. I have tried 3 separate downloads and 3 variations on the installation and updates of the program.  None of them worked. Unfortunately, because I have already downloaded the file, Amazon does not give me a choice to return the faulty product, so I am stuck with a useless program.<br /><br />Hey Amazon! Did you read this? How about a refund policy for faulty software. I would be happy to upload this useless file back to you so you can see for yourself that it doesn't work!<br /><br />Re-Review: Many others have downloaded TurboTax Basic for Windows from Amazon with no problems, and I was not going to give up until I either received a new working version, instructions for how to fix the program, or figure out a solution on my own. After three email and phone attempts, I never even received a reply, much less a replacement file, from Intuit. With several hours of detective work searching internet forums, I found others who had similar problems with Intuit products and this eventually led me to a faulty Microsoft update for Microsoft.NET Framework 4 Extended(x64)for Windows 7 Pro (x64). Unfortunately, to fix the problem required a complete clean install of Windows 7(x64)and a re-install of all my software to find out that, yes, indeed the TurboTax Basic Windows installed and functions as advertised .... on machines which were fortunate to not get the buggy Windows update. I blame Microsoft for the problem, not Intuit. It would be helpful, however, if Intuit had a Customer Service department with a pulse."
2,I find it very difficult to use.  I was looking for something to replace Microsoft Picture Manager. Eventually I&#34;ll learn it.
1,"Taking over doing a lion share of the cooking in my house demanded that, as a Husband, and father, I make more meals than mac and cheese, hamburger helper and ordering out.  I read the reviews for this cookbook, and I decided to give it a chance.  I'm truly not all that crazy about it. Being a former program writer, I thought this would be more intuitive than it is.  The recipes are not as many as I would have liked. There is one cookbook included that is for cooking big meals. Great idea, but I don't know when I will be serving 50 people. I do like the being able to make more or less servings and having the recipe automatically adjusted. It has a great database of terms, measurements to get you started when you enter your own recipes into the program. I have an issue with the fact that it connects to the website and appears to share your recipe. Sharing recipes, okay, but what else? The main menu seems to bring you to the website right away. It is good with features but not so good in instructions. For example, I am still not to clear I know all there is to know about entering my own recipes, I am sure there must be a easier way, or there is a lot of room for improvement on that user interface.  I find that after searching in Mastercook, I end up searching the web for other recipes, too. It may just be me.<br />Will I use the program? I bought it, I'll definitely use it.  Do I like the recipes I've used? Undeniably yes! Is it easy to work with? Depends. If you want to use all the features it carries, it is not an easy task. If you just want to use the recipes that it already has, great! Would I recommend the program? That is a tough question.  I guess if I had the option to try it before I buy it, I would not have bought it, and continued to search. Having bought it, I'll make it work and it is scalable to the point of adding recipes, printing them out, etc. The grocery list is helpful but it leaves helpful information out. For example, if the recipe calls for sliced black olives, it will say 1 can.  Not too helpful if you are looking at several different sizes of cans of sliced Black Olives.. should it be 6 oz, 12, 16 oz? They have other options that cost more money, to use it online.<br /><br />Nov 23, 2016 - I've not been able to use the software. It won't open at all.  On Windows 10.  This program is becoming too troublesome to be useful.ed black olives, it will say 1 can.

3,"Just purchased the H & R Block Deluxe + State version.  I was a long term TT user but this year I switched to H&R Block due to receiving a better value (price & features).  The download was easy and the import from TT went well.  I would give 5 stars but I have not utilized all of the features yet.  In addition, it seems that TT cut back on the features of their Deluxe version and the customer ratings have plummeted so this also swayed my decision to purchase H & R Block's Deluxe software.  I'll update my review once I have filed my Federal & State returns."

4,I needed a new version of security since I had total defense and found that disappointing.  I loved the fact I could use it for my tablet as well.
1,"Very slow compared to 2013 version. Also, major issue when using multiple screens in that it doesn't display correctly when the screen resolution of the secondary screen is larger than that of the primary one."
2,"I downloaded this for my MacBook Air 13.3&#34; after being extremely dissatisfied with Quicken Essentials for Mac (tiny font and limited functionality).  To my dismay, this program also had extremely small fonts in its &#34;transactions&#34; screen (where I spend 99% of my time) which cannot be enlarged.  Views can be enlarged in the &#34;help&#34; screen -- great -- but that is not where I really need readable fonts.  The final blow came when I tried updating my bank/account data.  Some accounts downloaded okay, but there were problems with others.  I knew that it would take hours or weeks of dealing with tech support or waiting for bug fixes to get everything working fine so I ended up returning my MBA.  Keeping track of my finances is too important and my time too stretched to deal with this kind of nonsense.  I will be returning to pc-land where I can use Quicken which admittedly is far from perfect but at least allows for the enlargement of fonts in the transactions mode and allows for account updating so long as you stick to a more established version of Quicken. (one of my banks has yet to modify its configurations to allow for smooth updating in Quicken 2014)."
0,"ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS--slimy business from a company I trusted. Never will again.<br /><br />I installed Avast Internet Security (paid version) on a brand new computer less than a year ago. Recently started getting messages that the subscription was due to expire. I'd been fine with Avast, so renewed for 2 years ($49.99). The program reinstalled and updated.<br /><br />Next morning when I checked it, there was a message saying the firewall was turned off. The &#34;turn on / resolve&#34; buttons didn't work. I looked online for a fix, tried repair options etc, no luck.<br /><br />So I called their support. After a long runaround, what it came down to was this. They said my computer (less than a year old, very lightly used) was rife with &#34;error&#34; messages, and the firewall can't be turned on until those are eradicated. They will do this for $119 per single pop, $179 for a year service.<br /><br />To encapsule: I paid fifty bucks in good faith to continue a service I'd been receiving. Now they tell me that in order to get that service, I must pay 119-179 more.<br /><br />This is not exactly bait and switch, but along those lines. If I were an attorney, I'd be looking hard at it.<br /><br />I will add that I am a novelist, and in my book Dead Silver, I posit an afterlife realm known as Pissant Purgatory, where those who pull this kind of greasy stuff spend endless periods of time in bleak industrial cafeterias, with no sustenance but weeks-old lukewarm coffee--but by far the worst punishment is that they have no one to talk to but each other."
2,"I've been another software user for several years and decided to give H&R Block a try after a software snafu with the State last year.  While this software is somewhat straightforward when entering data, I did not find it nearly as user friendly.  I am not an accountant, nor am I up on what forms need to be submitted when mailing in returns.  I printed out what the program automatically set up in the print queue only to then read the directions provided by the program and find out I needed an additional form.  I had to go back in and spend time searching for the additional form.  I will be going back to my previous software."
3,We have been using quicken for years- and find it so helpful & easy to navigate!
2,"The fonts leave a LOT to be desired. Fortunately, I got this on sale for $29.99. At that price, it is an okay (on the minimal side) purchase. Even one cent more is way too much.<br />The vast majority of these fonts cannot serve any real purpose."
3,Researched free antivirus software including checking to see what Consumer Reports had to say. Decided on trying avast on a new laptop. It worked so well that I installed in on our remaining laptops and desktop in addition my android cell phone. It has worked flawlessly.
2,good
0,"Photoshop USED to be the name at the top for digital art, but they've failed EPICALLY with this membership program, and other companies are gonna eat up their customers like candy.  I'm just joining the other reviews on here to say NO WAY will I give my money for this ridiculous cash grab."
1,This new software is buggy to the point where I am considering dropping the use of Quicken.  I cannot download and manage my accounts properly after setting up a new file in Quicken 2014.  Have spent hours with Intuit reps and the problem still persists.
4,"Great product and user friendly, especially considering it was a free download."
0,"Mainly I'm reviewing to give this link:  [...]  This is what to do if you purchased Deluxe, found out it was NOT for homeowners, and then bought or upgraded to Premier (which I would not have done without the Prime discount and the refund bonus and the fact that H&R Block wants $40 for a state program).  And then you opened Premier on your Mac and it was still Deluxe!!    Otherwise- it's the same program for more money.  Easier to use than H&R block but only slightly.    1/22/14, lowered my rating.  After entering a LOT of charitable donations using \\""Various\\"" as the dates (because they were) I ran the error check.  Guess what?  Despite the program suggesting the use of Various here, it is no longer accepted, so now I have to go back through the donations and relist them by date, separately (I guess; they aren't very clear on that.)    I am really, truly disgusted with Turbotax and with their customer \\""service.\\""  I contacted them and said Homeowners buy and sell principle residences so that should be included.  The response?  Homeowners also run businesses so should Homeowner edition include businesses?  Huh??  What kind of answer is that?  Does the person who wrote me that really think that running an unrelated business is as much a part of home ownership as buying or selling the home is?"
2,I switched to Kaspersky in 2014.
0,Don't do it! Avoid all online pc repair unless you have $200 or more to spend. Go to a reputable pc repair or buy a book on fixing errors. Online pc repair is a racket!!
3,"Upgraded from H+B 2011. Resolved an issue where price history would be corrupted for several prior days, each time quotes were downloaded. Data entry for Split transactions took out a field (I've forgotten which) that I rarely used. That will be helpful once my fingers are retrained to only tab once from Memo to enter Amount.<br /><br />Have not encountered the negatives others have reported, but my usage may be less exotic than theirs."
2,"Lots of bugs; not much more than a glorified beta release.  Buy now if you must (sync with iPhone app is pretty good), but buy later if you can."
3,"This is a very good program, it detects viruses and malware on my wife's computer with ease..."
4,"I've used Kaspersky Internet Security for several years now, and depend on it to keep everything safe on my three laptops.  Kaspersky is #2 in the world behind Bitdefender; up until just recently, Bitdefender was really not &#34;easy to use&#34;.  They've recently improved their UI, so that it is easier to use.  Kaspersky has also improved their UI, and it gets easier to set up and use every year.  It's excellent security, and as a tech with over 40 years of experience in the computer world, I can highly recommend it for anyone who needs a top-notch security program."

2,"Has become too expensive.  Reduced features.  Adding a second state nearly doubles the cost, and electronic filing is an additional cost."
4,Great product
4,great for a free antivirus
2,"Intuit should be very concerned about the tenor of these reviews.  Right now Quicken has a monopoly on the market, but there is every indication that customers are dissatisfied and grumpy about their experience with the product.  These are not the marks of a company with a great customer-facing culture.  Moreover, although I personally don't have any major complaints with Quicken, I can testify from first-hand experience trying to use the online customer support functions for Quicken (and trying to provide feedback to Intuit) that this further reinforces the impression that Intuit does not put in enough time thinking about the customer experience.  The customer support function is confusing, difficult to access, fragmented between different systems and slow.  For a company that was focussed on trying to create a fantastic customer experience (and establish strong customer loyalty), I would have expected different."
3,I had no issues completing my taxes with this software. I recommend for those who are diligent about reading directions.
4,"The ONLY complaint I have is in regard to the &#34;schedule payment/deposit&#34;...The previous version I was using allowed for you to schedule stuff to be done on the 2nd Wednesday, or 3rd Monday, etc...This version 2013 does not allow for that. It only lets you schedule for a specific day of the month. We pay all our bills on the 2nd Wednesday of each month (Husband;s payday). Of course, the 2nd Wednesday is different each month. It may be the 14th of one month and the 10th on another. I now have to schedule everything to pay on the 15th because I know the money will be in the bank at that time."
2,"I've been using Quicken for Mac for years; I reconcile all my credit card, checking, savings, car loans... it's my central brain.<br /><br />So I was delighted when we (finally!) could sync with the cloud, and enter expenses on the go from my phone. But also disappointed in that:<br />1. In order to do that, I have to sync my account to it's server, which takes FOREVER on this version. You can't, for example, enter a receipt on the iphone and have it sync with your desktop - unless you sync to the account online. Which for me has had some mistakes.<br />2. How slow it runs. My previous ver ('05) was pretty snappy.<br />3. The font and layout is \\""big.\\"" It takes up so much real estate on my screen with a lot of big fonts and open space. I'd prefer to be able to choose my font size so I can fit more info in my 13\\"" laptop screen.<br /><br />Other than that, I do like this program. I don't use the budgeting and other features, I just balance my checkbook, double-check credit card charges, and output reports at the end of the year for my tax preparation."
0,"OK I admit i dont upgrade Quicken every year but generally every other year for many years now. I did not find any compelling reason why i should upgrade from Quicken 2010 to 2013 until I was foreced to. I was warned that I will not be able to download the financial transactions. OK, so arm twisting did work. I downloaded 2013. First issue; they charged me full price. I must have done something wrong so did not get $20 discount. Second issue; even after spending more than an hour with Quicken tech suport chat, i am still not able to download my bank transactions. Then I tried my bank for support, no success. I have not tried anything else yet because I am still stuck at the first step."
0,"I have used Turbo Tax for years and now you change what is include on this software and did not make buyers aware of the change, now if we want to change to higher priced software for which we thought we were getting to start with is a very bad business move. I will not upgrade, nor will I ever buy Turbo Tax again. Barbara Alford- 33917 Silver Pine Drive, Leesburg, Florida 34788"
0,This was a complete waste of money.  Please don't waste your time or money on this.
1,"Have not been able to download the program.  I let it run all night and it still says &#34;finding download&#34;.  I guess it can't find the app to download.  Glad I didn't have to pay cash for this download.  Need to revise this review.  Once I install the Amazon downloader, it loaded and was installed immediately.  However, I still haven't figured out how to access and use the checkbook, which is the only thing I wanted to use."
4,This is the first time I use TurboTax.  I like it a lot.  it is user friendly.  A first rate product all around.
4,I've been doing my taxes with TurboTax for years and this year was no different - except that I downloaded the program from Amazon instead of buying the CD.  It was quick and easy to understand.
0,Buy another product.......No Refund if not happy with it.....AVOID.....I got one But you Won't....
0,Don't work on XP
3,"I Like It!!!!<br />Very pleased, had been using 2009, a few nice little features have been added.<br />Been using Quicken since 2001, can't imagine using any other product."
3,"Not as flexible as older versions, and harder to set up templates, but overall the improvements still make it worth moving to the new program"
4,Best free Antivirus on the net. I have used other in the past but they can't do the job of keeping my computer clean or as fast as Avast can.
1,"It's nothing compared to kidpix, hard for a 5 year old to navigate."
0,This is not the desktop version that I thought I was getting. This review has been rejected twice already. There are no returns allowed on this product.
3,"Very good system, does a lot more than I need. Some disappointment with reports/categories, which I need to clean up."
1,"The only reasaon I gave this version of the program the two stars that I did, was because of the quality of the personal tax program.  If I were to grade only the personal portion of this version it would be in four to four and half stars range.  The personal side of the program works very and is worth the money and is available by itself in a seperate version [[ASIN:B0068TJE4A H&R Block At Home Premium + State 2011 Win [Download]]].  But I did not purchase this program for just the personal tax preparation, I purchased this specific version to handle a business return.  When you install this version of the program you are actually installing two seperate programs, the personal and business tax preparation programs.  Which makes some sense, I suppose.  What makes no sense though is wide divergence in quality between the two programs.  The business return preparation looks like a half thought out version of the personal program (seriously it looks like it should have \\""version .01\\"" listed somewhere).  On the personal side of things you have the option of viewing the whole tax form that is being filled out, not so with the business program.  It's always right there in front of you taking up two thirds of your screen.  Which makes me wonder why not just go to [...] then print the form, then fill it out by hand.  But, putting aside the clunky entry system and the overall appearance, good luck trying to print the return into a pdf (it comes with it's own pdf writer).  The pdf writer can be used by other programs and works well WITH OTHER PROGRAMS but for some reason does not seem to work with the business program.  My favorite moment however, was having the program tell me that there was no interview available for South Carolina, despite the fact that I had not only download and installed the South Carolina state version but was also able (after some searching) to pull up the SC Corporate return.  What a disappoinment."
0,"I bought this primarily to track expenses now that I'm entering retirement.  I've been using Mint.com and PersonalCapital.com (free, online tools) to do this - and they work great, but I bought Quicken as I'm a little uncomfortable having all my financial information on someone's website.  Anyway, both Mint and PersonalCapital report all my account balances accurately while Quicken 2014 does not.  The online help system and forum are useless.  I believe I've wasted my money on this product.  Quicken was a favorite of mine in previous years for balancing my checkbook, but Intuit appears to have broken Quicken, with the online functionality.  (Actually Mint.com has been recently purchased by Intuit - I hope they don't break that.)"
0,Thanks to all those customers who provided feedback.....worthy of note is that there is not ONE positive comment.  These saved me from what was likely to be a disastrous mistake.  I will NOT be updating my Quicken Rental Property Manager this year....I will be looking for some other software package.
2,Would be a great thing for kids to use on their phones or ipads. Great program for newbies for sure.
2,I have been using Turbo Tax since I bought a the very first edition directly from Michael Chipman in 1983.  All I can say is the program has gotten much more bloated and cumbersome.  It is like a child that has simply got fat and out of shape over time.  Yes it does the job but the program has become somewhat of a kludge since it was taken over by Intuit many years ago.
1,I still have a virus.  Maybe I am not sure how it works?
0,I have had nothing buy trouble with this!! Nothing works as it should. I will never buy a download  ever again from Amazon!!
1,"I upgraded from Quicken 2012.  For my use, there is no benefit. Overall, it is quite a bit slower, especially when starting.  Several elements seem less straightforward such as online updating.  I think it was a mistake to upgrade."
0,"My attempted download resulted in my computer pulling in some malware/virus that drove me to restore the computer to a date prior to the attempted download. As a result I never got Word. I did however pay Amazon and I spent hours and dollars restoring my computer. Never, NEVER, again will I attempt to download any program. There are too many creeps out there with malice aforethought to allow free enterprise to work here."
0,"Wanted a word processor to replace Pages in my Mac.  Tried several times to<br />download program but would not download.  Reviewed Mac Pages a bit more and decided don't need another processor.  Program is probably OK,  give a one star because of download problem!"
3,One of their better programs.
4,"Easy to use, does everything that Office or Word does and it's free? Need I say more?"
2,"It works pretty well over all.  They ding you for an extra $20 for state e-filing, which I don't particularly like, they could be more up front on this.  Also, there was a question on how long your dependents lived with you through the year that didn't &#34;require&#34; answering, but when I overlooked it, it wouldn't let me file as head of household, so there are some user friendliness issues as well.  I was just doing a simple no deductions return and it took me about an hour."
3,"I've used TaxAct before and found it reliable.  My taxes are a bit complicated with a Subchapter S and a LLC, and investments that pay dividends. I also have to pay income taxes in two states.<br /><br />But I have been doing my own taxes for so long that I have a good grasp of the basics and know where to look for changes. Recommended for those who have some understanding of taxes and don't need a more complicated tax software package."
3,"I chose to buy my Norton renewal from Amazon as it was much cheaper than the $59.00 Norton wanted for its renewal.<br />Had a bit of trouble getting it authorized, but think that was just my problem.  I have used Norton 360 for several years and are very pleased with it.  Use it on my two laptops."
1,"This review is strictly for the download/install process. It's terrible. Save yourself the hassle and order the boxed software instead. But if you have already bought the download and are experiencing the issues others are writing about - that it asks you for the language level discs and won't let you continue....the trick is - uninstall then re-install. But then, when you get to the point where it asks you to check updates- DO NOT CHECK FOR UPDATES. Select wait until later. Once you do that it will ask if you want to download and install the language levels. It's a three pack, so it repeats the language level download 3 times. Then it asks you for the product key (which is the same for all three). The key can be found in &#34;Your Software Library&#34;<br /><br />Now to find out what the program is actually like....."
4,Have always used Norton and same great program.
4,Great
1,I think the way they did this year was terrible.  They changed the Turbo Tax Deluxe and eliminated a lot of things I used for other peoples taxes that I did for them.  Such as business.  They should have sent people e-mails to warn them but they did not.  Not very Happy this year :(
3,"I&#34;ve had AVAST antivirus for 3yrs  , not one problem with it . I put it on every computer in our house ."
3,Norton works well and Amanzon is a great way to buy it. Saved s considerable amount versus buy direct. Would recommend it to a friend.
2,An economical alternative to Photoshop Elements-Diversity and surprising quality. A very nice gift . Great Value for Money.Bravo!<br />Will buy again
2,Too much work to get it to download
1,the lessons were not iPod ready and I needed. internet access . It just wasn't what I was looking for in a program.
0,"This software is too basic. There are no hotkeys (keyboard shortcuts) for quick and easy editing. It's a steroid enhanced version of iMovie and or Windows movie maker. Although Windows may be easier to cut and trim with than Corel.<br />If you know nothing of editing other than iMovie, this is for you.<br />If you are looking for inexpensive more advanced/traditional editing software that correlates more with Avid/FinalCut/Adobe, than this is not for you.<br />I ciberlink has customizable hotkeys that makes timeline editing quick and easy. I'm going to trial that.<br />I'd say trial them first. I should have.... I just spent a worthless 50$"
0,"could not download online, wasted my money with no refund."
1,The new platform is t as good as the old where you could actually access your files and browse now you have to download files to even check them
2,Yes I like it . It is easy and pretty fast only thing I didn't like was paying first for the turbo tax and then having to pay again for the state.
0,"What a horrible software that it asks me to upgrade to Premium for correcting cost basis that I just entered few key strokes back. I have now come to know about the free Premium upgrade plan and such, but since I don't use their horrible E-file service ( I just print and mail ), I am at a loss. They don't have my SSN is their &#34;system&#34; to validate me as having been their customer from the past."
4,"I don't like having to pay each year for this software I purchased 20 years ago.  I don't believe when I first bought this software that  having to purchase upgrades each year was part of the agreement. Good thing Microsoft doesn't do this or we would all be broke!,"
1,"Okay first off the software works pretty good, it does my taxes correctly and helps you along the way.  That wasnt the problem I had with this product.  I tried to e-file my federal taxes and it Rejected my taxes - this is a problem with the IRS; it stated my ssn was already used to submit a tax return for 2009 - NOT TRUE.  So later the next day I get another email from Intuit saying my tax return was now Accepted by the government.  This is the email you get when your taxes were efiled properly.  So I thought - why would my tax return get rejected then for no reason just get accepted.  I called Intuit and they told me that my taxes were in fact filed properly and received by the government.  Here's the kicker; even if your taxes are rejected your bank information is sent along to the IRS.  They withdrew thousands from my bank but rejected my tax return.  Why would turbotax forward payment information if the tax return fails??  Or better yet why would the government take the money if they dont accept the return?   Intuit even have the nerve to give me some DCN (declaration control number) claiming it as the receipt of my tax return being accepted by the gov.     So I'm skeptical and called the IRS today (4/13/2010) and ask them if they received my tax return from last Thursday.  The woman there tells me - NO your tax return was rejected, but we do see your bank payment.  She advised me to go ahead and mail my tax return in.  Thank you TurboTax for emailing me a misleading and false letter saying the tax return was accepted by the government; and then furthering this by telling me by phone not to worry that my taxes were indeed accepted - when all along they never were.    The moral of the story - check the DCN on your tax return; if it is blank then the IRS did not receive your tax return and you should call the IRS; do not trust what TurboTax or Intuit tell you.  Better yet use the other tax software from 'the block'; I used that product for years and tried to getthis one a shot; I am going back to it next year as this has been a nightmare."
0,"code did not work, what a joke."
0,Having problems with update. Now cannot scan due to error on update. On line instructions are different to my Admin setup.  Upsetting because I am not a tech.
1,"There are so many frustrating bugs that I'm considering giving up on even tracking my finances with this kind of software.  The investing reports give random and useless values.  Transfer transactions cannot be deleted.  It crashes regularly. And often when I shut it down, it leaves files locked so that I have to reboot before I can run it again.<br /><br />Considering that they add no noticeable enhancement each year, it seem that even a slightly competent development team could have fixed these issues by now.  I can only imagine that everyone at intuit is completely apathetic."
2,"Office on a Mac works fine. I'm not a heavy user. I use Word very little, mostly if a client provides a file forcing me to use it. I use Excel quite a bit and it runs smoothly on my MBP and is very functional. The other programs of the Office suite I don't use much at all and can't say much for or against them."
4,"As usual, the product downloads and installs without any problem.  The tax software itself is perfect for anyone with simple or complex investment tax situations, including the dreaded K-1's.  Very detail-oriented software with plenty of online support."
4,"I use Avast as my antivirus program since Microsoft stopped supporting XP.  Great program for keeping your computer protected.  Automatically update your updates.  Also, alerts you when other programs updates become available.  Highly recommend avast to others."
4,"The download was fast and within a few minutes, I was able to start preparing my taxes.  Overall, I spent less money on the purchase and was able to start my taxes in far less time than driving to the store to make the same purchase."
4,"Much less of a resource hog than previous versions. Nearly transparent operation and updates. Identity Safe is the best part for me, 100s of passwords with one logon."
1,"First, let me say that I love TurboTax.  I have been using it for years to do my taxes and it has made it relatively painless.  Up until now, if you purchase the Deluxe version you get free Federal e-file, because the IRS does not charge for this service.  Remember when they did?  TurboTax used to charge a fee.  But, now they don't because the IRS doesn't.<br /><br />So, the State of California sent out notices this year saying that they have free e-filing.  I assumed that when I did an automatic upload of any changes to the taxes this year that TurboTax would also upload the fact that the State of California has free e-filing.  However, they still charge an extra $20 for e-filing the State return.  I looked at their community question and answer sections<br />, and it appears that many states now offer free e-filing, and other tax payers also assumeD that meant TurboTax would file their state return for free.  However, TurboTax just takes the $20 out of your tax refund.<br /><br />So, if they don't change things next year, without increasing the price on their software, I will no longer be purchasing TurboTax.  If I have to fill out the same information a second time on the State of California tax website, why do I need TurboTax?<br /><br />DOWN WITH THE $20 FEE TO E-FILE THE STATE!"
4,I have used this software now for 4 years and just finished my taxes last week. It was great!
0,TT Deluxe was all I've needed for years.  I would just look for the best price.  This year they moved some of the schedules that were previously included in Deluxe to the Premiere and Home/Office software at a MUCH higher price.  Next year it will not be TurboTax.  Unbelievably stupid move!
0,"For the past dozen years or so, we have used both TurboTax and TaxCut (now H&R Block) at times.  However, over the last few years, we have only been using TurboTax as we had found it to be the best option for us.<br />This year, as we were preparing to make our tax software purchase in late January, we really thought hard about maybe not going with TurboTax given some of the complaints that were occurring at that time.  But just as we were deciding, two things happened.  First, we learned about the opportunity to get some of our return back in form of an Amazon gift card; second, inuit appeared to be trying to make things right around the issues folks were facing.<br />So we decided to go with TurboTax.<br /><br />We now wish we would have done anything other than that.<br /><br />First, it kept wanting to force me to do my state property tax refund application in order to complete my state income tax return, only the state had not yet communicated everything I needed to do this and these two things are not connected in any way.  Eventually, I had to just enter all 0's to get it to process and then as it finally did, I got a notification that the state had not yet completed its property tax application (its not due until the fall), so it was not complete nor eligible to be submitted.<br />Good thing I was forced to complete it and spent 30 minutes trying to figure out how to get around it!<br /><br />Second, we live in Minnesota, so as we were finishing our filing, word came down that Minnesota had stopped accepting applications due to fraud issues.  So here we were, wondering what was going to happen to our return...in fact, we still are.  We have heard that they are now filtering through, but that they anticipate some having to be re-filed.<br />Fingers crossed!<br /><br />Third, we got word that our federal return was completed, accepted, and our refund would be deposited within days.  Then we get a communication from intuit on the day of deposit that our funds were now available, but we would not be receiving our Amazon gift card because the IRS had adjusted our refund.<br />So here we are wondering two things...what happened to all these levels of checks that occurred to prevent any discrepancies?  And just how much was our return changed to cancel our gift card offer?<br /><br />While we still have no idea about the discrepancy checks, we did get our refund deposited and eagerly checked to see just how much it was affected that we couldn't get our gift card.<br />To our amazement, our refund was reduced by a whopping $.14.  To reiterate, that is fourteen cents!  Not $14 dollars, not $114 dollars, not even $1.40, but FOURTEEN CENTS!<br />To give some added perspective, our gift card request was less than 20% of our total refund and $.14 would not affect it at all.  But apparently, it was enough for them to cancel our order, not explain the discrepancy, and not be available in any reasonable amount of time to respond to our questions.<br /><br />Never again will we use intuit!"
1,"I've been using Quicken since the very original Dos version.  I used to upgrade every year but now only upgrade every other year.  This new version like the last has many bugs.  I'm sure they'll fix them but it's a shame they don't fix the big hairy bugs before they release the product.  The only reason I upgraded this year was to sync with the Iphone APP.  Every time I sync with the Iphone app my balances change dramatically and erroneously.  I have restored from backup and retried this many times.  Also, the syncing either crashes or takes WAY too long.  Tech support at Inuit has been horrific for years so I haven't tried it yet.  I will try later but have little hope they will have any clue.  Many online discussion boards list many people with this same issue who have called Intuit and received no help.  Very disappointed."
4,"Before I bought this product, I read most of the reviews. The bad ones, had me concerned and almost dissuaded me from purchasing the product.  However, I did buy it, and my experience was most pleasant. I followed the instructions, and within one week had my .edu address confirmed, password received and Adobe running. I love the easy of the program. It is much faster to learn and a cleaner and better product in totality."
0,I have used Turbo tax for years but I am very unhappy with this years product. I spent over four hours entering data and up popped a screen saying we have to verify everything is up to date and I lost everything. This happened twice. I emailed  turbo tax but they have not responded. I am switching to another product. I am not entering all this data again to have it disappear. Turbo Tax you have lost me as a customer.
1,"I completed a return using both HR and TT online and cannot imagine using this program if you have any investment income or take any credits.  The first and most basic problem was that HR couldn't download my 1099-DIV or 1099-B from my bank.  It is one of the largest banks in the country, and TT had was able to import.  I'd check online to see if HR (or TT) can import from your bank or you will spend a lot of time doing what you are trying to avoid by buying this!      Second, HR was unclear about capital gains and losses.  Had I used only HR, I very well could have reported a gain instead of a loss! To be fair, if it had imported the forms, it might have figured it out.  Even once I figured out where to enter the various numbers, I used the numbers from TT instead of entering the cost basis for every small transaction (and to calculate the basis with HR you'll have to use another (free) program).     Generally, the HR program is clunky:  TT asks you questions and tells you what your answer means; HR just tells you to click if you qualify for the \\""1044 exemption for standing on your head.\\""  I've done my taxes on my own every year til now, and HR was basically the same thing.  In the end, because investment income is confusing -even if you have a small amount- it is well worth paying for a program. But I'm very glad I didn't try to use HR's program.  The extra $20 for TT is money well spent."
1,this program is not for my pc and getting help is near to impossible
2,"Product works fine.<br />The process to download was AWFUL.... couldn't download, couldn't find anything on Microsoft website. Ended up having to call tech support to get it downloaded and installed.. Took about 1.5 hours..."
0,I had to upgrade twice while preparing my tax returns - and the Rebate from Turbo Tax didn't cover the extra expense - they promised it wouldn't cost any more.
2,Love / hate relationship with Quicken for Mac
2,I have used Quicken for Windows for years and finally decided to switch to Quicken for MAC.  While it is taking a little time to see how to do the same things in the MAC version as the Windows version I think Intuit is going in the right direction.  I was hoping the MAC version would have finally caught up with the Windows version but they still have some work to do.
2,"Quicken gets more and more bloated with each release.  I just need to categorize transactions and balance my checkbook.  Intuit appears bent on having you depend on their &#34;value added&#34; cloud services that marginally work. I am never going to surrender my account and personal financial information to you.  Intuit, please keep it simple and quick."
3,"I've used Turbo Tax since it came out, Quicken before that from the time it came out for Windows. I'm tired of their limitations, desperate to keep customers. So I tried H & R Block this year. It was a lot cheaper and it went a lot faster. It imported last year's Turbo Tax file and moved on. I was literally done before I knew it. I suspect Turbo Tax asks too many questions for simple returns."
2,"I find this program confusing to use. I have used The Print Shop for many years and have always enjoyed it. But this one is so different. I will use it as my The Print Shop 23 will not work in Windows 8.1, this one does, but I do find a few glitches in it.  I make all my cards for family and friends on it. It isn't bad, just changed so much from Print Shop 23."
4,"DOWNLOADED SUPER EASY. WE'VE USED TURBO TAX FOR YEARS NOW, BUT BUYING THROUGH AMAZON HAS BEEN ECONOMICAL AND CONVENIENT. NO PROBLEMS."
0,"Bought this for a great deal from Amazon. Since I work in a different State from the State I live in, I had to buy an additional State program for almost twice the price that I paid for this software. At the time, I figured it was not a big deal since I bought this software at a great price. This all changed when I found out that I could only e-file one state return and I would have to mail in the other. Upon contacting support, they were unable to help me and in the end the resolution was that e-filing multiple states was just not supported. I might switch back to Turbo Tax next year."
4,Works great. Down loaded on time and installed easily. Converts to several formats easily allowing changing format of your coice.
0,"You want to be forced to open a Microsoft acct?  You want to have absolutely no support from Amazon?  Do you want to have absolutely no way of returning this compromised inferior, problematic program?  You want a couple of hundred download issues which seem to take forever to solve?  Read the other reviews Please.  I messed up.  I needed the program and trusted Amazon to stand by this product.  They don't.  Neither does their &#34;software and games&#34; download utility.  This is a review and my opinion only but accurately reflects my experience.  I should have simply burned the $115, it would have been simpler and less time consuming."
2,"Wouldn't let me open saved files for the longest time, other than that no problems."
1,"I have to say, overall I am pleased with the product but really disappointed in the misrepresentation and customer service. I ordered this after getting QuickBooks Pro, which didn't work well for me at all. I went with Sage for the inventory management system they had. I was specifically told this one had the ability to do multiple units of measure, and even in the user manual it had directions on multiple units of measure. This is the main reason why I purchased this. The directions, however, didn't match the product. The product itself has NO MULTIPLE UNITS OF MEASURE. I was pretty upset when I discovered this as I spoke with the Sage representative prior to purchasing. I called Sage again to see why it didn't have what I needed. I was told that this version didn't have it, that the version before did. If I wanted multiple units of measure, I have to purchase Quantum (which is a few thousand dollars) and they consistently tried to upsell me. I was transferred 8 times on the phone over and over, and nothing was solved. I was told I would get a call the following Monday, and no one called me back. I never received another call. I called them a few times after and still nothing had been resolved.<br /><br />I feel really disappointed with the customer service of this. I think I will use this product for a little bit, but I will probably switch to something else. I hate that I use it now, but I paid money for it and don't want that to go to waste. Overall, Sage 50 Pro is okay, but the customer service is awful. I would not recommend the company."
3,i know i'ts a good antivirus program.
1,"So disappointed with this software right now.  There are two different issues I had.<br />1) Downloading it from Amazon wouldn't work.  Quicken customer service was extremely helpful.  It took a 2 1/2 of hours of working with them but eventually the gave me a new version and I was able to get it down loaded.  Though it took almost four hours from the time I bought to get it working, I was very happy with the help they gave me.<br /><br />2) I am having so much trouble connecting and downloading transactions from my bank!  The very first time I connected and signed in the setup worked.  I made the mistake (which isn't technically a mistake) of changing the account names at my bank.  After that, I've never been able to get the transactions to download.  I have deleted ALL of my bank accounts, hoping that starting from the beginning again would work but I can't get anything to work.  I have a bunch of one step update temp files but as of now (after 6 tries) can't get my accounts added again from my bank.<br /><br />3) 75% of the time I connect to my bank the program eventually freezes up and I have to use task manager to close it out.<br /><br />I was REALLY hoping to be able to be using this program on a regular basis by now.  :("
1,"I have used Quicken for over 10 years, (because they are the only game in town), and Quicken continues on the path of minimal new features each year while ignoring customer requests for improvements.  Frankly the only reason I upgraded was because they lock you out of downloading from your bank after 3 years.  I upgraded from 2012.  The upgrade when just fine and took only a few minutes.  This is the one good thing I have to say.  But there are almost no new features of any significance to me after 3 years.  Yes they have added some cloud features, but I would NEVER put my financial information in the cloud unless I am the only one controlling the encryption.  Usability issues I have been complaining about to Quicken for 3 years remain unfixed.  Specifically - I scan and store all my purchase receipts, bills, etc., in Quicken, hundreds of scans per year.  Each scan requires clicking on the same choices in 3 different dialog boxes.  I have asked repeatedly for some method to shorten this process as I give exactly the same answers to the same questions hundreds of times per year, but I have been ignored by Quicken for years.  Also, like other reviewers I would like to see the lifetime planner updated as it has remained virtually unchanged for years.<br /><br />Tech support continues to be slow and takes a long time.  I found a small bug and reported it, and I had to go through five agents over several weeks, before Quicken finally acknowledged that there was a problem. But all they have told me is that they MIGHT address it in a future release.<br /><br />As I said, Quicken has no real competition, and they know it, as evidenced by their lack of innovation year in and year out, and their poor customer service.  Yes the program does work for what I need, and the upgrade went without issues, hence the two stars.  But if they had any real competition I would be gone in a minute."
0,"Pathetic that you need to pay a monthly subscription to use software, and not have an option to buy it. Would give it zero stars if I could..."
3,"I'm disappointed that the version of Turbo Tax I normally use came without Sch. D.  I will be careful to check next year to make sure all of the schedules I need are included.  I have used TurboTax for a number of years and have been satisfied.  I don't want to switch, but there are others now with the same features."
1,"Had difficulty, more confusing than years past"
4,Awesome love it
4,Have used Norton for years. This is a good value
2,Not as user friendly as I would like. Had difficulty downloading it from the web site so had to order the hard copy
0,Never worked.  I even went through an uninstall and reinstall with the company.  It continued with the same error. Waste of time and money.
2,I was forced to buy the deluxe this year to cover my small business needs. I was not happy about the extra expense. Hopefully this will be remedied by next year.<br />I liked the lay out of the program and found it easy to use.
4,The paperback and hardcover was expensive! I found this and I loved it. There are quizzes to test your knowledge of the chapters. Extremely helpful if you are taking a government class or understand government. I would recommend this software to everyone!
0,"I do not recommend purchasing this product.  I was running Quicken Deluxe 2011 and decided to upgrade so I don't get too far out of date.  I now have no working version on my computer.<br /><br />When I attempt to open Quicken Deluxe 2014 I get an error box and when I close the box, Quicken closes.  Essentially, it just won't open.  I tried to troubleshoot on Google and Quicken forums.  I ran a fix on .NET Framework since that was recommended.  I downloaded the QcleanUI and MSIClean32 utilities to fully uninstall all Quicken programs and then re-installed.  Quicken Deluxe 2014 just won't open.  I keep getting the same error.<br /><br />I sent the error report to Quicken/Intuit as is recommended.  I even did the online chat support since this was after hours.  I believe I spent two to three hours with the online chat support person.  In the end they had me submit the error reports and Windows log for further review.<br /><br />At this point I just want my money back and I'm hoping I have the Quicken Deluxe 2011 disk so I can re-install that.<br /><br />UPDATE on 12-31-2013:  I did still have my Quicken Deluxe 2011 disk so I re-installed it.  I got an error the first time I opened.  I forgot that the 2014 install had converted my .QDF file to the new format.  I just had to pull out the old 2011 .QDF file.  Then the next time I tried to open I got some other kind of error (sorry, I didn't notice what it was).  But then I tried one more time to open and it opened.  It appears to be fine.  I did some investment updates and the data looks okay.<br /><br />I'm still going to pursue a refund.  I've already spent approximately four hours trying to get 2014 to work (including the two to three hours with the online chat support person).  And from the reviews that state there's not much (if any) new functionality, I just don't think it's worth the time and frustration.  I'll consider upgrading next year because I don't like to get too far behind on versions.<br /><br />UPDATE on 01-02-2014:  I decided to call Intuit to request my refund.  I wasn't sure if they'd authorize it any other way, so I just figured I'd start that way.  In order to get a phone number you have to fill out an online form with your question and e-mail address.  For my \\""question\\"" I stated I wanted a refund since I couldn't get it to install / start properly.  They then gave me an 800 number to call along with an incident number to reference.  When I called I got put ON HOLD FOR ALMOST AN HOUR (LITERALLY... OVER 50 MINUTES).  I finally had to hang up because I had other things to do.  I will have to call back.  I am considering just working through my credit card company to reject the charge.<br /><br />My software experience was extremely frustrating.  But I think my customer service experience has been even worse.  I really think I gave this a lot of effort (over four hours trying all sorts of fixes to get the software installed and running) and patience being on phone hold.<br /><br />UPDATE on 01-06-2014:  I am stuck at home today due to bad weather so I had the chance to call again to ask for my refund.  I can't really do this at work.  I was on hold for 10 minutes and got through to a person.  The Rep had no problem processing my refund (I have to believe they're doing a lot of this).  HOWEVER... they said they could not refund the sales tax I paid.  I know that at this point that's really nit-picky (it was $1.88), but I don't think I've ever returned something and not been refunded the sales tax.  I feel bad that I got a bit upset and was speaking harshly to the Rep (it's not his call, not his fault), but it seemed pretty stinky to me.  I pulled myself together an apologied to him, but I can't believe they're not going to refund my sales tax.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I'm glad to be done with this experience.  I think over the next few months I'll do some research for a new personal finance tool.  I've only been using Quicken since I installed Deluxe 2011.  Before that I was using Microsoft Money.  I started using it around 1997 (I think) and really liked it.  But they quit issuing new versions and didn't support it anymore.  But this is the world we live in... ever changing.  Thanks for following my experience... I hope it has helped others.<br /><br />UPDATE on 05-18-2014:  I am still looking for a replacement for Quicken but haven't settled on anything yet.  I have been researching free software such as gnucash and paid software such as AceMoney and YNAB (you need a budget).  One of the issues with most, if not all, of these pieces of software is the inability to download updates for retirement accounts.  I like the ease of doing that with Quicken.  However... as of April 30, 2014 I lost that ability with Quicken 2011 (which I had to go back to running when Quicken 2014 turned out to be a bust).  So maybe it's not so much of an issue now.  Some of the reading I've done also talks about some of the software tools not having the category management that Quicken does.  I'm really dependent on categorizing because I run lots of reports and do ad-hoc queries for purchases.  I've been using MS Money/Quicken since around 1998 so I have a lot of historical data that I want to continue querying and building.<br /><br />One thing I liked about AceMoney was it sounded like it had somewhat robust functionality.  The thing I didn't like it that it's more of an \\""international\\"" software.  One thing I liked about YNAB was it sounds like it's \\""homegrown\\"" (start-up from people in Utah) but it might not have as much functionality.  As for gnucash... I haven't done too much research yet.  Ultimately I'm a creature of habit.  Once I start using something I don't like to switch.  I have some technical knowledge, but it's just a hassle.  So I might end up using Quicken for a while longer.<br /><br />So for right now I'm continuing to use Quicken 2011 and simply update my retirement accounts manually (using a single / high-level number insteadof details per account).  It's not terrible.  And I do enjoy a lot of the other functionality it provides."
1,"I am disappointed in this product... I am always a little scare to pay and download a software program online... and ,....it does not work.. now I am out the $$$ .. How do I get my money back ????"
3,Great product
4,I have been using AVAST free download for several years and have never had a problem. This is a great anti virus software that I recommend often to friends.
1,Takes along time to run.  It is a 1 time scan for $10.  Would not buy again.
0,"Really nice.  States in name - Win 2 PDF right?  States in description convert files to PDF.  Shows in picture in description on this page a nice window with a drop down showing how you can select PDF to make a PDF.<br /><br />When you go to print - and select the new Win2PDF printer - your only option is a PRN file.  NO PDF option.  Nice, real nice.<br /><br />Seeking refund.  Not worth the money.  Windows 8 environment."
4,"I finally had to upgrade from QB 2010 after I had major issues trying to use it on a laptop with 64-bit Windows 7 installed.  I'll never use all the new features, but i was able to quickly restore my old data and convert it to the new database format."
0,"I have problems signing in, saving the information, navigating it and remote accesing it on my other computer. So Worthless!!!!!!"
2,"I love having excel again, way better than works. But I have a new computer and this program runs so slow that it is almost useless!"
0,I have bought PrintMaster before and used it for years but the v6 does not work. The Avery labels templates was very limited.<br />I have e-mailed PrintMaster about the problems but no reply. This has been very disappointing and frustrating.<br />This product has so been awaste of money.<br />Paul Stouff
2,"I didn't think it was as easy to use as the normal Photoshops.  I know people get used to what they are used to but if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't have purchased the product. For basic editing, it's fine.  But personally, this isn't my preference."
4,"I love avast! Of course, there's the &#34;free&#34; part, but I have far fewer problems, both with the program itself as well as the level of protection,  than I had with 4 different paid [some expensive] anti-virus programs. It catches a whole lot more than than my work computer. I'm a teacher, and get documents from hundreds of students... need I say more. Avast comes through every time."
3,"The program helped speed up my old pc.  I got the PC in 2005, and it needed some improvement in performance.  the software helped to remove spyware and adware.  it's been great."
1,"If I wasn't more or less forced to buy this 2013 edition, I would have stayed with the 2010 Edition.  The 2010 was  more user friendly.  I liked where I could reconcile myself."
0,Never could use it. Was no longer a student. For me unfortunately it ended up being a waste of money
2,I have used Microsoft Office before with the Windows but this is the first time I am using it with Mac OS. I really do not know why is it so expensive for the Mac OS. I had no other choice but to buy as I need the office applications.
3,"I see a lot of bad reviews on here, I have been using quicken or quick books since 1997, both are great products and this release has been no different.  Definite improvements from the last version (2013) that I was using.  I don't trust financial info on my mobile phone or tablets yet, so I don't use that feature, but everything else seems to work wonderfully.  Converting from the 2013 version was a breeze."
2,"I've used TurboTax for many years previously (which is great), and compared to that H&R block is just &#34;ok&#34;.  It did the basic stuff all right, but when I tried to get it to do anything out of the ordinary it's very awkward.  It also has that irritating feature (as does Turbo tax) of wanting an extra $20 just to e-file your state tax form.  It is a little cheaper than TurboTax but for the $10 or so I saved, I'll probably go back to TurboTax next year."
0,Product Code did not work!
1,"I used Turbotax to file my taxes, and while it was easy to use, I was especially annoyed to find that at the very end, if you have chosen to have a direct deposit of your refund, the bank tacks on a $30 service charge (in addition to what you have paid for the software. I new to expect, from reading the reviews, that the state return would not be included, but the bank fee was a shock. Also, I think when it calculated my state refund, it was not correct -- they did not include the tax for internet purchases that my state requires. I filed my own state taxes directly on the state's website, as I usually do. It is super easy once you have done your Federal taxes, you just have to copy across the information from a couple of lines. It already had all of my employer's information (unlike the Turbotax, where I had to type it all in)."
2,i was able to use product. however it did do what it promised. again i do not appresiate having to type more words based on your requirements.
2,"I have used Turbo Tax for years, but I thought H&R Block would be less expensive. H&R Block program did not work well with last year's Turbo Tax as others had stated. I am in an different situation as I needed an additional state program. The extra cost was expected, but cost more than I had previously paid with TT and I paid a fee to file the extra state also, the total was just over $60 extra.<br /><br />H&R Block was ok, some parts of the program were easy to use and some weren't."
4,It was easy to install and everything works as it should.
3,"Good product, great price on Amazon. Install not as easy as claimed, but done !"
1,"I just purchased Microsoft Office Home and Business 2010 for my new firm. I mainly got it for Word and Outlook. Word has been fine. Outlook has been anything but fine. I can access mail on my iPhone and on Outlook Web Access. However, I am unable to access my mail account through Outlook on my desktop. Apparently the issue is Outlook is delivering to an old file on my computer (the message I get says I have multilanguage Unicode issues- whatever that is). Godaddy has been very helpful in trying to resolve this Outlook issue. Microsoft's tech support phone number is virtually impossible to locate and once I contacted them I was told there was nothing they could do to help me. I paid $200+ for their non-working product 2 days earlier and they refuse to help make it work.    As I mentioned, if their product works, you may be in good shape. But if you have problems do not expect any acceptable level of support. Buy at your own risk   Dave"
3,"Overall, it's a pretty good software application.  If you follow the directions and go through all the questions, I think it's as good as any tax service."
0,"If i could, I would give it a Big Fat Zero. Typically I don't don't wright  reviews, especially if my thoughts are negative, but in this case I Have to make an exception.  For those of you who have used Print Master in the past, the first thing you will notice is that you can not open any files created in other print master programs for editing.  Had I known that, I would not have wasted my time, energy, or funds for this product.  If you are new to print master maybe you will find it a good investment, however if your not, don't waste your money.  Shame on you Encore Software for not following through with a format that PrintMaster users are used to."
2,"The layout and functions are very similar to Office 2010.  However, Microsoft has eliminated most of the trademark colors in the user interface, making it a little stark.  Personally, I think Microsoft did a great job with Office 2003 and has been going downhill with the \\""ribbons\\"".  One nice improvement with 2013 over 2010 is the integration with SkyDrive.  If you need Word, Excel and Outlook, and are moving from 2010, don't be afraid by the reviews.  Just don't expect much more than a functional program.  If you are moving from 2003 or 2007, then you may want to wait because the new menus in 2010 and 2013 will frustrate you.<br /><br />FYI, I'm using on Windows 7 Pro 64-bit.<br /><br />BTW, if you hate the menus, a company called Addintools sells a product called Classic Menu.  It gives you the choice to use the classic 2003 menu system or the new \\""ribbon\\"" 2010/2013 menus.  Just an option.  The product is great for 2007 and 2010, but 2013 is really ugly."
2,Great product
4,"World-class application, per the usual for Adobe. Some of the new features are wicked fast and continues to make me excited to be a creative.<br /><br />It looks like most of the people on this string just hate the change of plans, or haven't purchased this at all. Frankly, I'm a millennial and I think purchasing software like this is far more convenient for me and my finances, rather than having to commit to a piece of (traditional) software that becomes outdated the moment you make the purchase.<br /><br />If you are a super casual hobbyist, this might not be for you; but if your craft relies on having powerful tools with which you can communicate with your peers, there's no more cost-effective option."
1,"I have to say I'm really disappointed with this program. Like many others, I used Quicken for years. Being able to reconcile as you go, instead of waiting for monthly statements, was a real plus. iBank does not support that. And the program just isn't smart and intuitive. I am constantly having to edit and delete duplicate transactions - seriously, I have the date, amount and payee all correct and iBank still adds it as a new transaction. Not just occasionally but ALWAYS. I was not able to make sense of the budgeting function. All I want there is a simple envelope system - let me budget a list of regular monthly transactions and against 5 or 6 variable buckets like groceries, gas, etc. Then assign categories to those buckets so I can run daily reports. Or better yet, know exactly where I stand when I'm in the checkout line at the grocery store. In the end, I only use the program to record transactions, painfully clean them up and categorize them, and run reports for my accountant."
1,"I really hate giving bad reviews. The good part is that for most folks, this software will probably do OK. Adding envelopes points to modify the tracks is extremely non-productive. In order to add volume points I have to play the video and adjust the volume in real time first. Why not just give me an option to add an envelope and add points by right clicking? Did I miss something?<br /><br />The rendering was a bit slower than Sony Platinum Studio 12, but wasn't bad.<br /><br />Synchronizing audio was almost too troublesome to use. I could never get it to synch right. The UI is just not intuitive to me. I know there are a lot of folks who find it easy to use, but anyone who has used a professional editing system will find it extremely awkward and unorthodox."
4,We recently renewed our PC Matic for year 2. Love the product. Have had no issues with our computer. Would recommend this to friends and family.
1,Can't backup my files have had support say error is nothing to worry about still won't let me do it<br />.<br /><br />.
0,"I have used their software for more than 10 years. It worked well till this year. In 2013 I purchased a Ford C-MAX car. This is one of the one that gets the tax credit for being a Plug-in Hybrid car. The problem is that after I spent a day and a half working through all the H&R Block question / answer stuff to do my return, I found it never let me say I have a car that gets the credit. I found the form needed on the IRS web site (# 8936) but there is no way to include it in my return with this software. I contacted their online chat help (after a 30+ minute wait ... it is the tax season), and they confirmed that this software cannot do my return.<br /><br />Note Amazon says there is no refund for this software, so be careful. If you don't need this feature you may still like it, but hope there is nothing else you need that they don't support.<br /><br />I am just very frustrated at all the work I put into doing this return only to find I need to start over with the competing product. That time cost me a lot more than the software purchase price.  :-("
2,"Very basic stuff, indeed it allows to buid a music piece but lacks the posibility of easily combining or changing preset riffs, like garage band for example, it is ok but not great"
0,"Because Microsoft Money is out of date, there is no other product than this.  Too many advertisements when you use the program.  Multiple updates that will delete all your archived files forcing you to start all over agsin EVERY year.  If I were better at excel I would create my own checkbook.  Terrible program to use compaired to my experience with Microsoft Money.  If Microsoft ever updates Quicken will be dumped in the trash immediately."

When you click on flashcard, the English translation is given, and you have the option of hearing the Thai pronunciation.<br /><br />There are two aspects of this program that I didn't like. First, the vocabulary selection is terrible. Too much of it is tourist specific. Even if you were using the course to prepare for a trip to Bangkok, you don't need to know the Thai words for &#34;duty free,&#34; &#34;hangar&#34; and &#34;boarding gate&#34; to travel around the country. And that type of vocabulary is worthless for a beginning or intermediate student. What percentage of your daily conversations involve airplane hangars or duty free shops? In short, there aren't enough useful verbs in this program. Second, the flashcards always appear in the same order. So, for example,  if you're studying colors, you will know after you've been through the cards a couple times that green comes after blue, even if you don't actually recognize the Thai word for green.<br /><br />But, having aired my complaints, I wish I had had a program like this 20 years ago when I was studying Russian, or 25 years ago when I was studying French. Studying Thai vocabulary without audio is almost pointless. So this program provides an inexpensive way to practice reading and pronouncing Thai while building your vocabulary."
1,Every year's version gets more difficult to install.  This version has problems with activating - error messages  that it can't connect to Norton server.  No response from Norton support when I sent an email
3,"I was very impressed at how I was able to upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 8 with PCMover and kept all my files and programmes. Until then everywhere else, including Microsoft!! I was reading that to upgrade to Windows 8 from XP I would have to lose my files and programmes and have installation files/disks for all my programmes to reinstall. PCMover helped me with the updgrade. I am very pleased!"
3,"The Norton Internet Security is money well spent, it make sure that your facebook wall and statuses dont threat your computer and it scans your whole facebook which I love. However, the one thing that I wish it would do is to notify you that the link that you click into is or isn't a spam website. You still have to be really cautious about what website you go to, but other than that it is worth the money, that was my only concern, but it really does protect you. One of the awesome features have the vault and the login assistant where you save your passwords from any site and how you access the vault you have to log on and once you do that your passwords pop up on the correct password box. The only problem with that is it keeps saying that your password does not exist and you have to constantly create a new password just to access to your passwords and if you do create a new password they automatically delete your password info. Which is irritating so I don't use that feature. But the up side to this product is that when you search for something on Google or whatever search engine, before you click on a web link it would say beside it Norton safe web \\""ok\\"" which means that that particular site is safe to go on. The thing is you really need to look before you click on a site. Other than that no problems with the product its safe and the money you pay for this product is money well spent. I totally recommand this product and you only pay for this product once a year which is a good deal. I recommand you guys buying this product only at Amazon verses buying this from the actual Norton website because its cheaper and you are getting a good deal."
3,DOWNLOAD ALWAY TRICKY WITH NORTON. PREFER USING A CD.
4,"I'm one of many former TurboTax Deluxe users who chose not to be fleeced by Intuit dumbing down their software to force customers to spend $30 extra to get the same functionality as last year.  The H&R Block Deluxe software downloaded and installed correctly on my Windows 7 PC in just a matter of minutes.  It then correctly transferred my data from my 2013 TurboTax file.<br /><br />It seems the majority of the 1 star reviews for this product are from people still using Windows XP.  Might be time to upgrade, folks.  Even Microsoft no longer supports XP, and it's their product!"
0,It sucks
3,Easy to install. The data copy was seemless. Still working on the best uses. I have only had it a month.
2,"As previously noted by aviationFan, the key code you need to e-file can be found at<br />Amazon > Your Account > Your Games & Software Library, H&R Block should be there with the Product Key: ####### at the bottom.<br /><br />The program is fairly good, it got the job done.<br />I've had headaches with tax people doing poor work, at least this way I can only blame myself."
4,I use it every year. I am very comfortable with using this program.
4,Love turbo Tax and amazon makes it easy to get it.
3,"So far so good. I know new quicken versions can be prone to problems, but this one seems pretty polished. The ONLY problem that I had was it duplicated some transactions during the initial download. After looking up this issue on their site, I saw that this sometimes happens. I just sorted my transactions by dollar amount and removed the dups...took about 20 minutes and was a bit of a pain, but no problems since then.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Been working great since I downloaded the latest update.  While not perfect, still the best option out there in my opinion."
0,Crashes frequently
1,"I resent the fact I was forced by Quicken to purchase this product. I was using Quicken Premier 2010 version.  About three months ago I was getting \\""nag\\"" popup screens, informing me I would need the newer 2013 version because after April 2013 I would no longer be able to use all of it's features, such as syncing with my bank and other financial providers I use.  I have been using Quicken since they came out many years ago.  I think it was Version 2, as they called it at that time. I was always buying updates after two to three years to get the new features.....BUT THIS WAS MY CHOICE! I seldom give bad reviews.  I am waiting for the next \\""shoe to fall\\"" after a year or two.  I also noted the price keeps going up and the features of the versions gets less and less, forcing me to go to a more expensive version.  Sheesh, I now need the Premier version just to record Capital Gains and Loses."
0,Unable to download on a new Dell computer.
0,"This is my 2nd review after upgrading to 2014 from 2013 (which was great by the way).<br /><br />Not only does the program continuously get S-L-O-W-E-R as you use it, but I now noticed that the keyboard shortcuts do not work as well. I use CTRL-C,V & X often, and it worked fine in 2013, but does not work at all now, along with other keyboard shortcuts.<br /><br />As for the slowness, the best way I can describe it is with an analogy of making a thick gravy. It's nice and thin (fast) when you start, but as you add more flour (open windows and click round the program), it gets thicker and thicker (slower and slower).<br /><br />I have spend hours with chat support, have tried everything and FINALLY someone admitted that they had problems and it would be fixed in the next release.<br /><br />So... Release 5 just came out, and there has been no change whatsoever. My recommendation:<br /><br />DO NOT UPGRADE UNTIL THESE BUGS ARE FIXED!"
1,Unable to assist with my situation (foreign earned income) and not sure I will order this product again. I wish I had not ordered
0,"You offer this for free, then discontinue the free price and want to charge me?  Glad that I didn't trust Amazon in the first place.  Google Drive offers much more space for free and so far, you can trust Google."
0,Not for windows7
0,"Amazon bated me into this purchase with an e-mail promising a discount for Prime Members. Then Charged full price! Then sent me a credit for the future purchase of a product I never intend on buying. When it came to download the product (Turbo Tax) it is listed as a 114 MB download. I click to begin the download, it downloads a 1.0 MB program and gives me the &#34;Download Complete&#34; message (which I know can't be true) in less than .05 seconds. Now it expects me to run another program to get my TurboTax product. At this point, I so distrust the process due to the misleading statements, I'm not sure I want to run this other program not knowing where it may lead me next or what will be introduced into my computer in the process. I was a very happy 2 Year Prime Member before tonight."
4,"Love the product and Amazon had a great price for the product.  The software is very easy to use, comes with state and fed e-file."
0,"If the software worked like it should, I would likely be happy with it, but I can't trust a product that randomly misses putting downloaded transactions in your register. I have worked with &#34;support&#34; multiple times for multiple hours. We can get it to work by totally deleting the account and re-adding it, but then I have to setup everything again and it only works for a few days. Not what I signed up for.<br /><br />Even better, while working with their support (which they claim is Chat only), if you have to wait on them to respond for more than 5 minutes you will get disconnected. It assumes you abandoned the chat because you haven't typed anything in 5 minutes. then you get to start all over (which is where I'm at right now).<br /><br />I have been dealing with this for well over a month. I really want to get it to work because I really like being able to forecast balances based off upcoming bills and I can't find anything else that does this."
2,"it works, it is easy. you get favorable tax reviews (imo). however, turbotax is so scammy with all the weird bundles, fees, versions, etc. you never know exactly what you are going to pay until your taxes are filed. otherwise a great product."
0,If this trial version is like the full version then I would tell you stay away. I had this installed on a laptop with Windows 7. It installed fine but has crashed three out of the four times I have used it. My wife has used an older version in the past and she spoke that crashing was a common issue for that version as well. All I can say is that I am glad I did not buy the full version even on sale.
3,"Cheapest price I could find online.  Works well. As a long time Office user I could never get used to Apple's offerings, i.e. pages, numbers, keynote... Downloadable version was a easy as pie!"
2,"Hmmm I feel that since installing this software, I could have the best result in the process of creating PDF document. Is freezing"
0,"I used H&R Block at Home last year without any complaints, but this year, it's been a nightmare.<br /><br />There is a bug in the software which requires you to enter a date in a field on the capital gains and losses worksheet, but when filling out the actual tax forms, the word &#34;various&#34; is perfectly acceptable. Not according to this software, it _only_ accepts a date.<br /><br />I called H&R Block tech support, waiting on hold for 30 minutes before they finally connected me with a human. The person I spoke to was friendly, but her supervisor refused to acknowledge this as a bug in the program and instead told me I had to use my one free tax advice email to get this resolved. I don't see this as a tax advice issue, but fine, whatever. So I used the &#34;Email a tax professional&#34; feature. Tried to, rather. As I was typing my question, it cleared the form fields TWICE, erasing my question and forcing me to start all over.<br /><br />Yeah, sorry, third time is not a charm. Since H&R Block can't even get the forms right, I've lost countless hours of work and have to start over from scratch with another program or website."
4,Far ahead of any other anti-virus. Thank You Avast for being the best. Would take it two to one over any other
3,"The screen capture function is wonderful. That said, I use a second program to convert the videos to a HD video or standard video size and then a third program to actually edit the videos.<br /><br />The editing portion of the Screen Capture isn't intuitive, and support for that portion of the program is lacking for that function of the program. But that said, I didn't buy Screen Capture to edit videos -- I bought it to capture streaming video."
3,"I had few hiccups at the time of purchase. Amazon couldn't generate the map code immediately. I got a confirmation email after 30 minutes.     Activation was quite simple because I already had an account on Garmin with my GPS registered to it. The download + installation took about 2 hours. I had the time and patience to wait it out...so, no big deal. My Garmin account listed the Map download expiry to be one year from my date of activation. I was expecting it to have no expiry date. I had to submit a ticket with Garmin to clarify this. Here is the update from them:  \\""The lifetime map update subscription simply allows you access to each quarterly map update that is released however each update will have an expiration date. The subscription doesn't expire but each update released does. \\"". So, if you see ever see an expiry date for your lifetime map update on your Garmin account, no need to panic!"
3,Works and no big performance hit.
1,Does not import as well as the old version; no improvement and unstable.
1,"I love this program and it is the best calendar program I've used, even better than outlook.  Unfortunately...if you have a problem you will not get a response from their support.  I can not get it to sync with outlook and have sent several emails with no response."
2,"I was using Quicken 2010, and very happy with it. I have been a Quicken user since the early 90s, and I don't upgrade every year just because there is a new version, it has to have something worth upgrading for. This version DOES NOT have that. Intuit just wanted my money, so they forced 2010 users to switch because they stop supporting 2010, and turned off the financial institutions downloads. I would have switched to another program, but there are no longer any good ones out there, and Intuit knows this, so they can force you to upgrade with no repercussions.<br /><br />Quicken 2013 overall is a descent program. It has a similar interface to 2010, just upgraded with a new look. I have not had any issues with my financial institutions updating data, but there are no major upgrades from 2010. I ding Intuit 2 stars for forcing me to stop using a program a I liked and was comfortable with."
0,I purchased this product and attempted to download it.  The download process would not work.  I actually phoned MS and their helpful customer service staff informed me the product key would be an obvious part of this package.............I could not locate a product key anywhere.<br /><br />Worst product I have ever purchased through Amazon.  Additionally - this is not a great money saver.  I just purchased Office at an Office Depot and although it is good for just 4 years; vs. the life of the computer; it was $87.39.................and it comes with a product key code.  Note: this is not the first I have heard about a product key code; I was simply under the impression this download from Amazon would provide one.<br /><br />I could not easily obtain support from Amazon and as a Masters-level student; I cannot sacrifice the time waiting.
1,"I use Quicken to track my finances because I absolutely don't feel comfortable with having my financial information stored on computers I don't control (if I did, I'd use Mint instead of Quicken). I've been using Quicken 2013 for the past couple of years. It had a couple of quirks, but it worked decently well and I didn't really have a reason to upgrade to 2014. I recently added a few new accounts that weren't auto-updating, so I figured it'd be a good time to upgrade and see if they would with 2015.  Right off the bat, as soon as I installed, I was forced to sign in with an online ID--you can't use Quicken 2015 without signing in online. This immediately gave me pause; since I didn't want my information stored on their servers, why is an online ID necessary? After about 10 minutes of considering what to do, I decided to sniff the network traffic coming off of my computer and forge ahead, making sure that nothing I didn't want to went off of my machine.  I already use TurboTax (a product I like a lot), so I already had an ID I could use. But just signing in wasn't enough--I was also forced to enter my name and address and say where I purchased Quicken. Then an option came up about syncing with my phone, which I obviously didn't want to do, so I opted out, though I would have preferred it to be opt-in instead of opt-out. There were another couple of screens prompting me to convert my local password database into something encrypted with my online ID instead, which I again had to opt out of. I hadn't even started using it yet, but I was already rather frustrated with how difficult and intrusive what I thought was going to be a quick upgrade turned out to be.  Once I did finally get into Quicken itself, I found that the program was unbelievably full of bugs. The most frustrating one is that the window has a problem painting itself (it basically goes blank) if I expand the width to be wider than 1920 pixels. My main monitor is 3840x2160, so I can only use it snapped tohalf the screen. Quicken 2013 handled being full screen at high resolution just fine. Trying to shove all the columns I'm used to into half the screen space means that I either have to scroll to see everything or shrink the columns so that I can't see as much info as I want per column. Huge regression in usability.  There are lots of other glitches too--often, the column titles are smaller than the width of the data columns, so they're not lined up until I click on them to try to resize. The most severe thing I've found is that if I'm in an investment account, and I click the &#34;Tools&#34; menu, Quicken crashes. 100% reproducible.  After looking at the HTTP requests it was making, I'm satisfied that all my information is being stored only locally. Each time I update my accounts, I see requests going out to all of my banks and data coming back directly from them, which is exactly what I want. Annoyingly, upgrading didn't fix the auto-update on the accounts that weren't updating (but I haven't played around with it too much yet or tried to reconfigure it since upgrading).  Overall, I hated the upgrade process, and I hate the direction that Quicken is heading. Intuit owns both Quicken and Mint, so why does it seem to feel the need to make Quicken the same thing as Mint? I'm sure there's a market for people who don't want their aggregated financial information stored online, yet still want to have automatic import of data from banks. But, for me the big thing isn't the one-time upgrade process but the product you're left with after that you'll use on a regular basis. It does technically work, but the serious bugs I've seen are a huge step backward. I figured that waiting for several months after the initial release would mean I'd get pretty stable software, but that's definitely not the case. I'll keep using it for now, but I'm really tempted to go back to the stable Quicken 2013."
4,It was an easy download from Amazon and the product is doing the exact job I need it to do for getting college projects done. I can see the improvements over the 2010 product that I had been using. I really like it.
0,"I purchased Punch's Landscape Deck & Patio and as soon as it was finished installing, which took forever on my brand new Asus desktop which has everything required for installation, I was given an error message. Jason Carver I called the only number I could find on Punch's website and was referred by the automated system to look into your forums. What a load of CRAP!!! I had already tried to fix the issue using your forums which are no help at all and now I need to talk to a PERSON! Punch doesn't even offer that. Tomorrow I will be returning this worthless product back to Best Buy where I purchased it a few days ago. Jason your forum can only go so far and it speaks volumes about Punch's customer support that you cannot even talk to a live person."
0,I cant print anything after the install. I lost some other features also that I use....or used to use....daily. I will probably revert my computer and get something else which means I wasted my money on this.
2,"I like the software and it does work well. What I do not like is that only 3 weeks after I purchased this, Toast 14 was released. And only paid upgrades were available. I had also purchased the HD plugin, which cost another $20 and the upgrade for the plugin is another $20!"
2,But not compatible with Windows 8
2,downloaded this and could not use it it might be free but the problem is that when you want to clean out your machine the program tells you that you have to buy the program for 29.99
1,"I'm using TurboTax for the first time. So far it seems like a straight forward interface, but the pricing structure really turns me off. I read all the product reviews that warned about the pricing gimmicks when e-filing state taxes, and was prepared for the $20 e-filing fee or using the print/snail mail option. However, no warning about the extra $40 charge for downloading a second state!! That's like buying this product twice. If you've earned income in more than one state, or like me, are a student and maintain residency in another state, be warned!"
3,"Obviously it's a very useful tool, it has some minor bugs, but nothing that can't be overcome.  Tech support was helpful, though it took more time then I would have expected.  The only questionable &#34;feature&#34; I have encountered, is that it forces you to use transfer categories, to the point that if you change the category, it disappears from the transfer account.  This didn't exist in previous versions, and I am still not 100% sure how many transactions I may have lost due to this (I went back to the earliest back-up I could find, but the balances still don't add up 100%)."
0,"This was marketed as a contact management software, but when you buy it, you have to subscribe to monthly fee services.  I can't even go in and add contacts individually.  Don't buy this product.  It is a scam.  and you can't get a refund."
2,"I have used Microsoft Office, in particular Microsoft Word since it first came out. My old computer did what old computers do, it died. I had Office 2007 on that computer and I very much liked it.<br /><br />I bought a new laptop which came with Windows 8 and then I bought Office Home and Student 2013. This program works properly only if you are on-line, logged into your Microsoft account and have a fast internet connection. I live in a rural area, have a S L O W internet connection and do most of my work off-line and at times I feel as though I am working with half a program. It may be a great program on a high end, touch screen always on-line machine but on a non-touch, ordinary, everyday, affordable laptop it just is not what I expected from Microsoft.<br /><br />A part of the older versions of Office that I used a great deal was the Microsoft Office Picture Manager. Microsoft has removed Picture Manager from the 2013 edition of Office and older versions of Picture Manager will not run in Office 2013.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I wish I had bought Office 2010 and NOT 2013. I am not an IT professional but I am also not computer illiterate and this program is driving me up the wall.<br /><br />UPDATE to This Review:<br /><br />Two days ago I had the chance to try out Office 2013 on a high end PC with a touch screen that was running Windows 8.1 and was connected to the Internet via a high speed broadband cable. The difference between the high end system and my old style, no touch screen, slow internet connection (if any)running Windows 8.0 and the new state-of-the-art system was very noticeable, Word 2013 in particular was almost a different product, one I would have no problem getting used to.<br /><br />So I have raised my rating of Office 2013 from 1 Star to 3 Stars--provided you have a high end PC with a touch screen or one of the high end tablets with a lot of memory and a keyboard and a very good internet connection."
0,"I have been a conistent used of Turbotax, but this year wanted to try its competition, additional motivation being the ridiculous prices for Turbotax software.  However the H&R Block software falls way short of my expectation.  Its interview process is rather lights, help along the way is rather bad as well.<br /><br />I can't come to terms in regards to paying such high prices for TurboTax, but H&R Block isn't helping itself get me as a customer with the quality seen in this software."
4,We have been using TurboTax or the last seven years. We used to have a tax accountant who increased their fee every year. I finally stopped using them once they handing me a bill for $1100. I have been very satisfied with this program year after year.
1,I got HR block because of the Turbo Tax issue.<br /><br />I am disappointed with HR Block for 2 reasons<br /><br />1)An extra state tax return was very very expensive. It cost me with tax $41 for New York.  I don't remember it being this much when I used Turbo tax.<br /><br />2) HR Block double my NJ reported income.  There is no reason for it to do this.  I had to override the this line.
4,Works great.
1,"You can't even do a general internet search without having items blocked continuously. The things u want to allow are blocked and other junk gets by. Our office computer whiz has tried different settings, but it that has not helped much.  Don't know what to do."
3,I like this Anti Virus. Been using it for a number of years and it has caught all<br />of my bad site decisions.<br />Wish it had a bit more online market features
1,"I ordered Quicken 2015 for Mac with high hopes.  When compared to Quicken Essentials for Mac there are several differences that I cannot get past with this new version:<br /><br />1)  Font appearances - program looks like an early draft version of what it should be.  Finance summary should contained bolded heading amounts and fonts sized differently from individual account amounts.  These fonts look like they were still in test mode and never updated.<br /><br />2)  While the check register has larger fonts which is nice, the color separation from one line to next is so slight its almost looks as if there is no color separation at all between lines.  Additionally, there are no vertical lines separating each input field making it look as though you have to guess where to click.<br /><br />3)  This new version takes noticeably longer to launch than Essentials does making it a deal breaker right now.  How is this an improvement?<br /><br />If Quicken can improve these features, it may be a worthwhile upgrade.  Features like bill pay & historical net worth should be mandatory inclusions in this software and should NOT be part of the &#34;voted&#34; options.  It is supposed to be financial software after all.<br /><br />In the end, the software looks only half-baked at the moment.  I would recommend holding off upgrading until Intuit make some of the improvements they are talking about.  Right now you can save some money with Essentials."
4,Excellent
3,I have been using Quicken for over 15 years.  It's almost a necessity to upgrade periodically.  My last upgrade was in 2005 and this worked great.
0,"Of the large tech companies, Nuance has one of the worst customer services known.  The core, excellent product was basically ripped off from a Cambridge husband & wife team decades ago & has become a perpetual marketing vehicle ever since.  It has the same abysmal lack of attention to detail and consumer indifference that Microsoft has made infamous.  Every new version is &#34;25%&#34; faster than the one before, until you look at the real numbers, which are second decimal place-sized improvements.  Schlock management; fundamentally a good product with many operational flaws that never get fixed as they have no competition."
3,Did what I needed it to do - provided antivirus protection at a good price
1,I have been a turbo tax user for 20 years. Last year was the best and this year was the worst ever. There was so many errors and<br />the interview was usually wrong! I ended up going page to page and entering everything. I could have done it faster without Turbo!<br /> I never did find the home deductions.
2,"I recently did an update to my 2004 version.  I don't use a lot of the features.  Mostly just to track my checking and savings accounts.  I had a terrible time getting my scheduled list straightened out once I updated to the 2014 version.  I preferred having the scheduled list the old way.  It was much easier to understand.  I've only had it about a month.  Maybe I'll change my mind, but I doubt it."
0,Would not download!
3,As good as turbo tax but cheaper. Have been using toubo tax since day one.  Tried H&R this year because of the price.

0,"Someone needs to sue the pants off these companies for false advertising.  You are not buying the software per se, you are buying a one year license.  After a year the product will not work AT ALL.  You will have to buy another license after that if you want the software to work."
2,I have no complicated tax issues so this product was fine. What I DID NOT LIKE was how sneaky it is about state e-file. It's an additional $19.99 it is not free. That needs to be made explicitly clear on the item details and it is NOT.
4,This is an amazing product that amazon has come out with . I recommend it to all. I love it and will continue to use mine . It is the best product yet since they made available the kindle app

3,"Typical Adobe. Works exactly as expected. This is a great, inexpensive way to have some of the photoshop features in an easy to use format.  Three levels for skill are appreciated."
1,To simplified  with briefer info and no one such as BOA compatible  yet.  Not worth the cost my laptop  windows acct program can do this
4,"I have being using TurboTax since 2009, I like the simplicity of filing your taxes, very user friendly and how accurate it is. Have used it every year and never had a problem with the IRS."
4,Imported all our info with no issues. My wife had no problem using it the first time with the new interface on Win 8.1. Easy install
1,Complicated to install software. Too many installation &#34;gates&#34; with amazon purchase.<br /> with
3,"Worked great although I was annoyed that it activated like a different product than my previous norton internet security 2013 rather than adding to the remaining days -meaning that I should have waited to click the &#34;renew my subscription&#34; button until my previous subscription was up -e.g. it didn't add my remaining 44 days to this 365 day subscription.  After much searching for a proper solution to this issue on their site I gave up out of frustration.  Otherwise, the year subscription worked great -good product at a good price."
1,This program would not let me save a copy of my tax return in my computer as word file or as a pdf file.
0,I thought it moved too slowly and it is clearly for young children.  I like the original games the best.
2,"I initially had a problem because the application does not seem to fully support the latest PSD files and crashes when trying to open them or preview them. I do like that most of the EDIT interface is similar to my old PSP8 that I love so much but has additional new features and runs better on Windows 7.   If you have issues with the application crashing, look to see if the initial preview directory has PSD files present and move them. I hope they fix this issue. If they fix it then I will upgrade this review to 5 stars."
2,"Problems with license and activation codes, after 8 months of use it started.  Had to contact support for a new update installation."
2,It is MUCH slower than my previous versions and they changed the Budget dramatically such that I do NOT like that at all.
1,I've been using &#34;Deluxe&#34; for many years and this was the first time Intuit made me upgrade mid-way through the filing process to &#34;Premier&#34; for $30 more because I had a K-1.  Shame on you Intuit!!!!!!!  Shame on you!!!!!
0,This product only imports from PDF files and when importing it does not import accurately.  You will need to review and clean up the imported information.  I am trying to cancel the order as I type.
3,Savings on the educational price is well worth the trouble in getting approved by Adobe.  Need specific documentation and the process could be explained a little better.
3,"Easy to use software, idea for editing photos.  Easy for someone like me inexperienced in editing.  Meets all my expectations."
0,I could not get the scrolling to work on my computer.  Apparently alot of people can't.  I'll go back to V10.
4,Ive used Avast for years and it has served me well. Hasnt let a virus slip passed yet. Thanks Avast
3,"This software does what I need it to do, nothing fancy.  I like to keep track of my accounts and how much money I have in them, this software allows me to do that.  I used to have an older version of Quicken and then changed computers so I needed/wanted an upgrade, I decided to get this edition and it is good to Organize your money."
4,User friendly
3,"I've been using Norton security products since the late 80's, and never been disappointed. Good, solid package, and Amazon digital download makes it a great value."
3,"Although it is not always perfect, rather expensive it works and I use it yearly."
3,I had been told that I could convert my QB data into Quicken data.  But because my QB software had died I found I couldn't do anything with it.  To accomplish the conversion you would have to have QB to work with the data to begin with.  So I will be using date from 2 different records at tax time.<br /><br />At first I was afraid I wasted my money on Quicken but now I am finding that solutions and explanations are generally pretty easy and straightforward - once its explained to me.  I hired a coach to learn and that has been very valuable!  About 3 sessions and I about have it - the basics anyway.  I'm getting familiar with it.  Had it about a month.
0,"Have Quicken 2007 on an older PC and was hoping to migrate over to IBank on an Apple computer. This product has minimal functionality and was clearly a waste of dollars; transactional memorizing worthless, locks up, etc........."
1,"I'd give perhaps the lesser rating but actually I avoided TurboTax this year after using it for several years and otherwise entirely happy with their product...until I read of their changes this year and trying to step back and try to make amends. I wrote them with their form letter response to say, &#34;Too little, too late. I've opted to H&R instead this year&#34;.<br /><br />Whoever made the poor decisions at Intuit ought to be fired. A fine product and they got piggy.<br /><br />The alternate I mentioned, well, has some good things about it, but I still preferred the format old TurboTax used to have. The only thing I can state otherwise is that this alternate product brought attention to me of a real estate tax credit for seniors in MO I was never made aware of with TurboTax in the past...and this literally saved my 86 year old mother on a fixed income with a $1100 real estate tax rebate off her state taxes. Not that I love this other product, I just wish TurboTax kept up with what was a winning product, improved upon it to justify additional cost, rather than fall flat on their face with such inept decisions at whatever level that deserves the criticism."
0,Cannot use the product due to the website being down. I wasted my money. BUYER BEWARE! I want my money back from Amazon!
3,Used the older version for years and was very satisfied.  This version has the same features but with an updated and more modern look.
2,"I had a lot of trouble this year with my Turbotax.  It keep saying there were form that were necessary that were not available yet.  Even up to March 15 and I downloaded it again (they claimed I would be emailed when forms were available & I never was).<br />Now, they claim everything has been emailed, but I have yet to receive confirmation from IRS.  I'm unhappy with them this year."
1,I found this software to be unnecessarily complicated to use and limited in editing functions.  I am so frustrated with it that I would rather just draw a basic line drawing of my house design on powerpoint.
1,No comparison to ms office
2,"First, the trial version that Amazon sells for $29.00 is available for FREE from the manufacturer's website, and the full version is $29.00 from the manufacturer's website, so buy it there. The difference has already been mentioned, the trial version only allows downloading from YouTube, but unlike the other free YouTube downloaders out there, this trial version will also allow you to convert the video file into any other video format for viewing on a mobile device. However, during the conversion process, the company's logo is left in the center of the video as a watermark. If you don't mind this and don't want the full version, then go ahead and buy the Amazon version, or get it for free from the manufacturer's website, your choice. The full version allows downloading from Hulu, Vevo, and about a dozen other sites listed on the product's webpage."
4,Good internet security for the cost.
1,Good product but be aware you need to pay extra to send in the state tax. That is not at all clear in the info about the product. Adds another $25 to the cost. Going with TaxAct this time.
0,I want my money back. The reporting is terrible in comparison to Quicken for windows. I can't link transactions. I can't match transactions. I can't get a calendar projected balance to see if I may go overdraft at any point. I can keep on going...To keep track of transactions...my bank does that for me and so does my credit card companies.
4,While doing computer upgrades we discovered that we had lost our original disc.  All the data was still there but we could not access it on the new PC without the program disc.  We just downloaded it and went to work again. Simple and easy!
3,For the price this gives you a lot of bang for the buck.  I wish there were a few more cook books on the product for Quick Starts
1,"This package was purchased at a discount as part of a special deal for purchasing TurboTax (which I really liked). I have not been impressed with Quicken in the past but thought that for the price it was worth trying one more time. My impressions were the same as in the past. It did not have the capability to import the majority of my accounts and it wasn't worth the large effort to do it manually.  My benchmark for this function is an Excell spreadsheet which is faster and easier to import data into and has much more flexibility.  When I have more time, I will try Quicken again and update this review if necessary. In the meantime I will continue to use my spreadsheet to monitor my accounts."
3,"Downloading tax software is quick and easy.  Only issue is when your computer get hit by a \\""virus\\"" and you cannot get a back-up download. Soughta put one in a bind."
4,Product has good functionality and flexibility for environments that do not fit neatly into pre-designed templates. User friendly - although what has actually been improved by changes is not always clear and sometimes causes minor use issues.  Overall an excellent product for accounting and financial management.
2,"After many years using PC's I changed to a Mac and  had to go with Quicken Essentials. I do not find it as easy to use as my old versions of  Quicken for PC software that I had used for about 15 years. For example when entering a paid out transaction amount in the PC Quicken the prior amount paid would appear and and you could just enter the new amount. With Quicken Essentials you have to delete the prior amount or it remains and the new amount is added to it and an incorrect figure is subtracted.  When entering a new transaction in Quicken PC, the current date would automatically appear but in Essentals the date of the last transaction reconciled appears and I have to delete it and enter the current date. This has to be done with EVERY transaction. Maybe I am missing something? Pleased with with the new Mac but can't say the same about the Quicken Essentials."
1,Returned
2,"Whether you love this version of Quicken for Mac or hate it will depend on how you intend to use it, as there are some real improvements with this new version, though it is missing several features that some Quicken users have grown to depend on.<br /><br />I have nearly 20 years of data in Quicken for Mac, but when Intuit stopped supporting my Quicken 2006, I found Quicken Essentials not up to the task (no support for investments)--and I was insulted that Quicken wanted to charge me money for Q2007.  So I tried iBank, but I never understood it.<br /><br />Now that Quicken for Mac 2015 supports tracking of investments, I am back.  And it's a bit of a love-hate relationship.<br /><br />--I love the new interface and the drag-and-drop functionality (import transactions into the wrong account?  Just drag it to the right account).<br />--I love the ability to enter investment transactions and (at long last) sync my investments with my company 401k plan.<br />--I love that this version seems to grab my on-line data much more easily than Q2006 (or iBank) did.<br /><br />--I hate the lack of reports, particularly with regard to investments (ROI, etc).<br />--I hate the lack of a loan amortization feature (so now I have to enter the principal and interest from my bank's amortization table).<br />--I hate the lack of budget options (it takes a look at my last three months and spits out a plan--which, granted,  I can tweak--but why not a 12-month budget?  Why not the ability to budget for every two weeks, or by quarter?)<br />--I hate the \\""default\\"" rename all button--more than once I have overwritten a whole history of payments to a payee when I just wanted to change one transaction.<br /><br />I use my bank for bill paying (it's free), so I personally don't care about the lack of bill pay.  But others can't live without it.<br /><br />But mostly, I love that Quicken once again (finally!) has real budgeting software for the Mac--and holds out the promise of future features (though I hate that they have broken their faith with me in the past).tures (though I hate that they have broken their faith with me in the past)."
0,No needed to reinstall it and could not money wasted
2,This has been my tax software for many years.  I like it better than other products of this nature that I have tried.  The biggest problem I have had with it is that in resent years it didn't fill out my direct deposit request on my state tax forms.  Because of that for 2 years I got a debit card from the state foisted on me.
2,I have used 2004 for several years and I have returned to it. 2015 Quickens was not what I needed
4,Have used Turbo Tax for over 10 years now and it has done the job excellently
4,"Best antivirus I've ever had.<br />Interface is slick, doesn't bog down my machine and I believe buying the pro version has been more than worth it.<br />If you're looking for an effective and easy to use antivirus with browsing shields and the like, look no further."
4,I had the x2 version of this and I am delighted with all the fantastic updates that have been made to it.  I definitely recommend it.
4,"I've been using H&R Block's software for years and it does a very good job of walking you through the task of filing taxes.  You still need to get all your information together and have a basic understanding of how to work through your taxes, but $40 is better than $400 to have someone else do it for you."
2,"While it has a lot of features, they are very confusing and not easily figured out.  For example, the budget function does not work as I would expect.  I also purchased this for my daughter and she uses the automatic update from her bank (I enter manually), when she does it enters the transactions twice which is very confusing to her, so she is not able to utilize it as she would like."
4,I WOULD RECOMMEND AVAST TO ANYONE!!! I have been using the free antivirus for about 4 years now and it has really done the job.
4,The product was what I ordered.  The purchase was electronic woth no problems to the software.  Had no problems loading to the computer
2,I am a satisfied Quicken user for 12 years. I upgraded to Quicken 2013 because my Quicken 2010 version will no longer be supported after April 2013.  I use the program strictly to track investments.  The Quicken 2013 does little more than the previous version did for me.  I might try to use the program with a mobile device in the future.
1,"I had Quicken 2011 and wasn't planing to purchase any newer product from Quicken. When they informed me that 2011 would no longer be supported, I thought I should try and upgrade to 2014. When I loaded it, I noticed it looks exactly like 2011 Premier and that truly, nothing has changed. The mobile syncing is terrible, so I don't even believe I'm going to use this feature. It's exactly like the free app of &#34;mint&#34; and is much more difficult to use than mint. I don't know how quicken got this so wrong. I'm truly upset that I wasted so much money on this and I will get no use out of it at all."
1,I cannot believe they have not applied ability to place transactions for automatic payment from list of payees.
3,"I have an Acer Aspire One D255E netbook upon which I must run Windows in order to use a Windows only software package-specifically the well known Ross-Tech VCDS diagnostic program for VW/Audi vehicles.  I was using Linux on this netbook with few issues, but it's difficult to impossible to get VCDS running under Wine.  Rather than fight the man, I restored the initial software load from a clonezilla backup, scraped all the crapware off, then installed AVG, Chrome, and VCDS.  Using Win 7 starter was a real eye opener for me and has only reinforced my already biased impression that Microsoft is a business first, and a software provider second.  Starter should be labelled as Win 7 Crippled because only an ethically funky company could offer a compromised version of their operating system and insist that it's for your own good.<br /><br />I'm of a very mixed feeling about the upgrade itself-the actual upgrade to Windows Home Premium from Starter went flawlessly and was over in 20 minutes.  Amazon provides the needed key, the Windows Anytime program accepted the key and did it's thing, and now I'm running Home Premium.  I would give it 5 stars for doing exactly what it's claimed to do-but that would overlook how Microsoft has created an artificial situation to chisel yet more money out of their users.  All the key does is activate features that were already present and loaded during the initial software load on the netbook.  That's it.  One could argue that these features were not needed for a netbook, but disabling customization features (such as changing the background) and limiting how many programs one can run simultaneously is simply taking advantage.  Even a little netbook has nearly the same processing power than a decent laptop from the heyday of Windows XP, there's simply no reason for these limitations.  It's not as if they customized Starter for netbook use to any great degree, it has the same basic interface as the other versions of Win 7 with less flexibility.  The fact is once upgraded to Home Premium the netbook runs just as well (if not better) as it did under Starter, and I can now do some customization and tweaking I couldn't do before.  In other words, Starter does not provide any advantages to a netbook over Home Premium and the cost to Microsoft to produce the software package itself is exactly the same.  So I'm knocking a point off just because Microsoft has done it yet again, and found a way to provide an upgrade path that shouldn't exist.<br /><br />TL:DR-buy the key and upgrade Starter to Home Premium.  It's a ripoff but it's the only way to get full use out of the operating system."
1,I coud not use it.<br />Poor quality. Preferred to pay for Office and go on from there.<br />Thanks for asking.
4,"I have been using Avast for many years. A computer programer/analyst recommended this company to me when Avast was a free product. I was having so much trouble with all of the most popular products such as Notron & McAfee.  When Avast catches Malware, you know immediately to shutdown your computer. It also works well with other products and not causing problems with the function of your computer. I have felt safe and secure with Avast for many years and I refuse to use anything else. Other products you get with a new computer--I delete before I ever start using and add on my AVAST! The product is updated every time I turn on my computer and I run their scans at least once a week to stay current. So we upgraded to the Premier 2014 since we are traveling so much now. My computers run smoothy and faster with this product. With AVAST I have never &#34;crashed&#34;. Can you say the same for the product you use?"
0,I had last used Quicken 10years ago. I recently purchased the online version. The first thing it wanted was my online banking. I don't have that. It is a very difficult program to use. Not like the old quicken. I started my business witha personal loan. I have been unable to simply input my purchases etc. How do I return this item and get an older version?
2,"I have Dragon Dictate on both my Mac Book and on a PC (computer appropriate versions).  On both machines, the program is what I would consider to be adequate.  The quality of the voice recognition is pretty good but the program causes operational problems with both types of computers.  After having to do work arounds and reboots, it is easier not to use."
1,"I only upgraded because my wife needed it. I am not a fan of Microsoft's latest versions. They were always known for bloatware. Now whether it is Office or Windows 8, they take simple tasks and make it that much harder for people to get things done. Basically, the only reason for getting this was that my wife is more used to this interface. I would prefer to just switch over to LibreOffice. The last version I liked was Office 2001."
1,"Before this purchase, we used a Windows XP computer for Quicken.  Quicken for Windows is outstanding:  It works consistently, automatically downloads from our banks and brokerages and cards and there's an automatic back-up feature for $10/year.<br /><br />We don't understand why Intuit didn't make the features in that version work in the Mac version.<br /><br />The features that are there don't work on the Mac.  My bank showed me downloads on their PCs - the Mac version says you can't download directly from the bank.<br /><br />In addition, when you have problems (and you will), support is provided by chat only.  Pay CLOSE ATTENTION to the screen.  When the support folks are talking to you it doesn't make a sound or change colors.  You get disconnected frequently.<br /><br />I've turned on my PC again and I'll be using Quicken for Windows.<br /><br />Intuit, this product sucks and I want my money back!  I refuse to &#34;chat,&#34; with someone overseas anymore."
2,because free I am college student on a budget and i cant afford to purchase the software for Antivirus<br />hard time
1,I was disappointed. Im using other programs with easier functions to use
3,"Great protection and customer support! All I had to do is set it up once about 2 years ago, and then I just keep buying these subscriptions and entering the product keys to maintain the protection. I've had no problems whatsoever with firewall or software conflicts. Only thing keeping it from a 5 star rating is the fact that once every few months or so, it detects and error and has to re-install itself (for me that means I only have to get rid of the desktop icon again each time, so it's pretty minor).<br /><br />One possible product suggestion for Symantec: make a variation of this product available for the same price that has Norton Internet Security for PC's and mobile devices on a per device basis (most people don't need 5 devices covered with Norton 360 Multi Device, they only need 2 or 3). (possibly time to break out the six sigma and do a QFD)"
3,I use it every year. Works great. Quick delivery.
4,Easy to use and I received bites from employers right away!  It's worth the money you cannot afford not to buy it!
2,"I wish that the program was much, MUCH more user friendly, ad cost much less money, it is a necessary evil"
2,"Because I just don't want to change or spend any time on software tools like Quicken, I always get the new version every 3 years. Short answer is it's okay. Mainly topical improvement. Definitely not a complete redesign. Looks the same pretty much as 2011. There were some improvements made to the Budget section, but they were not intuitive. Some of the balances don't make sense. Help is not really there, even the forums don't really help in a way that is quick. Reminds me of car designs in the 70's. Companies rolled out the same basic design every year but with a few extra features. Seems that Intuit is just trying to limp along with the same old program."
1,Typical Microsoft product. Too expensive and way too many gadgets that few really need or want. It does what's advertised and the only reason people keep buying Microsoft junk is because the new operating systems break the older versions or make them harder to use...
2,Didn't work as I expected. Kept getting requests to purchase and never worked first time.
4,The program does everything I need it to do.  I like the ability to get the 1 PC/1user license. You can't get better protection for the price.
3,A Gift
1,"I read lots of reviews and decided to give this a try. After about an hour, I decided it was a waste."
4,"The math portion of the Mac product actually has a real division symbol! On hte PC version, you have to buy the add-on Math-Type to be able to put division problems (for a math test; the &#34;house&#34; kind of symbol) on it."
4,I have been using Quicken for many years. Each year Quicken comes up with new features that are needed in this day and age. That's what I call keeping up with the times.
1,"I've used Microsoft Movie Maker, but I wanted an upgrade.  The reviews I read in magazines said this was easy to use and intuitive.  I did not find it to be that at all."
4,"I purchasesd the Microsoft Windowsm7 Anytime Upgrade (Starter to Home Premium) (Oneline<br />code) from Amazon.com.  This was a great transaction, code was sent immediately.  It was super easy to install, only taking a few minutes to install.  I love it!"
4,works great
0,You aren't able to do state taxes with this program! It says CA state taxes coming soon! Even thought you purchased it now.
0,"Waited two months for software to update to complete its Obamacare calculations.  Final update tells me I cannot file with their software, rather than fix the problem.  I smell a lawsuit."
4,"I had always used MAGIX Audio Cleaning Lab and loved it.  Then when I got a new computer with Windows 8 I upgraded to the MAGIX 2013 and was amazed at all the new features.  It's much, much better now!"
0,"It is not an improvement over their rudimentary Mac version, which isn't good.  The new version seems to open up 2 copies of every account I click on.  When I download my transactions, it doesn't recognize that I already have that account in Quicken, so it tries to create a new account rather than integrate the data into the existing account. I can double click to save a transaction, but I can't seem to find a &#34;save&#34; button.  I'm baffled by the categories it creates for my transactions, which don't match the ones I've always used before. How do I schedule recurring transactions?  I don't know.  I don't even want to try to enter a transfer between accounts, because I'm sure it'll just duplicate the transaction.  Everything is difficult and ponderous.  It is so inferior to the PC version, that it is even worse than the PC version from a decade ago.  I really have nothing positive to say about Quicken for Mac 2015.  I was hoping for so much more."
3,It would be too early to rate this program since it is in its initial set up stages. Possibly requires another 30-60 days
4,"It is a great suite of tools that will allow for creating \\""word\\"" style documents, spreadsheets, presentations and databases (like access).  For a free alternative to the more widely used tools, I would definitely recommend it.  It can be a little slow, but I have known it to be stable.<br /><br />It doesn't wow, but you it does the same job as its proprietary counterparts.  Personally, I prefer non-proprietary file formats, so I don't have to pay someone like M$ to work with my own data."
2,"I have used this for quite a few years, and bought this years version from the DVD they sent me.<br /><br />I had two problems, both annoying, and one potentially serious.<br /><br />1) Since I had the first cut, there were several updates.  I could not install the first update at all, and they had to send me a new version of the software with the updates installed.  Later, there was another update, and I could not install that either, that is, until I disabled my anti-virus software.  Then the update was successful.  This is annoying, and potentially very annoying if it happens near April 15.  And I bet most people won't think of this.<br /><br />2) I live in Pennsylvania, and we have some income from small trusts.  These come with a K-1 form for the federal return, and an RK-1 for the state return.  H&R Block passes the income from the K-1 to the state return and then applies the income info from the RK-1 return.  In past years, it has, within the state program, reversed the K-1 amounts, but not this year!  If I hadn't caught the discrepancy, we would have paid Pennsylvania tax on this income TWICE.<br /><br />I was reluctant to spend a huge amount of time online with H&R Block, so resolved this by making a copy of the tax file and then deleting the K-1 info from that copy, thus eliminating the chance that it could be counted twice.  To demonstrate that this would work, I did the same thing with a copy of the 2013 tax file, and decided that my workaround worked.<br /><br />This may only be a problem in Pennsylvania, but you can see that this is a problem that many people may not see and so may pay more to the state than they should.  I doubt the state would catch it.<br /><br />Therefore, three stars for this year."
4,I do professional photography and videography for event's and selling merchandise. Does exactly what I need.
1,The software promised up to 5 returns. Worked great for the first 3. Customer service couldn't  even figure out why. Working on refund now
3,"I had it for less than a month.  But, it already very helpful.  I am looking forward to using it more."
3,Great program runs great on Linux. The bad news is it looks like Corel has abandoned the program and the community. They fired the original developers. There has never been any official announcement and the AfterShot Pro forums are totally ignored. Just go on them and read.<br /><br />Buy it if you need a great program but just know it might just stay exactly how it is for years to come.
0,"I've been using TurboTax since at least 1997.  Every year they seem to get worse and worse.<br /><br />I've been trying to file my Michigan return now for a week.  I need to file MI-2210 underpayment of estimated taxes.  This form was finalized by the state of Michigan in November 2013. Last week they said it would be available on 2/14.  Today is Feb 18th and TurboTax still says it won't be available for download until 3/5.  They continually just delay these forms for some reason.  This is continually adding additional penalty and interest every day that I cannot file my return.<br /><br />All other tax software have this form available in their product to file today.  Why does TurboTax not have this form completed?  It's not like you have to rewrite the program every year.  Basically just update the tax rules in the system.  This is not that complicated of a job.  I am an application developer, so I know what's involved in this type of product.<br /><br />I've called and asked what the holdup was and support basically just spewed the standard &#34;we're waiting on the form to be finalized by the state.  They say it will be available on 3/5&#34; and would not give any further information.  They said if you try and file through one of the other software systems, it will come back with the same error.  I've gone through TaxAct and gotten all the way to filing the return and it has no errors holding up the filing so that is not true.<br /><br />When talking to support I asked about information on returning the product and they sent me an email about their &#34;Maximum Refund Guarantee&#34;. Not related at all."
3,Completed our tax returns smoothly and well in time - thanks to TurboTax!
4,"Great product; fast, easy and mistake-proof ... TurboTax has made the annual 'chore' of doing my taxes a 'breeze'."
4,"When Intuit advised me they were going to stop updating my Quicken 2010 I started to use mint.com. You get what you pay for. Mint does not consistently keep accounts up to date, and adding your own transactions can be a pain (they are not subtracted from your balance until they clear your account). With Quicken you can keep an accurate record of your spending because you can manually add a transaction, have it deduct this from your balance, then reconcile your account with the bank. I do not use the One step update, I instead log into my bank's website and manually download transactions. It's not a big deal really, and you can set Quicken up to automatically reconcile your transactions. I really like to mobile sync function also. With the mobile app you can always see what your balances are. Overall I'm pleased."

1,"It does not have word pronunciations. It just pronounces parts of the words.  I guess I read the product description wrong. Because I now have a meter internet service, I need an offline dictionary.  Also seems complicated to use.  Click the wrong button you do not get a definition and yet I have not found the synonyms, if there is one.  I was hoping I could find a simple software that came with the hard cover of the American Heritage Dictionary.  It was easy to use and had everything I need.  However, new operating systems made that program obsolete."
0,THIS PRODUCT IS USELESS AND NO ONE SHOULD WASTE THEIR MONEY ON IT. ITS SUCK AND NOTHING GOOD FROM IT.
1,I don't remember order this.
0,Difficult  to use.
2,"NIS has been my product of choice for many years. Amazon's online delivery was great. Unfortunately, I purchased this product for use on my Windows 8 machine. Norton did a very poor job of adapting its product to Win 8. Finally, after many phone calls and many hot patches and 4 months late, the software works correctly. I'm very disappointed with Norton in the way it handled the change to the Windows 8 operating system."

0,Not sure why there is any description at all for this item. Here's the deal. The features of this software consist of two icons that will appear on your monitor after downloading the &#34;software&#34;. These icons will then lead you to nothing. Sound like fun. Buy a few blank discs download what is on them. Then you will find yourself having more fun earlier without the hassle of deleting useless icons and probably have a lot of money left over depending on what brand and type blank discs you've bought. Enjoy!
0,"Many thanks to all that took the time to warn that greedy Intuit gutted TT Basic. I just ordered H&R Block Basic on the strength of reviews here. We (the crowd in the cloud) need to make it crystal clear to greedy Intuit that this tactic just won't fly.<br /><br />I have been a loyal TurboTax user for many many years, but I simply cannot abide being bent over like this!"
2,"Long time user 15+ years, this version continues to keep our basic checking and savings accounts in balance . The tracking of our investments, is a little bit more questionable. For investments you have had over 10 years,  there are injuries that must be made so you can reconcile, and I have no idea how to calculate those entries. There are no help instructions  on this issue or topics to help you understand what information is needed."
2,"I've been a user of Intuit's quicken software for at least 12 years if not more. I upgrade every 2 to 3 years in the hopes that some of the bugs will be fixed. I've seen lots and lots of bugs. I occasionally get database corruption, and several times it's been so bad as to be unrecoverable so I had to start over with my finances, and lose continuity of history! The interactive response during online updates is terrible. But this release seems to be a little better. Interactive response is improved. Updates are faster. So far it's looking better than previous releases, and this is the first time in my experience one of Intuit's quicken software updates has improved my experience."
3,"I first started using Avast because it used a fraction of the RAM that other antiviruses used. It also had much fewer false positives, and it wouldn't automatically delete the false positives (I lost some important files to other antiviruses).<br /><br />Finally, it also caught more viruses than other programs, so I've used avast for around six years now.<br /><br />The downside is Avast is getting more naggy. It's started popping up ads more often. It gets annoying when I'm trying to type a e-mail or chat down in the bottom right corner. But you can fix these by changing how long the pop-ups appear, setting them to one second minimizes how in the way they get.<br /><br />I still plan to keep using it, it still seems light and fast, and has plenty of good features for a free antivirus."
0,I've used Pinnacle Studio for several years and I can say without a doubt each version has gotten more unreliable. With version 17.6 Ultimate I spend more time fixing software bugs and never get a chance to edit my movies. Save your $79 and get a real editor like Adobe Premiere Elements or AVS. At least they work.
1,does not followthe basic steps for soving the problems it gives information and then you have to choose the answer with very little formal information on the steps to follow
0,"I've used TurboTax for years, but, like many other people, was upset about the change TurboTax made this year to move certain kinds of financial transactions to a higher priced product. Specifically, Turbox Tax wanted me to spend significant additional money just to record the info about a small stock sale of under $1,000. I said no way and took advantage of the free offer H&R Block software made to disgruntled TurboTax users. The H&R Block software worked just fine, and I will H&R Block next year for my taxes."

1,"I am 80% of the way through my tax return and so far, no issues to report.<br />What DOES make me angry though is the way Intuit &#34;gouges&#34; the users for the TOTAL &#34;USE&#34; COST to complete a federal and state return with EFile!<br /><br />A lot of people complained last year about local Tax Preparers (WE ALL KNOW WHO THEY ARE)  and the fees they charged of their services. Truth be told, it is almost worth it to have your taxes done by those folks when you consider the time it takes to do it yourself.<br /><br />Congrats Intui!  You ruined Quicken for the Mac - now your getting greedy with the customers that made you successful during tax season!"
3,"Easy install, has your back online.Same program that came with computer.Real fair price for a year subscrpition. Will buy another next time."
2,HAVENT HAD TIME TO TOUBLESHOOT THIS PRODUCT...WHEN YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS TO DOWNLOAD THIS PRODUCT IT GIVES YOU AN ERROR CODE &#34;PAGE NOT FOUND&#34; SO FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU ARE EXPECTING TO USE PRODUCT PER PRODUCT DETAIL. I ORDED SIMILAR PRODUCT FOR NOW.
3,"Let's get the obvious out of the way first: yes, it's unfortunate that Intuit has been de-contenting TT for years now, this year to the point that TT 'Deluxe' is no longer suitable for those with even the most basic investment income. So much for &#34;Deluxe&#34;; maybe they should come up with a better naming system to go along with their changes. I knocked a star off the review for this reason, since this is a yearly incremental updated product, and removing features YoY is pretty bad practice and a blatant lazy attempt to improve profits.<br /><br />I ONLY took one star away because, frankly, it's still easy to use and it works (when you buy the appropriate level package). I spent days and days trying with a competitor's (cheaper) software, which badly mishandled some of my investment income, resulting in a situation where I'd have to manually override much of the return, and lose the ability to e-file entirely. For under $60, TT Premier had a properly sorted Federal return ready for me in about 2 hours. Yes, that's about twice what the other software cost me, but I'd gladly pay the price again to get back the hours I spent fighting with the cheaper competitor's product.<br /><br />I hope Intuit reverses course in future years, or at least stops pulling content from their intermediate level products, because they really are useful and get the job done."
0,Did not down load!  Had a problem asked for refund!  Please make sure the refund is done and I am notified!
2,"In comparison to the version of MS Office that can be installed on a computer, the 365 version is weak. It's slow in coming up and it's slow when being used, even when it has a strong wifi connection. And, the pale gray background is a terrible contrast to the more colorful version. If not for the price, I'd ditch it and return to the other version."
1,"I've used Quicken since the 2003 version, and it hasn't changed much other than a couple features each year. In fact if it wasn't for incompatibilities with financial institutions that appear around upgrade time on older versions I probably wouldn't have upgraded every year.<br /><br />This year a feature was added that allows scheduled transactions to be seen inline, this was a very welcome change as I was doing it manually, however, there has been a couple bugs with the process never the less. Specifically it will only properly calculation the scheduled amount for a credit card payment for the next payment and not subsequent ones.<br /><br />There also seems to be a memory leak somewhere in the investment part of the program, as I enter transactions there the program gradually becomes slower.<br /><br />I'm sure Intuit will fix some of these items in subsequent service releases, however, it is par for the course for them lately for new software to be buggy."
3,"Great product, easy to use....just wish they gave you unlimited efile"
0,"I was disappointed that I could not export a large size banner file in pdf format to a commercial printer.  The only file save option available is specific to this software.  Useless to me.  I read the info on the spec sheet and saw that banners were listed as something the program creates, but there isn't any way to use/print them.  I would not recommend this product."
1,"For the discounted price it is a good tool to have for songwriters when it works right, but It wasn't working like it should have been and after playing tag email with the company for over one month's time, I got tired of feeling like I was making a wasted effort trying to get the problem solved and then getting the run-a-round for it in the process, and finally just called Amazon and made them aware of the situation; I really wanted the program to work because I need it as a songwriting tool; So far the mobile IOS app seems to be working ok. We'll see; Time will tell;"
4,"It took a bit of getting used to, moving to a newer version, but works well. Easy download and fire up!"
1,"I'll start by saying that if Office 2003 still existed, I would use it.  I am no fan of the ribbon, which has lots of things I don't need, and lacks some of the things I need.  (Yes, it's somewhat customizable, but not as much as the menus used to be.)<br /><br />But this is about 2013, which to my mind is largely a deprovement from Office 2010.<br /><br />There is however one improvement I can think of: One can now comment on comments in Word, which is a lot better than trying to select the same text someone else selected, and adding a comment to that.  (My cat is sitting on my lap and trying to type, so if you read here about more improvements, that's her opinion.  My mileage may vary.)<br /><br />Ok, so the deprovements.  Do a web search for &#34;ugly office 2013&#34; and see how many hits you get.  About 43 million on Google (no, that is not an exaggeration.)  The icons look like something you'd find in a VGA-era program, and faded as if they'd been sitting out in the sun that long.  The interface is available in three almost indistinguishable shades of battleship gray.  You can choose some kind of artwork for the top of the window, which is about as helpful as painting daisies on the aforementioned battleship.<br /><br />The menus (ok, top-level ribbon labels) are in UPPER CASE (I haven't seen this since the Apple I).<br /><br />When you want to open a file, or do a save-as, you switch to some other view entirely, where you can't see the file you've been working on.<br /><br />The top bar on the window no longer changes colors depending on whether the Office app has keyboard focus--I can't tell you how many times I've tried to delete a message from Outlook, or a word from Word, and I've instead deleted something from some other program I have open--because I can't tell by looking whether the Office app has focus.  (Ok, if you change your Windows scheme to a high contrast scheme, it will change, but then lots of other things--like web page backgrounds in browsers--are invisible.)<br /><br />And finally, good luck if you want to change the size of an Office window.  Used to be you could grab any border with your mouse and drag it.  You still can, but you have to play with the mouse until the mouse cursor changes--I believe it's because the borders used to be (and still are, in non-Office apps) several pixels wide.  But the Office borders are a single pixel, making it very hard to mouse them.<br /><br />So those are the UI problems with this.  Granted, Microsoft has to do something every few years to make people want to buy a new version.  What could they have done that would have made me want to use it?  Several things: fix legal numbering in Word, fix styles in Word, add a better method for moving emails to folders in Outlook, add styles in Powerpoint, and add commenting in Powerpoint.  (I'm not a big Excel user, so no opinions there.)<br /><br />Legal numbering is the kind of section numbering in which the first level sections are numbered 1, 2, 3..., the second level sections 1.1, 1.2..., 2.1... and so forth.  It's used in lots of disciplines, not just by lawyers.  And in all the decades of Word's existence, this has never worked right.  When one bug gets fixed, another is introduced.  The current system is simply incomprehensible.  I think you have to define each level, but the directions (on websites where this is discussed) are long and complex, and IIUC separate the numbering style from the heading style.  I'm increasingly using LaTeX, and there *it just works*.  Why Word can't make it just work, I don't know.<br /><br />Styles are supposed to be a way of maintaining consistency in formatting of complex documents.  For some reason, &#34;Normal&#34; is the default style, which is wrong (Body text should be, because that's what you usually type).  That's always been a problem, but Word 2013 (or maybe 2010?) introduced several more problems.  Titles, subtitles and section headers default to a bewildering range of odd fonts, colors, italics etc.  (Why did they think I wanted blue section headings?)  Yes, you can change all this, but why shouldn't it come out of the box with some reasonable defaults?  If you use the styles palette, it defaults to a recommended set of styles; whoever decided what was recommended must not write the kind of documents I write.  I have to change the options to display &#34;all styles&#34;, and even then I have to choose to sort them alphabetically instead of by &#34;recommended.&#34;  (If I don't want to use just the recommended styles, why would I want to see them in the recommended order?)  And finally, the styles seem to sometimes work, and sometimes have no effect.  If you have the cursor in a paragraph, and click on one of the styles, the paragraph should immediately adopt that style.  For reasons I haven't worked out, this doesn't always happen.<br /><br />Moving emails to folders in Outlook: If you have five or ten folders, it isn't too painful to drag an email to one of those folders, and there's even a list of recently used folders, or you can create a list of &#34;favorite&#34; folders.  But I've been at my current company for almost ten years, and I have hundreds of folders, arranged hierarchically.  And while I haven't accessed some of those folders in years, I probably go to fifty or more different folders in a week.  I swear the icons that toggle whether a folder is open (so you can see the sub-folders under it) get smaller with every version.  (It can't be that I'm getting older.)  At any rate, it is painful to mouse around looking for the right folder, and scrolling the folder list if I've got a long list of folders open.  (Like lists of employees, or non-employee people I know
