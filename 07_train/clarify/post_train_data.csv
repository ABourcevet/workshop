Digital_Software,"Well QHAB has been updated 6 times since October 1st.<br /><br />Things like your register disappered after paying off a loan and took 2 updates before it was fixed.<br /><br />You would think after 20+ years of making this product they would understand how accounting works and stop making such buggy software!<br /><br />It finally works right now, but I am sure there will be many more patches to come!",1
Digital_Software,Product didn't really break any new ground this year but it is an old reliable tool that I been satisfied with for many years.  It would be nice if the State Income Tax portion was included but I can't have it all.,3
Digital_Software,I have used Norton products for quite awhile now and never had a problem. There customer service is always available and very helpful.,5
Digital_Software,GREAT,5
Digital_Software,"I finally decided to &#34;upgrade&#34; from the discontinued Microsoft Office Accounting to QuickBooks, primarily because QB has a conversion tool that imported my existing accounting data.  Sadly, that was the ONLY benefit I've found so far.<br /><br />On both my desktop and laptop, which are fairly powerful machines with lots of RAM and dual-core Intel processors, the program is very slow. It takes a few minutes to even load, then when it does, every click takes 10-20 seconds (or more) to open a window.  This lack of performance alone makes the program unusable to me.",2
Digital_Software,"The product wasn't what my daughter needed, but per your rules I couldn't return an online/virtual item. My daughter couldn't use it; so I'm out of $35.",2
Digital_Software,"Many reviews have been written about the outstanding capabilities of Photoshop - it's amazing. I will instead focus on something not so amazing - trying to download it.<br /><br />Adobe nearly went bankrupt 20 years ago because of piracy, so they have really made it difficult to use illegal copies. For that matter, they made it difficult to use legitimate copies as well! In order to use the software, Adobe requires that one enter a product key, which Amazon.com doesn't give to you. Instead, one must go to the Adobe website and get a product key yourself. Because this is a Student and Teacher addition, Adobe really goes out of their way to make sure you're a student or teacher. So far, in fact, that I was forced to submit my report card into their website so they could prove to themselves that I was a student! If you go to a public school or college, you will most likely have it much easier than I did, since my small private school wasn't recognized by Adobe.<br /><br />The whole thing is a pain. I don't want my personal stuff floating around on Adobe's servers, and I don't want to have to wait a day while some Adobe employee checks out my school. Don't get me wrong - Photoshop is amazing and I think it was worth the effort to get it for three hundred dollars off, but I believe the hassle was completely unnecessary.<br /><br />Again, if you are a student or teacher at a well known school, you will likely have fewer difficulties than I did. In any event, either Amazon.com or Adobe should figure out a better way to sell their products.",4
Digital_Software,"I bought this just for general budget/spending, and it is horrible.  Most of the time it won't sync up with my accounts, and when it does the numbers are all messes up.  Unfortunately, I can't get my money back.  I will never by Quicken again.",1
Digital_Software,"The program will want to auto-update when you first start it. DO NOT proceed with that... if you do, you may find (at the minimum) that you are unable to import last year's return!  Instead, click on the link to H&R Block's \\""update center\\"" - [...] - and download the update from there. ALSO: if you have backup disks attached to your mac while updating, it will take forever to update, because for some messed up reason the updater wants to search every volume mounted on your computer.    Once I was able to properly update the software, it all seems to be working fine... though I haven't yet finished my return.",4
Digital_Software,"I found this product hard to use and inaccurate in downloading and using information from my bank. The totals provided were different then what was actually in my account even when allowing for pending and complteted actions. It was necessary to continually make manual corrections to the Quicken register. I found that I can accomplish the same thing with my on-line banking, savings, and stock trading accounts that I can with Quicken with less work. Since I downloaded this program, I have erased it from my computer and have requested a refund from Intuit.",1
Digital_Video_Games,"Very similar to Bejeweled, only not as fun.  It runs a lot slower and just lacks the addicting element that the original has.  There are some original twists to this version, such as dropping the puzzle pieces to complete the level and completing puzzles to move on.  Also the board shapes vary as opposed to just being square.  Overall though it really didn't hold me.  I made it about ten minutes into the free trial before I closed it out.",3
Digital_Video_Games,ok,3
Digital_Video_Games,"cute little game, but after playing for about 30 minutes it starts to get real boring.  for the price not a bad option to download and just have for those days when you need a break from  rise of nations, simcity or what ever games you typically play.",3
Digital_Video_Games,Love this game but had 4-5 soldiers stuck in sickbay forever due to some glitch...Hopefully this will be fixed soon.,3
Digital_Video_Games,"Haven't actually had a chance to play the game yet (I'll revise my rating if needed) but I wanted to let people know that you don't need to pay the exorbitant Mac price. Since this is just a Steam activation code, you can download versions for both Mac and PC with the code Amazon provides.",5
Digital_Video_Games,it was fun to start but the warm up ended up being the whole game next thing i knew it was over wtf man not worth it,3
Digital_Video_Games,"Great old game!  The times may have passed me by with the high end gaming that goes on, but this is just fun!",4
Digital_Video_Games,At least it was cheap. I lost interest in the game very quickly. wouldnt reccomend it even at the price.,2
Digital_Video_Games,"The online reviews don't lie..... from the expansive open world to the upgrade menu, everything about this game makes you become part of it and the story is engrossing.",4
Digital_Video_Games,"Bulletstorm is a good old no-brain shooter: it is linear, brutal and fun, in the line of [[ASIN:B009GKT28G Painkiller]] which was originally created by the same developers. It's a lot of fun requiring not much thinking, and the score-based system encouraging to do \\""artistic\\"" kills is a nice addition.<br /><br />That said, Bulletstorm isn't anything more. The solo campaign is very short and the multiplayer inexistant, graphics and animation are nice without being overly impressive, and the profanity gets old quite fast. A good game to get on sale for under $10, but nothing to shake up the very competitive FPS landscape.",3
Gift Card,Amazon gift cards are a great gift. The recipient can choose from all the great things Amazon has to offer.,5
Gift Card,"This was a birthday gift card for my son. I checked the box for personalized message and wrote one. He received only the envelope with the gift card, nothing written anywhere inside as to whom it was from. When I called him on his birthday and asked, he said, &#34;great, now I know who sent this!&#34; I don't think I'll be using Amazon gift cards anymore, at least not the snail-mailed kind.",2
Gift Card,"Got this for my mom, it's a great gift for kindle readers, I got myself one this Christmas as well because I also love to read.",5
Gift Card,It was great! It was easy! By printing from home I was able to hide the gift card from my husband instead of having to race to the front door to get the delivery of a gift card before my husband could figure it was something for him.,5
Gift Card,"Someone hacked into my account & sent  this to themself or a friend using my details. Too easy to scam someone with this kind of thing!!!! I am not happy. They have sent three now, one after I changed my password and notified Amazon.",1
Gift Card,How can you go wrong with a gift card. Not sure what else to say about this purchase. Thank you.,5
Gift Card,Thoughr it was adorable!,4
Gift Card,Xmas gift so I won't know how it is until then.,3
Gift Card,"im very disappointed, i was not aware about the percentage for de purchase of the gift card, this alter my shopping so I could not purchase multiple products, sorry im very disappointed",2
Gift Card,It's very easy to get the Gift Card and the best it never expire!!,5
